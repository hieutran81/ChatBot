Forget it.
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
Then that's all you had to say.
You always been this selfish?
Who?
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
In 9th.  For a month
But you hate Joey
As in...
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
So did you
Perm?
But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
Get out!
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
He seems like he thrives on danger
Okay!  I wasn't sure
So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
Don't make me do it, man
A hundred bucks a date.
Do what?
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
Who cares?
You didn't
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
You -- covered in my vomit.
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
I thought you were above all that
What?
Were you in jail?
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
The duck?
I hate peas.
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
Oh huh
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
Because I like to torture you.
Enough!
Then tell them I had a seizure.
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
No -- impressed.
When I go?
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
Right.
What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?
Just for now.
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
Make anyone cry today?
Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
We'll all go crazy...
If they agree to follow me, yes.
Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
Are we going to argue?
Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
He never had one... except aboard my ships!
Good!  We are also in need of judges.  Except there are no thieves!
What...?  Do I have so many already?
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
You never learned how to speak my language.
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
I knew you would.
New worlds create new people.
What did they say about Granada before today?
That she was impregnable.
Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
We came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days!  So we will be brave and swallow our grief.  And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.
You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
Yes.  Yes, come with me!
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
What else do you need?
Divorced.
Do you live alone?  I've been in these clothes since...the killings.  Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody?
So...the station is empty?
I'm just trying to find out who you are.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
Nah, why should you?
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
Raw deal.
Yeah.
Good - be tough to the end.  Actor who plays you will want to die like hero.
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
Okay.
Hey.
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
Well, that's great.
I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
You promise?
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
Dog food.
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
Can you show me?  Sir, no cameras in the FIS area!
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up!
Your idea?  I thought it was my idea.
Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
You spent all the money while I was in prison?  Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!?
Paulie, you've got kids, right?
This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
Thanks.  Appreciate it.
He's my collar!
He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
What??
There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
Yeah?
Aren't you tired?
Sure, what is it?
It's about my salary cheques.
Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
No.
Two more.
Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.
I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
Are you coming to my party?
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
Well, I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June.
Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
Well, I'm glad about that.
Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
Well, thank you very much, and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable.
Roger.
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
Goodbye.
No time for any of that crap any more, lady... I'll rip your lungs out if you don't answer fast.
In the back.  Down the other corridor.
Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
You're crazy.
You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
You gonna let me keep any of it?
In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?
...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
Hey, you know what I really think?
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
I get that. The job first. Everything else, especially me, second. I get it. I don't like it.
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
You want that Indian to snap her neck?
Don't give me this, we were partners.
Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away...
You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe.
No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
Good luck..
Of course.
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
Yes..thank God..
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
Yes. Of course..
Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...
...So Cornelius was telling the truth!
Hey bud! Finger here.
Take them and put them in a safe place.
We will be ready, Lord.
Yes ma..
All I want is an explanation! I just got in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab. I got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!! Now settle down and explain to me calmly..
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
...Ma???
How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.
You have nine points left on your license..
This is a police control action..
It's like a cab isn't it?
Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.
You have won the annual Gemini contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two. Congratulations. Here are your tickets.
Oh, yes you will...
Which one?
...Like love...
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
Wonderful!
It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
Options.
Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.
You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ?
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
You don't understand...
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
What?
The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
I'm telling you...
And they are?
I want to watch you work.
I'd rather you didn't.
Right here.
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
Eddie.
Yeah.
The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?
I was well compensated.
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
How much?
How much do you make now?
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
Specialty product.
It's their Presidential Suite.
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
"Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.
Nope.
My condolences.
I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.
This is a movie showing a girl being murdered.  She's sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife...  I only watched what I could.
Nothing remotely like this.
You're joking.
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
I hope it's nothing serious.
She just seemed... depressed... ?
I had to ask.  I apologize.
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
Those are her belongings.
I can't find him.
Yeah, or turn you into toast.
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
Three days.
Save it for later.  Come on!
It was Freddy.
What else?  You ever look over this town's history?  Not a safe place to be a teenager.  Anyway, if I'm next, watch your back.
Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
Mother, you've just murdered me.  Take that to your goddamn therapy...
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
It's okay, Dan
Huh?
Jesus!  Don't do that!
No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.
Me too.
Sobering...
They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
Krueger is reality.
So did Dan.
That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
Nobody thinks that.
Next life.  Oh, what's that?
My undying love.  Have some.
Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
I'd sooner swim!
So they caught up with you, too?
Huh?
Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F
Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
There is.  I believe our friend...Cyclops... is returning to life!
Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - -
It'll be all right.  We're old friends!
- for horrors like yourself?
I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study.  We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.'
But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
No. Black.
Always has been.
You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
Twombley involved?
No.
How soon?
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
Yeah. I know. The custody suit thing was just my getting back at her. I'm not as dumb as I look. Whatever you say. I love my daughter.  I'll send you the five hundred.
We bought you.
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
You might not kill it.
You think so.
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
Mmm.
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
Piece of fucking cake.
On your sleeve.
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
No what?
Yes.
See, I knew you'd be mad.
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
Where's the plow?
I figured you already heard.
Twombley, Jesus. We got to get moving: I got to get up there. How would I know? C'mon, you drive. We'll take my truck.
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
Yeah.
I'm sorry about what I said.
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
Yeah. I mean that.
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
Then... I guess you have to.
Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
Yes. Here's your ticket.
He's asleep. We were up very late.
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
Can't it wait, then?
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
Yeah.
You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
Huh?
Yeah, I guess.
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
Shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the woods, you say it was an accident, you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. Jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled.
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
Some kids were teasing you?
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
Yeah. Do you know what the word &quot;asshole&quot; means.
It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.
You are a resilient man, Mr.
Been better, Dad... You?
Okay, I'm slowing us down.
Yes. They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails.
Okay, you're aerated. To dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump. There's no switch in Avionics so you'll have to cross the wires. There should be five wires, just to your left. Do you see them?
Stay cool.
Holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you're making demands.
Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
My loyalty was never to my country.
Nine.
Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs.
Romeo Tango Zulu1 this is Tower.
That was war.
No.
Yes, sir.
She's a big girl.  She understands.
How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
I miss you. And I miss her.
Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
Other way around, sir.
Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.
You better check it, Unger.
You better take this.
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
Elaine, what's going on?
Set!
You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
Yes, sir.
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
Look, a man can make an honest mistake!! Anyway, she was asking for it!  They're all asking for it all the time!!
Scraps.
Do you like it when Scraps sleeps on his back, Jimmy?
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
All right, it's a matter of death.
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time.
No. I'm all alone.
That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me.
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
You can't take a guess for another two hours?
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
I love you.
It's a big building where the generals meet. But that's not important right now. They've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid. Isn't that good news?
And a little ice!
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan.
Who wants to be first?
Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
Huh?
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
Ss'ai k'ss?  Perfect.
Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
My partner is dead!  Because one of you bastards killed him -- then disappeared into a rathole down in Slagtown, where he's home and dry, 'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody says nothing...
Yeah, sure.  I knew that...
I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
When will Strader return?
Please, I must get out here.
... and Porter ran a piece of shit mom-and-pop mini-mart.  So what the hell's the connection?
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
Harcourt is dead.
Well, one of the men didn't like him so much...
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
The human?
I can't!  Do you mind!
Position?
Talk to me, Hudson.
Uh, seems to be in front and behind.
Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
Could it be intelligent?
What?
All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?
Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
Now, wait a second --
Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.
Shit.  Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there.
All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
Are you finished?  You okay?
Let's get these things lit.
Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
We didn't miss anything.
Don't be long, Ellen.
Anytime.  Anywhere.
You're just reading me.
The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
Think of what?  We're fucked.
Terrible.
Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
Why do they tell little kids that?
Did you ever have a baby?
Yes.  A little girl.
It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.
Sweet Jesus.
Certainly!
What do you mean?
In a harem.
You were sublime.
Don't bother.
Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.
But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
I want to go back to Vienna.
Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
What?
Eat
Eat my - ah!
No!
I love you! I love you!
Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?
What?
I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?
Shut up! I'll not let you put anything in my hand until I see some money.
Give me two more weeks. Please.
Then he didn't send you?
No, sir. This is my own idea.
Why you?
Where's our friend?
Money! Money!
Do you hear him? Do you?
Behold!
Majesty.
You do me too much honour, Sire.
You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
Really?
Of course, welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa!
Don't you have a maid?
It couldn't be better.
This one will.
I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?
Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.'
Good morning, sir.
I will, sir.
Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
Yes what?
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
I liked the horse.
I tell you I picked up a snake in Dresden last week - twelve foot long  - folds up to six inches, just like a paper fan. It's a miracle.
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
This is Herr Mozart, my dear. The young man Herr Salieri recommended to teach our Gertrude. Where is she?
No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours.
Herr Sommer.
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful.
Do you have a daughter?
I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do?
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
What work?
A Mass for the dead.
No, no! I promise you, I'll give you a wonderful piece - the best I ever can!
You mean she's not coming back?
Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.
Are you ill?
What?
Oh, yes.
We ended in F Major?
Yes.
Yes.
I'm not leaving you.
I was foolish. I thought you did not care for my work - or me. Forgive me. Forgive me!
Just let me tell you how it begins.
Taking out what you should never have put in.
Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
Mozart -
Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
Baron!
I do not seek forgiveness.
Where?
And do they believe it?
Should I?
Exactly.
Where?
Incredible.
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.
The American? Yes, duck.
The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
Come to my office, Miss Price.
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
What did he say?
David says Jack comes to warn him.
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
He's fine. We'll come right over.
Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
Aw come on, Alex!
I was. What are you reading?
Do you like it?
My best friend. My very best friend.
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
It's nice to see you.
Yes?
Okay.
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.
Jack is dead!
No!
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
Alex?
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
Bambi?
You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten.
Yes.
Did you see Jack?
Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
I don't know.
Shall we?
Right.
You ask them.
Apparently so.
I heard that.
Come on, where?
A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
Nurse!
Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
Get out of here, Jack!
I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
I will not accept this! Now go away!
I want you to meet some people.
Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him.
Campari and soda would do nicely.
We'll find him, not to worry.
Why not?
Yeah.
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
Take it easy, Clark.
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
Oh!
Why, of course.
Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
I haven't got it.
I'm sorry, Dude, butI
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
Why, I needed a
Line?
Well, what?
I want to be near you!
My apartment.
Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.
No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.
What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
Happy now?
No.
All right. Send him in.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Got my letter?
Hello, Helen.
Yes, sir.
Well, I
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
Gee, thanks, Mr. Dickson
Good.  You've got nothing to worry about. Soon as the report comes in, you'll be released.  And listen, don't talk so loud. Take it easy. Coast a little.
Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
Oh, Charlie again.
Mr. Williams . . .
Yes, why?
What time did you get in?
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
Best damn plan I heard all war.
Suit yourself. We'll have some horses waiting for you at the road.  Let's ride, Rangers!
It's better. It's a construction depot. They'll have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take. That way we can take on a bigger job.
And I'm the better outlaw.
The brown one.
They're just insurance in case we run.
This here is the Younger Gang!
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
Me get heap firewater --
Fine. I'll just wait here.
My little Web did that?
Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
You can shut up now.
Bob's upset.
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
They're making him a hero now.
But he killed a lot of men, too.
We're just fine, thank you, sir.
Take care of each other, boys. You say your prayers.
You were little Jesse James when you left.
Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
What?
Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
You cocky little bastard.
I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.
Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
Not at all.
I just though you were awful cute.
Lyla Devereux.
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
Really?
By burning down their homes?
Move you fools!
A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
Sir?
I remember you.
I want them arrested and hanged!
I demand action.
No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course,  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?
I know. Stop it.
Eight?
Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?
I just want to have a child. Just...two... perfect...children... 
What do you want, Courtney?
Yes?
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
I don't want to talk about it.
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
Oh God, I can't believe this.
What are the rules for a sweater vest?
Nice.
I know her. I knew her.
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"
No, he doesn't.
There was no ad in the Times.
Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s fabulous. That's rich...
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
It's a fucking milligram of Sweet'n Low!
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN  Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now?
Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
I said we are totally booked.
See you then.
I'll do it.
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
Who's Ted Bundy?
I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you want me to go?
What are I doing?
I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it.
That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you.
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.
Listen, if you could talk to them  I would really appreciate it. I'm really late. I have a lunch appointment at Hubert's in fifteen minutes.
Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank you, uh... Victoria?
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
Who?
I want the number, idiot.  Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you later and if I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I'm going to sic my hairdresser on you.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Oh that? Just mulling over business problems. Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors... Spreading gossip.
I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but I was supposed to talk to Luis Carruthers and he wasn't in and...well, you're here, so...I know how busy you guys can get.
Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  Not on "Page Six" at least.
Who do you ask?
No, I guess it's okay.
Yale thing?
No, he just hung out there.
I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.
I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
Great, yes, I'd like that.
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
I'm so hungry.
Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on the job?
What am I gonna do?
Yeah, well, you're late.
Another Martini, Paul?
No, man. I'm gonna bail.
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.
'Gonna wait outside.
But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
I think that's great, Milo. I do.
Teddy was killed last night.
What're you -- what?
They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
...Whaddo I do?
What?
Milo, you --
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
Like I said: shot in the dark.
...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
Sure, I'll see what I can do.
Gimme the coordinates?
He's working backwards, too.  Let's do number five?
Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
Would you like a Coke or something?
It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
Maybe I'm going too fast.
It helps. Alice said it would help. To focus on something.  'Don't know what I'd do without her.
...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.
I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.
Let's go.
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
We'll come up with the next big thing.
Keep looking.
They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later.
I'm calling Gary.
You know mine.
Show me.
Then and now.  But not right now.
But why would they --?
You know. There is no second place. And what's the risk? The killings're undetectable, they're hand-tailored, they make "sense." I mean, they're in the information business. They have scenarios for all of us, too. In case we find out too much.
They'd frame him.
They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge."
You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?
And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished.
'Cause their apartments might be bugged?
What'd he say?
"A beautiful geek? What're the chances?"
Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.
He's been altering the coordinates since we logged on. He's a step ahead. Let's jump to #12.
Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff.
Jesus, Teddy.
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
What does that mean?
Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.
Groovy.
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
Is it about my teeth?
If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man.
A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
You mean Mrs. Kensington?
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Thanks.
Where is Vanessa, by the way?
Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
Austin, I have something for you as well.
Yes Basil?
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
"You can't always get what you want!" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit.
Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
I'm sure.
Do you want to talk to him?
Why?
Let me see.
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
Not in the Nineties.
Out and about, doing odds and sods.
I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional.
Who?
Shut up.
Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!--
I love you, Austin.
It says here, name Danger Powers.
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
Silence!
Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
My son?
Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
They're mutated sea bass.
Please allow me to demonstrate.
Not me.
An evil petting zoo?
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
In due time.
I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
One more peep out of you and you're grounded. Let's begin.
Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.
OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
... death ...
Peter ...
Promised? Who promised?
Impossible?
Quite right, but we still make the rules.
Ropes?
I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.
The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
Thank you, Steed.
Thanks, Valentine ...
An unholy trinity ...
Much better.
Why should they think that?
You mean my other self ...
But if someone miniaturized the process...
Mrs. Peel ... ?
Was I?
To kill me?
Because you always obey orders ...
Is that all?
I'm a wanted woman, I know ...
Have we been invited?
Intoxicating. Here, have one of these.
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.
Our little paradise -- just made for two?
Pity your mother came, too ...
It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated.  Wait here.
Half-brother to be precise.
Surveillance? By whom?
Makes two of us.
Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together? But that's absurd.
I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?
So you say ...
Amnesia?
Possibly. Split personality ...
No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all.
You are, and it's behind you.
No. As far as they're concerned the only good Rick is a dead Rick. But I don't care... it's my decision.
You're kidding.
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
I'm ready to make you another deal.
The best.
You've had it. I'm gonna get you.
She's mine!
Yes I did.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
Are you going to have women at your party?
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
Oh... I got something for that.
Um... that's very relaxing.
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
I don't want that. I want to be with you.
This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
Ilene, Rick promised...
Debbie, don't be naive. Men are pigs.
Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.
I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?
Why?
Because I'm pissed off. Now give me your cash.
That's more like it.
Let's have a toast.
I didn't know you were into that.
Larry, you and your wife got problems?
All right, who serves?
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
No, Brett, I...
Of course.
So long, Father.
What's with her costume?
You got it.
I don't know.
I'd love to get you in an operating room. Just once.
Yeah...
Let me take the lead, Stephen...
I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
What, you've never seen one before?
It works.
So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
Brian --  -- See ya tonight.
Fuck you.
Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...
I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
-- What are you doing here?
We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
Shut up!
What, you think I just dried up and blew away when you left? The world does turn once in awhile Brian, even without your permission.
Yeah...
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.
But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
Yeah? And just how much of all this has been "doing your job"?
I don't know anything about it.
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
So you came to me...  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all...
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
Then who --
Trychticholorate.
-- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.
Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
-- Another backdraft.
And the putty around the door?
Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
Did I say thanks?
Just wondering.
-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
It isn't mine.  Let's get a picture.
There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
Management were pin heads.
They're waitin' man.
Yeah? When was the last time?
-- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.
There's something else kinda interesting...
That's your job.
You like everybody, Ronald.
Absolutely.
And the world -- the whole world.
I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?
This'll only take a minute. There's two cops outside that want to ask you about this --
Who said anything about the fucking street. I've got more connects than you have, Lieutenant...
They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.
Yeah.
Why?
Yeah.
Why do I dream every night of the whore who brought you water on your road to death? And why have I never forgotten that if she, then I --
All right, cop. I want my money.
It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.
All right. What are you gonna do?
This psycho can.
I'm on it.
...that simpleton is holding back the race.  They got rid of us and keep those two buffoons, Mantan and Sleep 'N Eat, y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
Alright.  Here we go.  Let's go NIGGERS!  LET'S GO NIGGERS!
So now I see where you're coming from.  Just because we ain't rapping about Gucci, Timberland, Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo.
In fact, we never knew she had any friends period.
I'm out.
Damn skippy.
You can walk away.  We both can.
My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
I'm tired of waiting.
Well do something about it.
Mantan?  I don't even care as long as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, I need some new kicks.
Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.
Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?
Can I finish?  Thank you.  I had a great Aunt, we called her Sister. She went to her grave not believing man had walked on the Moon. 
So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.
Are these our two stars, sitting here in front of my nose?  Which one is Mantan again?
Who are the other characters?
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.
I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.
I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped.
Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
You getting cold feet?
C'mon.  You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family.  You gave your brother a shot.  That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot.  He got his.
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
Tomorrow it will be all about cruelty to animals or some sex scandal.  Besides, there is no such thing as bad publicity.
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?
I just turned twenty.
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.
And this is my very best friend Mantan.
No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
Go to your windows and yell out, scream with all the life you can muster up inside your assaulted, bruised and battered bodies.  I'M SICK AND TIRED OF NIGGERS AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE!
The one with da big...
She hates dem.
Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
...yes she did.
Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?
Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
A song a comin' I feel.
Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.
Enough.
You don't read, do you?
And what?
Don't try to change to the subject.
Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.
It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
Only a very little, as soldiers do.
The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?
He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.
And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.
Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
We must write to her today, and you can tell her that you are safe and married to "Brown Bess."
I have heard of them.
Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
Your honor must lower his voice.
Who else can give me information about you?
But how, sir?
Certain?
But, for a time... a passing fancy?
Not one.
How so?
Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.
Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
By name only.
Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
Yes?
The milkmaid's daughter?
I think, Sir William Cosgrove, you have had too much drink.  Your chaplin, Mr. Hunt, has introduced me into the company of your lady to advise me on a religious matter, of which she is a considerable expert.
He wants to step into my shoes!  He wants to step into my shoes!
Who?
I'm -- I'm sorry...
It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!
You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
They're dead, aren't they?
This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
Yeah, we know, Pike did.
You saw West's body.
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
There were six of us...
No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?
Yeah.
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
So did we. Why didn't you come?
Do I?
From up close or far away?
That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.
Can I go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot?
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
I was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.
Because I was standing next to him.
I don't know --
And I'm the closest thing to it, right?
He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.
That's horseshit and you know it.
Maybe. But it's my fault and I'll carry it.
You're drunk --
You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.
For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
Something like that. You?
Not the happiest of memories?
I lied. Wait for it...
That means under a year. Let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me -- murder is basic. There are no conspiracies, no grand mysteries, and no evil puppet masters behind it all, pulling the strings; murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people -- it doesn't always make sense but it's always neat. Dunbar's our guy.
Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
Get in.
Far as I'm concerned, whatever you did in the past can stay in the past.
Although that won't matter much when coupled with the murder charge --
What, "The Truth"? Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they seem.
He whispered it in my ear.
What?
It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!
Wrong answer --
Childs.
So you framed him. The same way Childs was going to frame Pike.
He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him...
Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
I used it to start the fire --
-- failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself --
No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
That's great.
Why?
I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.
I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.
Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
I'm not scared.
You learned from the best.
You're right.
You mean, while I'm here.
You know where the chemicals are?
Dad!
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."
I have been nothing but myself since the day I was born. And if you can't see that, it's your failing, not mine.
The River!
Story of my life.
I have the rest of my life to find out.
There is no softer ground than town.
I'm robbing this place.
I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork.
Mmm, what. I know better than to argue romance with a French woman.
Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
You didn't need to do that. You just didn't.
True. But I've known him my whole life, and I don't feel like I know him at all. Or ever will.
He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.
Yes.
Thank you.
Leave him!
You can see why it's sensitive?
You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
He says he feels safe here.
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
I...
You can stay tonight.
I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
Yes.
Happy bath day.
I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.
Well as it turns out I did.
In every sense. If at all possible.
Well, Nadia, It it's all the same to you, I'd like to give it a bash.
I don't have any money.
I don't want to talk about him.
Oh Jesus.
No.
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all.
Because it was a lie.
I'm sorry.
It's not mine either.
Oh! Gave me a start.
I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'.
Well. It's good to see you.
Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.
Well. Hope you enjoy it.
Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.
That young lady's size, right'cher.
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She listened to me.  And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her...
Make yourself at home. You done it already.
You go to hell.
I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...
I bet you did. Just had to get that black cock up in you. I swear to God. What Ronnie sees... you disgust me.
Say what you gotta say, but I ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. Not never. You hear?
That damned, rusty, radiator, bout burned the skin off my legs each time I passed.
You better pray, gal. You better pray...
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
Or what? OR WHAT?
Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
You been in and out goin' on two... maybe two days.
Well I don't...
What do you want?
Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE!
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
I said... STOP!
He told me... get help. I just stood there and watched him... I watched him die, Laz. Oh God! GODDAMMIT!
I know you didn't. But you a grown girl. You can handle it. I got to.
You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.
No, you do it. I can't sing.
You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
A naked woman, chained in ya house?
What's that chain around her for?
THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT? THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT?
This all looks wonderful.
I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
She's tied to me, R.L.. We tied to each other.
What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...
Naw... I got it, Mr. Lazarus.  You wanna tip me, best do it in butter beans. Momma say she need a bag 'a yours, none of that store-bought junk. That's what she said.
That's right.
Rae, look at Ronnie. And tell him how you feel.
Just about anything, you know. It can be funny or... not. Just tell me somethin'.
All them people shoutin' your name like they were doing tonight! Shit! That arm you got'll get'chu on a box of cereal...
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
Only thing I'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what I should'a done.
Eh, if the bootie fits...
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
Why the hell not?
I couldn't keep up.  My shame is complete.
We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
Nick...
If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside.
Shut-up.
So I bring some cheese?
It's done.  You don't have to come.
No.
I don't give tours.
Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
Unavailable.
Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
This by this...
Yeah.
I planned on catching him, Captain.
He killed a police officer.
It is not allowed.
Work with me.  I want your best detective.
Why don't you ask your chief detective?
Twenty-four hours, detective.
Goodbye, officer.
The families who control the casinos?
Not with these bills.  And even if it only took them six months, do you know what our profit margin would be?
We were worried to death.  It's awfully kind of you.
Here's your check, my boy.  Thank you.
Death.
Why?
We've already tried it -- ethyl methane sulfonate is an alkylating agent and a potent mutagen -- it creates a virus so lethal the subject was destroyed before we left the table.
When?
What was he after?
There wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure.  But bio- chemical data and morphology records of the Nexus-6 were reported missing.  Going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff tests on the new employees.  Guess he found himself one.
Where do we start?
Yeah.
Who.
Next.
Vodka!
One more, eh?
Well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled.
True.
What night?
That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.
You talking about the Opera House on the Main?
What shows?
I don't know nothing about it.
Little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress.
So?
Right.
I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
How are you doing?
Not too good.
You mean a woman?
Because it's not.
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
No, I don't.
That some of the folks around here are more programmed then me.
Next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is.
Holden got hit.
Five, maybe six.
All pertinent information is being fed into your departmental computer, an Esper 231 -- I believe -- and a photo over-lay packet is being produced.
What desert?
I never seen a turtle.
I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?
We sure did.
Yes.  I couldn't pass the test.
Yes?
No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
What?!
Are you French?
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.
Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!
Over this?
I can't, it's yours.
Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
Then forget it.
Why?!
It didn't used to be that way.
One who's not a mutant.
Two weeks.
Of course.
Yes!
I like it.
Yes!
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
And don't be so obvious!
What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her?
Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
Sing it to me.
Yes.
The front door is open.  Will you be back?
They're pretty.  Can I have them?
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
No. Sit down.
Because he must!
These are really swell! I mean swell!
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
That's what everybody believes?
Uh-huh.
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
Gladly.
Good!
What?
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!
Really?
Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat?
I never know anymore.
Yes, dear!
Really?
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Right here!
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
Coming!
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
We do?
I want him to at least see the sky!
--and we will--
Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!
I knew you'd like him.
That's what I'm sensing.
Let me show you the entire trousseau!
He didn't leave with them.
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
Then what?
We came back to the house!
I'll give it to ya, no money down. The neighborhood has gone to hell anyway.
Roger, Wolf One.
I'm not sick.
Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it.
Yes.
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
Only you and the photo lab.
Not yet.
Pest control, gotta do your apartment.
Yeah.
Well.
Never before this.
Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please.
See my nipples?
You can kiss them if you want. Feel them. They're getting hard.
Yes, I like you.
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
I'm alright. Go hide. This won't take long. Be quiet.
Don? Are you in with them?
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.
What if I told Frank that you opened me?
Shut up.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
Don. Help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
Hello, daddy.
Mommy's here.
He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Go where?
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
Yes.
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.
Be right down.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
Would you like a piece of cake?
I'll get a coat for her.
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
How is Central these days?
I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
I guess you have to get back home soon?
Where are they?
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
It's not bad, but it's bad enough. It's a lot worse for my father.  I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world.
You've got a point there.
Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
Who, me? Why should it?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Okay, okay.
Jeffrey!!
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
You didn't tell him about me?
Where to?
It's okay.
You look beautiful.
No.
Probably not. No. Why?
No Jeffrey!!
You can change it if you want to.
Just for him?
Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver?
I can't find the second one, sir.
The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?
You're not being charged. It's up to you. Do you want to talk to them?
Get a hold of yourself, man.
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
This place is like a scumbag yard sale.
Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.
This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.
Pull the trigger?! Have ya lost it woman?! Now just calm down here.
BLAME...
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
I'll call you tonight, afterwards. 
Fuck!
Ass!
How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
He got beat up by a girl.
No pictures, either.
A bit.
Me, too.
Oh, you're good. What were you gonna do? Laugh the last three to death, funny man?
And he is one smart man.
Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name- ology.
How do you figure?
Friends, Gentlemen. They were friends.
I felt it would bring closure to our relationship!
My, my...
Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little... 
Pee...Per...Man.
And is there an American, shit is there a man seated among us that hasn't thought about it many times, let's just put them all on an island, give them guns and let them kill each other. This is our wet dream come true. You can expect federal and local law enforcement to go only deep enough to satisfy the law, then bury it from here on out.
Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.
Why do you always disrespect me like that?
Witness?
A couple of peons for the mob and...
Oh that's just BEAUTIFUL! All the scumbags in the quiet city of Boston start dropping dead and you think it's unrelated?! Greenly, the day I want the Boston Police doing my thinking for me, I will have a fucking tag on my toe! Now, get me a squad car and get me over there. I want the crime scene photos and any witness statements. NOW!
We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always doing business, but we're always open.
No. You sure you're okay?
Those cocksuckers sold me out!
So?
What the fuck do you mean?
What is it my son?
I guess not.
I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.
He says, "What's your third wish?" And the guys says, "I-I want you to beat me half to death."
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
What do you think the cops have?
Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
No, just do it real quick.  I'll meet you down there.
No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.
We know there's another stocker.
Like he meant it.
Like he would find Dignan. One day.
Anthony, we're on the run. This is an emergency. It's only fair that...
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
No kidding.
Where was I?
You were asleep.
So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --
We need a car.
Don't panic, Anthony.
I know.
That's what she is!
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
What's Hinckley Cold Storage?
Right now.
What the fuck are we doing out here?
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
Eleven fifteen.
It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.
Nobody move!
Careful. Check his pulse.
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
I'll see you there.
Yes, there is. Let's get organized.
We haven't heard from Applejack since he got out of the hospital. His case got dismissed.
We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.
Yeah. Convert it into lofts. OK. Pop quiz. What's the single most important aspect of your job?
The Abe Henry double-cross test. You just made a perfect score.
How'd he do?
Anthony, I'm petrified.
Because I was like you once. And there was no one there to help me.
Who?
Yeah. I've stolen two cars before. One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With T- Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to drive.
Well, I didn't mean to electrocute him. But the whole operation was my idea.
That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
No.
You're Anthony?
Feel this.
Looks like he's staying with Buckethead. That's what I figured. He's probably got his own room. Let's see where he's going.
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
My brother.
You're paranoid, Bob.
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
No. I was calm.
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
Bob, I've got nightmares.
Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
Don't threaten me, Bob.
Man, I don't want to go into this.
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
I didn't think there was an alarm.
Wait a second --
Hard to find it sitting by the pool drinking beer and bullshitting.
John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
This boy's a troublemaker. He used to tear this place apart.
Social issues. Crime prevention.
Did you hear that?
This is no good.
Where?
No, my friend knows her.
With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.
I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.
No. You lost your way.
Including Landy...  She had access to the archives.
Okay... 
Yes...
You killed them.
You know I'm not.
Look at me.
Conklin up front.
I worry when you get like this.
Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
Where are you going?
There's no choice.
Yes.
They know!  They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They know you and Conklin had something on the side. They don't know what it is, but they know!
It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
I killed him???
You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
What?
What? The tapes?
I'm getting on a plane to Berlin in 45 minutes, which means you are going to call me back in 30, and when I ask you where we stand, I had better be impressed. My mobile number is...
Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story.  Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?
You mean, did I want a date?
Did you?
What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
Are we locked up?
Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?
Peace?!
We cannot defeat this --
We cannot. Some scarcely believe you are alive. Other think you'll pay them Mornay's wages. We bid you to Edinburgh. Meet us at the city gates, two days from now, at sunset. Pledge us your pardon and we will unite behind you. Scotland will be one.
He has already agreed to come.
My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace.
While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!
Scotland. He intends --
Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
You may.
Wallace's followers.
When will his trial be?
You fancy him.
I don't want to be a martyr.
I wanna have supper waitin'.
You win.
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
Humbly, M'lord.
Let her speak.
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
It matters not, he is thy king!
I do not confess.
It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.
I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.
I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...
What?
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
No.
Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there.
My father has a bad memory, too?
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
Jesus himself couldn't make me take on the Brotherhood. When they come, just put your mind in another place, man. Be somewhere else.
Shit. I knew you were crazy.
I ain't bullshitting. Jesus speaks to me in my dreams.
You need to see the prison shrink, man.
Weirder than this?
Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
You know my father?
It's coming... argh! I can't!
But I... I need those books.
All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
Shhh! I need quiet for this.
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
I've stopped a hundred times.
I know, but...
Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
Why's that?
Well, don't give up now, Slick. You've already done so much for me. Hell, why don't you go back in time and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby. Then maybe Lenny wouldn't freak out and ruin my family.
Calm down, kid. Stand still.
Been there, done that.
You're kidding. He's so... big.
Gee, thanks friend.
Drop it or I'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep.
Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
What happened?? Where are we?!
You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff.
I'm sorry.
You're such a retard!
Could I speak to you for just a moment, please?
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
He did. Captain Renault did.
He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
Monsieur Rick!
Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
Oh, thank you, Herr Rick. Sacha will be happy to hear it. I owe him money.
But Sacha always puts out that light --
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
Er, my check, please.
Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
Well, good luck. But be careful.  You know you're being shadowed?
There are only two other alternatives for him.
Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again.
I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.
All right. At a quarter to five.  Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?
Oh, darling!
I don't know the finish yet.
I don't think I will, Rick.
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
Richard, I had to see you.
-- I wouldn't believe you, no matter what you told me. You'd say anything now to get what you want.
I wish I didn't love you so much.
Everything is quite all right.
-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
No.
She tried everything to get them, and nothing worked. She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me, but that was all over long ago. For your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and I let her pretend.
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
Goodnight.
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
I meant to, but something always held me up. I love you very much, Ilsa.
To tell you the truth, I am frightened too. Shall I remain here in our hotel room hiding, or shall I carry on the best I can?
Apparently he has the letters.
He suggested I ask you.
Ask me?
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
I beg your pardon?
What of it? Then it'll be out of it's misery.
I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.
Here it is.
I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
So it is. And we have a curfew here in Casablanca. It would never do for the Chief of Police to be found drinking after hours and have to fine himself.
Goodnight.
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.
Good day.
Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
What else, my dear Major?
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? Unofficially, of course.
How about New York?
If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
Find one.
When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.
I stick my neck out for nobody.
Manages what?
His escape.
Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.
And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.
-- Thanks. I will.
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
Well, I forgive you this time. But I'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde, and it will make me very happy if she loses. Uh huh!
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.
Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
Put that gun down.
Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
As soon as the plane goes, Louis.
Our expenses?
-- Sacha, call a cab.
Don't be afraid of that. Please keep them for me. Thank you. I knew I could trust you.
Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.
Just a little something of my own.
Thirsty.
They'd eat you if they could.  They're laughing at you.  Listen.
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel.  With Kelly.
It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.
Shut up.
Look again, asshole.  It's a mirage.
It matters.  We do the best we can, that's all we have.
As much as anybody.
Okay.  Sure.
No.  that was the last one.
Had a package to deliver.
Must be a story there.
I've got lots of time.
I figure, if we could take care of a puppy, we could, you know, take care of --
He's your cute thing.
And for you --
A ring.  I wanted a ring.
Could you watch Jango?
No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill --
A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?
Hey...hey...it's okay!
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last.
You too.
Terrific.  Yours?
There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an hour, goes through Sydney.
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
But all that's behind me.  I'm fine now.
There's settled folks, and there's nomads.  You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here.
I wanted to come here.
The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take me next.
Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear us?
Can you find her?
But I might not have.
We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice.
That's why I'm running foreign and you're not.  That's why you're not married and I am.
Right.  Get me everything on Indonesia, New Guinea, all the way to Australia.
This is Amber.  Her boyfriend lost his foot in a shark attack.
Want to see my raft?
I never thought it would end.  Then it did.  It was so great to be saved, I couldn't stop laughing.
That's all there is.
Deep, real deep.
Just find him some clothes, Wilbur. He could use some clothes.
"An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care..."
Dr. Homer Wells.
I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!
I doubt it. She's just an...
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
At least you were never lonely.
Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see.
It's a good thing I didn't have that baby, isn't it?
We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
I know.  Is *that* nothing.
No. You warned me. I didn't listen, but you warned me.
Rose, I know what's going on. Homer told me. I got pregnant, too--about a year ago.  I've been through this.
Yes, I *have*!
*Homer* liked it!  Didn't you?
You *bet* it's a heavy sedation! The fetus is unexpelled, her uterus is punctured, she has acute peritonitis, and there's a foreign object. I think it's a crochet hook.
He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway.
It's okay--I don't mind.
No, it's not serious. I'm just not supposed to get excited. You know-- no strain, no stress. I try to keep calm all the time.
Actually, I volunteered.
When it comes to this, you is the real thing--is that what you sayin'?
I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.
I haven't read that.
I'm happy I amuse you.
I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
Just promise me that, if there's a blizzard, you'll move into Wally's room until it's over.
It's just my heart.
I don't like watching anyone be sick.
Rose, please listen. Whatever you want to do, I can help you.
Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!
What view?
Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and take your time.
She took off on the bicycle, man.
You're welcome. I was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us.
I envy you guys. Taking a chance like that.
Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.
You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
Two million.
What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?
No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy looking for some answers.
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
Suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later someone's going to start asking the right questions. Usually, it takes a little longer.
That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark.
After you cut her loose.
So why don't you take a deep breath, Jake, and I'll count to ten. One. Two. Three...
What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced.
We sure Big Al threw him to us?
Let's go, Jake?
That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
Tonight. Just me.
No, not "whatever." You're either in or you're out.
And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow.
I think two million.
I think I just broke my hand.
Hey, listen... If you guys don't pay your taxes, that's your business.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Good boy.
Very much so.
LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me!
You interested in a little work?
Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?
You're working Daffy's block. He was going to break your kneecaps. Pick- pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I told him you were with us, so that's two you owe me.
Oooh. Sassy. What do you care who feels me up, Jake? Unless it kinda gotcha going. Did it, Jake? Getcha going?
Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily.
But the fucking Grand Poo-Bah of all jinxes? A bird in your house...
Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober. I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something.
You guys got busted. This is a great neck.
Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor, that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off.  He said he was going to "fuck some sense into me."
I don't know. I packed up my shit and ran away. To this... So unlike you, I guess I do have something to prove, in a repressed anger sort of way.
No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time.
Your friend, Big Al? It should have been you.
If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.
Then shut up.
You better get over to Al's. Now.
Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
Wait a second... Who's the mope?
Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
Pretty much.
In over your head?
Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.
Okay. Here's the thing... You fall flat, you might not get anything short of stiffed. Then it's Blue River Land for everybody. Papers like these are dangerous because papers tend to multiply, then they start to take shape. Usually it's the shape of an arrow. I hate to do it, but after this, I gotta give you the blowoff. We Jake, Jake?
I try.
So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
Look Special Agent Moonan... We don't know what you're talking about.
Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...
I got scared.
Not like Matt, you mean.
Now he's a real shit. Don't get friendly with him. I'm sure he's got his hand in the till. You know what he said to me once? "I want to fuck the whole world over. That's my mission." The shit!
I don't know anything about it.
Eight-fifty.
What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa?
Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
Good God, no. But with skill like that, what do you want a job for? You don't need to work.
I won't be that long.
I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.
Take it back. Till you sell your book.
Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.
I start Monday week.
I love you Jack, you know that.
You've got such beautiful hands.
Well, that's our life now, isn't it?
Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
It's none of my business what you write. And your job, that's none of my business either. I love you. And I've done everything wrong.
There was a message, wasn't there?
You're already alone.
No.
Yes, I know that.
So why did you come to my casino?
I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.
Your father?
Toss you for it.
I didn't.
I owe a lot of money.
Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
Wait a minute...
Let it go.
Do you?
Yes.
Too much. Eighteen hundred.
Thanks.
She's my baby.
I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers.
No thanks.
Don't worry, I won't report you!
"The world breaks everyone, and afterwards many are strong in the broken places." Ernest Hemingway.
Cheers. Happy New Year. I really like you, Jacko, you're so fucking straight.  Hey, you haven't changed your clothes!
What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
Any exceptions?
They've been tested.
Five.
Good call.
We have tapes in here that go back six months. Let me show you something.
I can see.
I think he's talking to it.
Check at six minutes.
Bomb #20 to Sergeant Pinback. Roger, I read you, continue.
Detonation in twenty minutes.
Of course.
It is intuitively obvious.
In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.
Exactly.
Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
You have no proof that it was correct data.
Mafhkin oble groop...
I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
Any planets?
-- automatic channels open --
It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...
I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
Phoenix?
Ah... pity, pity...
That's correct, sir.
What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
We're running out of time, sir.
Or we could go another way 'cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is.
Yeah, sure, I understand.
You're in the last two seconds, you don't cut the crap.
Who's Camille?
No.
Could you give us a moment.
Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
I ain't mad at you...
I'll make it worth your while.
It's a rule.
I know.
What else can we do?
But why can't we stay here?
No...
Then I'm gonna do what you do to make me feel better when I'm sad.
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
Who is...
Too early to tell.
What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
I'm not a half bad cook.
How do I know you didn't?
We are not fine.
C'mere, I want to show you something.
Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
How much do you know?
I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.
The technical term for you is "chimera"...
She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is?
That's deep.  But before you lecture me about the meaning of life maybe you oughta get one...ta ta.
That's what soldiers do, right?
With your help.
But she does work here?
How do I know you're telling the truth?
Look, I don't know what you want--
I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
Let go of my hand.
They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--
Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.
You're crazy.
Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
What?
How long you and me known each other?
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious...
Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
I have sincere eyes.
She's gonna want to hear for herself.
What's up?
Not half as pissed as she's gonna be when she finds out why I blew her off... I need your help, Max.
A toy?
She was the one--
Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot.
Gin.
My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw...
Well, shame on him if he doesn't.
Got any KISS?
Save your money, stud muffin. The lady at the end of the bar sends her love.
That'd be great. Hey, maybe someday your band'll play there. It's a college town, you know?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo.
Plenty, but it was all bad.
Weird...
Sunday, but...
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
Oh, yeah...?
Just listen up, man, cause we are in a quandary.
She was standing right over me when I was changing for fuck's sake.
Check.
Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass! The stella booted with your mom's wheels.
Okay, I'm just a little mad now! Jam, why'd you talk us into picking that bitch up in the first place!?
I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?
Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!
Beg pardon?
Not until like... eighth grade.
Donnie! Give it back!
I can do anything I want... and so can you...
We just want to guide you in the right direction.
You should already know that.  Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you.
Sure.
Fuck them.
Until it withers away.
That was a compliment.
Will you go with me?
Where are we going?
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.
Are you okay?
And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
Yeah...
No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.
Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die.
What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
Then go find her, Donnie. Don't let her get away.  She was right about the rabbits. Go.
All of this... certainly isn't your mother's fault, Donald.
His name is Frank.
I don't own a television.
I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
What did you find?
Yes.
I... I was playing with fire.
Regret.
I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going.
I have the power to build a time machine.
Where is he, Donald?
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
No I don't.  She worries about you.
Congratulations.
Frank?
You're not a bitch.
He died, remember? On the way to the prom.  He was doomed.
If you think Michael Dukakis will provide for this country prior to the point when you decide to squeeze one out, then I think you're misinformed.
Donnie? You're a dick.
You can suck a fuck.
I caught him flushing pills down the toilet. He knows you check the container.
Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
Rose... I don't know if you realise how great an opportunity this is for our daughters. This has been a dream of ours for a long time.  Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion.
Not Vanity. He's a homo.
She's right over there.
Oh God, I'm dead...
Yeah, you betcha...
Really, Loretta?
You-betcha.
Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.
...Yah -- well, at least, y'know, I got to perform. And Mom got to see me.  I guess number eight only worked for Diane Sawyer...
Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head.
Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.
I know.
So if, uh, you wanted to do somethin'...
You could be quiet.
Oh, Christ, it's true.
Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
This pageant's like a roach motel.
Hey, ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.
Becky was my only shot at state!
That's enough!
Let go! Let go of me. Oh my God, it's COPS!
Enid ate a whole pan!
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
The President of the United States.
Take another letter...  to my tailor.
He won't eh? - We'll see about that - send for your father immediately.
Yes -- why?
Then you don't wanna work hard?
I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs.
That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
You couldn't hang me in your bedroom -- I'll make a note of it.  Where's my secretary? 
I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
Give me that again!
Yes.
Bah!! 
Well, I won't stand for much.  And I won't stand for you if you don't show some improvement soon.  Look at your report card last month -- "D" in spelling...  six in behavior. Now who were the six?  A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't matriculate, now what were you saying?
I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything including, you.
Oh, your Excellency, you take me off my feet.
You can call me Gloria too.  Gloria -- what a beautiful name.  When I was born my mother named me Gloria -- two minutes later she found out her mistake...
WHAT  ?
What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
Gloria -- I've waited for years.  I won't be put off!  I love you!  I want you!  Can't you see that I'm at your feet?
This is terrible!
Oh?
How lovely.
And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
Oh Frederick.
He fell.  He falls.
That's the way he sleeps. If he lays down, he'll die.  Head's too heavy.
He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!
I want him back!
It's quite nutritious, sir.
No, more of an acquaintance.
He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.
Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?
Fine, fine. You know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, Treves. But you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here. Patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. Just don't become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them.
I'm sorry too. He simply doesn't belong here. He's be much happier somewhere else, where he could be constantly looked after. Believe me, Frederick, it's better that it worked out this way. Good day.
Well, yes.
Steady on, Treves. Have a seat.
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Oh no... no... you're a Romeo.
Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.
Is he... dying then?
Yes.
Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick.
Yyess.
My name is...
John Merrick.
Mmmerrick.
We do have a lot to talk about, don't we?
Very well, thank you. I have something for you, John. I'm sure you'll enjoy it, it's very popular.
Thank you very much.
Of course.
Friends. Ah yes, friends! How nice.
Here.
I thought as much.
Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
Yes! The workhouse!
Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it.
Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...
Very smart indeed.
Pardon me?
Never mind. I'm the owner.
I'll send a cab. Here is my card.
But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her...
Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.
But you LOVED her all the same...
And the week before that?
I mean, you could have killed yourself.
Erik. You don't understand.
The second note to wake the Gods...
It is day, of course, Freya.
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...
A lot of people like our singing.
You're just saying that.
Now I want you to be ABSOLUTELY, totally, genuinely honest with me. Did you really, truly, honestly like it?
Well, how d'you think I feel?
I know that the Great Blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand.
Looting and pillaging, eh?
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
Well you started it.
Aaagh! Rape!
Well... no...
He was lucky...  Sit there.
What?
You talking piffle, son?
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
Who have you been talking to?
So? What'd you do to her?
Why should WE care?
Bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end and stop all this fighting and bloodshed.
Oh... right!  Well... CHEERS everybody!
Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
We haven't got a spare place.
Let me do something for myself for a change!
The Dragon...
What do we have to do?
Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
I'm drowning! Help!
Help!
So did my father and his father before him.
Stop it!
Sh!
I'm just building up to it, Dad.
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit.
Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
Here we are.
Okay, I guess.
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
I like it.
I'm sure you would.
Yeah, I got it.
Shit. Shit. I know it's here. Hold on.
Yes?
But I think I am. I like to think I am.
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
Thanks.
Yeah.
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
Yes.
Okay.
Would you get me another, Joely?
Joel, you're a liar.
It's my favorite book. Since I was a kid. It's about these toys. There's this part where the skin Horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real.  I can't believe I'm crying already. He says, "It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."
Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...
Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden.
What?
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.
Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
Is that what you want?
You had the whole human race pegged.
It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
Me too. There's this poem --
Seems too coincidental that way.
It's dark.
Make love?
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
A bully? Moi?
I can't stop thinking about you.
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
I just wanted to say that. Come by my house.
I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
You must have been crazy.
I know. I had to take the day to think.
There are two of them. Couldn't make them out. The orange glow of a cigarette.
Any messages, Carmen?
I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
It was a mess. I don't know how it got this way...
You have to stop this!
I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
I miss you.
Hi, Mary. How's it going?
Sorry. I just --
Well, allow me to do the honors. It's fucking freezing and I need something.
I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things.
Nothing.
Mary... please. This is hurting people.
Thanks.
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
It's no big deal.
I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
Well, where was Patrick?
1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E, Rockville Center.
Just wanted to let you know.
Thanks, Stan. I owe you.
I'm staying with the Countess.
Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.'
If I flinch when you say you love me, it's both our problems. My confusion becomes your confusion. Students confuse teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts....
Well.... er...
I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault.
I have to go, Julian.
Why? Why do you have to go?
Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.
I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?
Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...
I heard it.
Justin?
You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...
On my way.
You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
Roger that.
Run!
No.
"Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
What happened?
Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.
Someone sent that message. Admiral, you have to put me on that ship.
Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
Skipper...
What about it?
Check the Core for radiation. Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries.
The "Other Place," what is that...?
You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
What are you trying to say? "If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings?"
Starck...
We don't have time to fart.
Come again, Skipper?
The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: "Bio-readings of indeterminate origin." Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels.
What's causing the readings?
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
I know that.
Stay here! Don't stop working!
Five seconds.
Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay...
She's not ugly.
Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith.
All boards are green, everything's five by five.
The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
Do they have pressure?
I'm alright. Please.
This ain't permanent. My friend Reed's working on a cure... I think.
Victor did.
Oh, he did.
I don't care about rocks, I care about you.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
Youthful high spirits.
Five times.
Solid.
Reed?... Sue?
Go back to the drawing board.
I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
So are you!
...and figure out how to reverse them. Let me show you to your rooms.
Right, whatever, have fun.
A higher calling like getting girls and making money?
Reed's always right. Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
And that's a good thing?
It's been changed.
That's good. That's uh... good.
You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
Reed, we're running out of time.
Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
I thought I'd take it off for the drive over to IBM. It's kind of uncomfortable.
No. I want my money back right now.
Hey-yo.
Your friends use the pool too.
Don't strain yourself.
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
Where did you hear that?
It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
But they weren't mine.
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
I think we're making a lot of noise.
I know it's yours.
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
Damone, you gotta listen to me.
No.
No. It's too soon.
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
Okay. Okay.  Here's what you do.
Did you go home and get it?
No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?
Sensitive -- what is that?
Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.
That's me, Merv.
Just be glad you're all right.
What should I do?
I can't do that.
Believe it.
No way! He just called him a dick.
Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?
Does that ever happen?
He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him.
Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.
I want romance.
Well I might go to Dartmouth.
What class?
This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window.
I couldn't make it in time.
I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
All right! Oh, yeah!
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Yes.
Sure thing.
Naw. I don't mind.
Sure.
John Bonham?
I'll get you the notes.
Awake? What do you mean?
Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."
Tell me. What do you want?
Crying? Why was she crying?
Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
Naw! Not a major.
He wanted the pineal gland.
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
Maybe thirty more minutes. As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed. It'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal. Are you ready for that? Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid.
Thirty minutes. It was going to be very close.
Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
GO?
Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.
You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.
Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.
What limes?
Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!
There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
I felt like a Nazi, but it had to be done.
Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!
Just the other day we had a case where they grabbed a girl right out of a McDonald's hamburger stand. She was a waitress, about sixteen years old... with a lot of people watching, too!
Hurry up with those drinks. We're thirsty. Only two rums. Make mine a Bloody Mary.
Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me. I got your message... what? Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what?  No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while. Yeah. I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out...
I remember thinking, "Jesus, what a terrible thing to lay on somebody with a head full of acid."
Sure. That's a good idea. One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.
Her eyes were turgid with fear, but her brain was functioning on some basic motor survival level.
Ridiculous! Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up. You never saw me before. Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles. I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. You ready?
Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
I'll try. I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time. I've heard a lot about it.
Part of what?
They'll get in! We'll all die!
Where's that?
OPEN THE DOOR!
And the head?
Well, justice is funny.
This is a bottleneck waiting to happen.
Look.
Gimme a couple dabs on the tongue.
The girl's got rhythm.
Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.
What?
No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.
What do you mean what?
Nothing.
Covered.
Holds four.
Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
Hey, when this plan completely goes to shit, what are ya gonna do?
Done. But you're locked in.  Will you hold the keys?
I'm fine! I'm fine!
If he doesn't shut up...
I'm done drinking. That's it. Just Church and grocery stores. Nothin' else.
YOU'LL HIT US!
GO-GO-GO!!
Stop her!
Let's lock off this room.
I'd love to.
Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh?
Come on. They make you feel nice and peppy.
What're you doing?
Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
I don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but I don't think it was me.
Very fine bone structure.
I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.
You're afraid!
Huh.
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
An actress.
What does Clifford say?
Right now we have to be practical.
He knows, Frances.
Get your clothes on, lady --
...Yes.
Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em?
Really?
Thank you.
Is Kaminski a Communist?
He's a socialist, then?
You really want to go?
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
I love you too, Francie.
As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
But, Kurt, I...
I don't believe this! You jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you don't even know who the hell I am!
I wouldn't miss it.
Why... yes.
You sound as if you hate it.
Not me. But other people seem to.
Whattaya mean?
Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.
Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
What?
You're not the quiet type, Frances.
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
I don't have what they want, Harry.  Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
The chauffeur. He's watching.
I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.
Calm down, Frances.
Harry, I hate being in love. I don't ever want to be in love again. I just hate it!
That's right.
Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!
What's that?
You give up on her?
I don't know.
Right. Except... time has a way of --
I hope so, Frances.
Just a little way.
It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
Who's writing this guy's lines?
Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at his face...
You are a deeply troubled young lady... I only hope you change your course before it's too late.
Who're you?
I'm preparin' it for the next tenant, he's coming in tomorrow.
Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, "This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.'
You got it.
Why are these all opened?
I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.
Among persons such as yourself, creative people under great stress, erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of. It's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which... 
I see.
Really? Any problems?
No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
No, I'm warning you! Who do you think you are, God? You bumble around with your folders...  ...and your pencils...  ...and your god-damn buttons...  ...all your badges of authority! But you have no authority! You're nothing! You're a zero!
Sedate her.
No!
You're kidding.
'Incurable.'
People can be kinder than you think.
I am afraid.
Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother.
A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
I'll be waiting. And watching.
I will not! Kill me now!
She's not for you.
Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
Fine.
God took her from us.
Quite a send-off, isn't it?
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
Not as weak as I.
I give you my soul...
Elizabeth. My more than sister.
I know only that he is a killer. And I shall bring back his carcass.
It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.
...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before.
Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
I've been preoccupied.
Yes? And?
Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
Victor, explain yourself.
To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.
Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
Who are you?
Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
You okay?
Want to see my trick shot? It's even better.
Sometimes I only think about kissing women.
Wait, wait! When I was finding these goodies in the shed. I also found this letter which a camper never sent home. Listen.
Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here.  Wait a minute, I'll get my diaphragm and be right with you.
He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
Mmmmmmmph.
Girls can't be cowboys.
The truth hurts.
It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.
In heaven.
Yes, she is.
Auto wreck.
Yes.
Yes.
I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
In other words, no.
My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
Scott?
Yes.
Yeah, we got a bible.
I'm really sorry.
Anytime.
Four Rangers, three cops, and two civilians. And they took a lady bank teller as a hostage.
Well that don't matter now, 'cause you got about two fuckin' seconds to live! Richie!
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
We are...  "South of the border down Mexico way."
Where are you?
No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother.
It don't look together.
That's what I hear.
Are you truly mouthin' off to a senior member of the Senate Arms Committee?  I mean, I'll give you points for style -- just nothin' for smarts.
Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch.  My office will follow up with details.  Jumping off, now...
I'm fine, sir.
Wouldn't dream of it, sir.
Sir, if someone is suggesting that I'm a lesbian, they're wrong.
I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed.
Basically -- he asked me if I could unring a bell.
West?
Hey.  Ain't your call, man.
Did you hear?
She made it through S.E.R.E. training.  Got a call this morning from --
My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now...
Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
Uh, ma'am.
Absolutely not.
Well, I spoke with Mr. Hayes this morning myself -- and told him the deal was off.  No more test cases. He was only too happy to oblige.  Don't play politics with me, little darlin'.  You'd be up way past your bedtime.
Do that.
... two... one... MARK!
If you can't feel the other guy's pecker, you ain't in tight enough! I want nuts to butts!
Flea!  O'Neil!  Why is there a break in that line?
I think you probably would -- if you didn't know I was right.
Not due in for 22 minutes, sir. Watcha got?
Only four minutes to neutral waters, sir.  Why not?
Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines.
Just like you would be.
I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it happen.
Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
Mighta been civilian.
I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!
Grab an oar, find a way to weight it down, we're gonna need it.  Cortez, help him.  Flea?  You take one of the two full minis -- and just follow my lead.
Should I be afraid?
Right down to your worthless womb, and I'll tell you why.  This is my island.  My world.  And here I can get away with shit that would get me arrested anywhere else in the world. Take another scan of my little joy- boy outside.  If I can do that to a Navy Seal, what's gonna happen to you?  Huh?
I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
No.
Say again?  How many micks?
Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.
O'Neil, Jordan.
Hmm.  Let's aim higher.
This is what you get for brain- picking an old CIA spook.  but if I needed to control the outcome of this test case, that's how I'd do it.  A man-in-place.  Makes everything very controllable.
Hey, hey! I'm eating here!
Audrey, you're too damned nice, that's your problem. Nice gets you nothin' in this town. You gotta be a killer to get ahead, you know what I'm sayin'? I'm sorry, baby, but you just don't got what it takes.
Great. See ya then.
No! I just couldn't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches. I wanted to have some adventure, some fun...
Yeah. Why are you asking?
Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one.
But we can get to the west side faster.
I have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to nature.
So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes?
Oh my God! They're coming!
He was my college sweetie! Look at him. He looks so handsome on t.v. What the hell is he doing in Panama.
Nick Tatopoulos.
That's the problem. He did.
What's it to you?
What do I get?
This is not the place...
Mr. Caiman...
Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
No. Perhaps I work too much.
You mean to tell me that there is no one who holds a special place in your heart?
I don't think so.
Have them sealed off.
Get your people out of there or I will.
Follow me.
We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
Last time you didn't even scratch it!
That's not true. Our worm guy, er, I mean, Dr. Tatopoulos found blood.
We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
It's the French Secret Service.
Why do you need that?
We, have already taken care of them.
Yes. This testing done by my country left a terrible mess. We are here to clean it up.
So you're in?
555-7600. Tell them it's a code dragonfly. They should get you through.
...Yes sir.  Your quarters sir.
I'm... I'm shot.
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
"The show must go on."
THIS much.
You go first! There's no time!
Oh, of course, I forgot! YOU have to be the hero, don't you?... Heaven forbid anyone else get the spotlight once! Oh no, Jason Nesmith couldn't possibly-
That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this?  Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT.  VIBRATIONS.  Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."
Oh, and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us?
No. I can't go out there! I won't say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time. I won't.  I can't!
They're drifting toward me... I think they're magnetic!...
You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
Hey, watch that "Laredo" shit.
Yes Commander... All right, you're almost there. Just go through the chompers and over the pit.
That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
Never mind, Fred....
No, no... I'll think on it...
I'll take my chances with Gorignak.
Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..
It's... I don't know.
We're doing episode 31?
You smiled at me.
Jason..
Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
Turn on the translation circuit.
We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
Tomorrow morning, before the store opening.
Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it.
I see them!  I see them! RD STREET	PASADENA 57
Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
Thanks
It was a lot of fun. You kids are great.
We have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations. The fault must lie with us, with the ship...
Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations.  It's all a fake.  I'm not him...  I'm a nothing. A nobody.
I think we're going to exit the space port.
It doesn't have eyes.
Over three hundred miles.
I've come to report that we've had a bit of luck!
Don't do anything rash, please, Benedict.
That can't be.
As soon as the men have good shelters I'll move.  Perhaps Martha will join me this winter.
Tell Mrs. Washington I am compelled to stay a while longer.
You've served me loyally, year after year, without complaining. I've thought hard about you this past winter.  I want to free you, Wil.  I want to give you your freedom, after this battle is fought.
By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
But it's what he said, just before they killed him:  "I regret that I have but one life to give to my country."
Get the body of our army up to Greene's vanguard as fast as we can.  All the damned fool has to do is hit the British rearguard and then hold for us.
Colonel Hamilton.  Anyone who served under Arnold, I want them shipped north.  I don't want any troops here who served under Arnold.
Who the hell knows?  Everyone's giving orders.  It's all very democratic.
Yes, an astonishing power over weak minds.
Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?
Detained by what?
Unofficially, General Greene.
George!  So good to be back!
How can you say that?
Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
These supplies...?
War?  No!  I did not!  When you said compromise was possible I believed it was probable.  There's no middle ground at all?  We're the King's children!
But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.
Have you been reading what Minister Jefferson has to say?  If he had his way, all our slaves would be freed no matter what the outcome. And that would destroy us as surely as a British victory.
To win this war I need an army.
Our 'kind'?  What is that supposed to mean?  These men are all I have left and they stay because they will fight!  They desire it!  They seek it!  Of course Virginia is terrified!  For my soldiers this is a war to obliterate the 'upper class' from the face of the earth! Should I tell them all to go home because if they win it will ruin me!?  It is impossible for me to imagine that Negroes are fighting so that only white men may be free! If we win this war they will own this country too!
We're leaving them?
Is that the truth?  Well, we can't carry on like animals any longer.
I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
Hear that, George?  Sally's actually taken to thinking of this clod of earth as her home.  And it's her first tour.  We're gratified, aren't we George?
Words, words, words!  Sally has been tutoring George in the philosophies, isn't that right?
Voltaire, of course...
Who says so?
And 'others', say... have you even read Locke, Vattel, Voltaire, Diderot...
This, this is life indeed!  Life worth preserving, Such life as Juba never felt till now.
Juba was a Numidian.
Hey, you want La Tierra Rent-A-Car just over there, but I think all they got are Rabbit convertibles.
So where's the money?
I mean I don't care.
Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him.
Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings?
Calm down, Bear...
Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
So... how many movies you been in?
Yayo. Where is he?
He's around someplace.
You can talk to me.
Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.
There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne.
We'll talk about that, Harry. But first I gotta know, how'd you hook up with Chili Palmer.
Hey, Zimm doesn't ask for dick. Zimm tells you the way it is... or else.
That's correct. Look at me.
'Cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me.
You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go.  Why haven't you left?
Get in line, bro.
You have a card in here?
That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.
What've you got?
I produce feature motion pictures, no TV. You mentioned Grotesque, that happened to be Grotesque Part II that Karen Flores was in. She starred in all three of my Slime Creatures releases you might have seen.
You just did.
I mean, the way you told it to me. Start at the beginning, we see how the story line develops.
That's half a movie, with holes in it. Maybe forty minutes of screen time. You don't even have a girl, a female lead, and on top of that, there's no one to sympathize with, you don't have a good guy.
So you don't work for the casino?
What do you get out of this?
They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
I had to tell 'em something.
That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.
I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.
Who?
One we're producing.
Now you're squinting like you need glasses.
Okay. I'm listening.
You're not going to tell me the rest?
I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.
Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
I know what a vig is.
But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.
I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.
I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
What do you think?
You and Harry'll make a great team.  I'm gonna make a deal with him.
What do you get out of it?
Definitely not Martin. Movie stars never pick up the check. They have no idea what things cost. Most of them don't know their zip code and a lot don't even know their own phone number.
Continental, but it doesn't matter. Martin won't order from the menu.
It's not Dave. It's a movie.
You're as bad as Harry...
How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
Get down here. I wanna talk to you. Come on... right now...  She's gonna talk to Martin?
How honorable of you.
Harry -
Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.
Yeah, Karen knows him.
Arctic Warrior, passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea day two month two year one nine five three.  Over.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coast Guard North Island Station. Over and out.
It's a beautiful country. Very clean. Very civilized. And cold.
I tell you one thing, we're not gonna be towing no ship now.
So we kill him?
I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain.  What happened up there?
Smugglers maybe.
The right way and the wrong way.
I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight off. Low man first.
Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.
Don't fall asleep.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
I feel fine.
It's my pen name.
They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.
Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.
For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.
The guy. He just came this way.
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
Besides a little rust, everything's pretty well-preserved.
Sorry.
Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
It's worth the effort. Believe me. Besides we're gonna need her to prove the salvage.
Maybe.
A what?
Better late than never.
Twenty. You knock off twenty and then we see. After my guy looks at it.
Not if I don't find that goddamn spatula.
Who?
Guess.
I guess.
What?
About what?
JUST DO IT!
I see... interesting...
And how does an image like this help us to see that?
As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...
So what do you think?
But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
It's not optional!
Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
So, where's "Weird Al"?
Hi.
Why?
When did I say I hated you?
Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
I know, she needs to die immediately.
Just look at them!
God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want.  It's such a weird feeling.
I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.
Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.
I dunno. John Ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that I have to fast-forward past to get to the good stuff.  There's supposed to be a Don Knotts movie on here someplace.
Why do I always have to do it?
I remember when I first started reading these I thought DWF stood for "dwarf!"
What does it stand for?
I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
Totally! Look!
Come on, it's too late now...
Gross!
It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
Oh yeah...
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.
Just promise you'll do it.
As always.
Should we leave a note?
Where?
You're gross.  See that guy?
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff.
I can't, it's Seymour's birthday...  Shit! What time is it?  I have to go to the store! I was going to make him a cake...
Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
Do you still want to do something tonight?
What happened to Seymour?
How repulsive!
I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.
What time?
Maybe an orange juice.
Shhh!
Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
Sure, I guess.
Well there's a few choice LPs in here that re-issue some really great old blues stuff.
Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?
Yeah, sure, I guess...
Watch my stuff.
I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything.
Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.
Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
Please, Seymour... Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we can't get any boys to take us...  Please?
Just wait here.
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
Hooray for me.
It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.
"Yet."
I dunno... because I can't stand the idea of a world where a guy like you can't get a date...
What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
What? Why?
Are you okay?
Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...
Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...
Then again, that's easy for me to say, since I'll never even get a date. I'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you.
Why?
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
Well, uh... I'm an expert-about stuff like this -- she was totally for real!
Sounds good...
Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...
What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more.
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?
Yeah, well I like you too...
It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and I'd just disappear and they'd never see me again.
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
What's the matter with you, Seymour? Don't you like me? Be a man for once in your life!
You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?
I wish I could see him.
It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.
Right, exactly!
No... they said she was here...
What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
Maybe she's with Josh?
I don't know.
Did she say that?
Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues. It's really... I can't believe it.
Why don't we start with that next week?
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge.
Yes he is.
All they'll bring is more chaos and we've plenty of that already- and if they come in, word will get out- and what happens to your knighthood then?
I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived.
It was embarrassing- the man showered me with compliments.
That. I know Robert seems dreadful, but when you truly get to know the man, well, he's much worse.  And I'm one of his defenders.  Forget him for now- it's your first ride to Tsavo- I think you'll find it breathtaking. 
Just that they fart through their mouths.  Must make kissing something of a gamble.
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
And anxious to get started.  What is this, mostly malaria?
Well, why not? You seem so calm and experienced.  Why not, indeed! 
What?
Got me out of trouble.
Nonsense- Samuel would have done something. 
Let me save time-  you are the engineer;  you are in charge;  you're sorry I'm here. Right so far?  Good- because  I am not an engineer,  I don't want to be in charge, and  I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems?
It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
...don't know...
But of course yours worked.
I got big. 
I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
The most of any lions... a hundred...?  Probably more.  Johnny...?
You don't know what Tsavo means, do you?  It means "slaughter"...
I have to ask- why do you need me?
You've known him long?
Underneath.  Somewhere.
Patterson and I will be in the old hospital- where the enticing smell of sickness still lingers-  -and by the time we're done, I promise you, the odor of blood will be irresistible. 
Help finish the railroad.
No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.
If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.
I'd rather not.
I'm not saying you did.  In science we always look for the simplest explanation.
How is he these days?
Thank you.
There's no doubt about it.  He's got his father's looks.  The kid is ugly -- extremely ugly.  And smelly.  You stink!  It's just horrible.  You are the stinkiest baby I ever smelled.  What's his name?
Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.
You're really good, you know.
Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.
I don't know what to do anymore.
I'll get Ray and Egon to check out the bathtub.  You better stay here.
Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
Does she know anything about babies?
All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?
I'm not even good for me.
Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way with children.
A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped.
Oh, sure, that sounds great.
So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can finish this later if you're tired.
Okay.
Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.
You're very brave, Louis.  Good luck.
Then why have you come?
The Upper West Side.
Not.  Don't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities. We'll be back.
Oh, Johnny.  Did you back the wrong horse.
On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain, I sat on a throne of blood.  What was will be, what is will be no more.  Now is the season of evil.  Find me a child that I might live again.
So be it.  On this the day of darkness, she will be ours, wife to you and mother to me.
You've got to stop them.  Please!
Get on with it, counselor!
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
Like what?
Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get in a lot of trouble.
I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or professional reasons?
Roach breeding?  Sounds better and better.  Dana?  The boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime.  Egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge.  Should we forget about dinner and go with them instead?
I'm worried.  The vibrations could shake her to pieces.  We should have padded her feet.
Oh, hiya, Pete.
Who?
Who, Ray?
Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts.
Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --
I'll get one more reading.
It's all over the city, Pete -- well, under it actually.
It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.
Huh?  What?
Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
I don't think he's ready for the toaster.
Have I done the right thing?
Well, you're doing great.  Keep it up.
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
Definitely.  I think you may be a very gifted telepath.
Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
Barrett.  Dana Barrett.
That's a violin concerto.
No?  What do I act like?
What?
I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a degree and everything.  I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.
No kiss?
The "stiff?"  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.
Can't you tell me now?
All right.  Since you put it that way.
He is the Destructor.
Definitely some sort of fighting Spaniel, I think.
I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?
I think it's the food of the future.
Did you ever report it to anyone?
See!  They are using drugs.
On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head.  Do you remember that?
What?
What is it?
Easy ... Easy ... I'm going to throw in my trap now.
Neutronize.  System shut.
The storage facility blew.  This one ...  ... shut off the protection grid.
And look at this, Peter  Cold-riveted girders with selenium cores.
No, this one's for real, Peter.  Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings. Right off the top of the scale.  Buried the needle.  We're close this time. I can feel it.
It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
No sense worrying about it now.
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
I can't take much more of this.  The pace is killing me.
Who was the architect?
Mmmhmmm.
Me, too.
The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
I'm tired of being stuck in that wagon.
If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne.
If I may be so bold...
You're coming back?
Perhaps, Master Galen, you may say.
The dangerous man, Caesar, is the man who doesn't care.
We have to stop the Germans now!
On what charge?
How can they?  Who else is there?  I have no heir...
At least stay for the running of the animals.  You are paying for it you know...
We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.
Where is the emperor and the army, soldier?
You know there were riots last night.  Now the unrest has started again and Commodus has sent for an army division.  You understand what you are doing...
I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
You know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace.  Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years.
The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
I hope you live to see what I believe...
Fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial.
Without him.  He'd be weeping if he overheard that.  Well?  The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.
Would that Marcus had lived.
Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
Narcissus, I have your family. They're alive.  All of them.
Hidden.  Where my brother cannot place hands on them.  He didn't have the guts to watch them die so... I took care of it all.  The sooner he is put out of our misery, the sooner will they be safe.
A man should be upright, not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir.
Marcus, you honor me, but I'm a soldier, politics scare the hell out of me.
It's my job to keep my job.  And that, by the way, is now head of Praetorian Guard.  Good ole Tribuus has been retired.
The 'people'?, listen to the people, they know what they want:  A government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them with messy thoughts of issues.  You know, messy... thinking.  They want a dictator!  As far as the children, there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of:  being you! A famous gladiator!
The battle is over.  The war is over.  You've won!
Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.
Death is... everything for me.  Now you have to go to your cell, and I to dicker with Jerses... you'll be fed well.  I want you to be fit as you can be; I want you to win for me tomorrow!  I want all my gladiators to win and be happy!  Besides, I've never owned a Roman general before.
What would the poster say: "Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii Olive Oil?"
Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third!  When I get paid... just take the fall!  You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer!
It's absolutely not like that!  This is for your own good!  Come on get the rest of your armor on!
Do you know what you're going to do?
No.
No.
Why not?
But, Elaine --
Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.
All right.
Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
I'm glad.
You do?
Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
Oh my God --
Don't cry. 
-- really incredible --
Is it because I'm here?
Did you say rape her?
What did she say?
Let me go.
Because it isn't true.
All right -- but listen to me. What happened was there was this party at my parents. I drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --
-- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- I mean really naked --
My belt.
No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for.  What's this?  It's from my grandmother.
No.
I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.
What?
Will you kiss me!
But you might.
When?
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
You really will?
Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
Carl who?
The day after tomorrow?
Is the doctor anywhere?
Yes, sir.
Yes, I will.
I said -- not exactly -- no.
What are you then?
Yes.
Benjamin -- I am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion. Now if you won't do me a simple favor I don't know what.
Right.
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
A room. I'd like a room, please.
Fine, thank you. The bathroom is down at the end of the hall.
That's right.
Let's go.
Because I don't feel safe until I get the lights on.
Pardon?
What's wrong?
Like what?
Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --
Yes, I have --
Don't you think he trusts us together?
Would you like me to seduce you?
Now?
Why don't you get it.
Why don't you watch?
Benjamin, is this your first time?
Is this -- what?
Who said it was my first time?
If you want.
Are you tired of it?
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
Oh my God.
Oh.
No.
What?
You walk right out the door.
No.
Well how do you feel about him, then?
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
Was he a law student at the time?
At college.
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
How do you think.
Let's drop it.
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
Well, I'm not.
You're goddamn right I am.
Now don't start this.
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
Of course I wouldn't.
Oh no.  Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.
Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
I don't believe you.
I'll be with you in a moment, Benjamin.  Will you send a police car to twelve hundred Glenview Road. We have a burgler here. Just a second. I'll ask him.  Are you armed?  No -- I don't believe he is. Thank you.
I'd like you to know my sister, Miss DeWitte --
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Hey -- I don't get it.
Sure.
Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
What?
You don't?
About what?
Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
I've got to go.
No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --
You'll never be young again.
Ben, can I say something to you?
How long have we known each other now?
Oh no.
Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
Because I just think you two would hit it off real well together.
Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to do with me.
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
I think I've talked about this enough. I don't know how far I can go, Ben. I don't know if I can prosecute or not, but I think maybe I can. In the light of what's happened I think maybe I can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again. I have seen Elaine and I have spent the afternoon taking steps to insure...
I'd like to discuss this.
Not now.
She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
You can't.
How?
Who?
You?
Money -- Ever heard of it?
Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?
Chasing what?
Yes -- tired...
Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
That is not the truth.  You do not want to be alone -- you're afraid of being alone -- I know you're afraid. I know you. You were desperate, just now, if I go away you'll be more desperate than ever. Say I am to stay with you... say it. 
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
I don't want them now.
Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
Yes.
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
I'll go -- good-bye.
Shall I see you again?
Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.
I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.
I'll go. -- I love you.  I'll be on that train. I'll get the money.
Then you know him?
Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately.
No -- letters to two-eighty.
Most imposters are --
Oh!
Oh -- but -- I --
You're tired. I can see that.
But Doctor --
A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing...
You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
Oh, don't go.
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?
Wherever you like. Here I'll give you the money I won, three thousand four hundred. Later you can have more.
Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days.
Is the bill ready -- the lady's too?
I'm the stenographer.
Cotton Company --
Insolent young cub!
I had to arrange about the trip.
It's not funny at all. One can't get intimate just off hand. I could go to England with you and everything like that -- supposing I met you next year and I said: 'How do you do, Mr. Preysing! And you said:  'That was the young lady who was my secretary in Manchester'.
Very simple -- I've always liked the way you dressed, Preysing -- English, isn't it?
Manchester -- yes. Yes, yes, they do. Yes -- Now gentlemen shall we begin at the beginning? -- Have we cigars -- water and everything?
All right.
No water -- What a place!
Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're interested in something quite different!
Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.
Let us cancel the engagement.
Oh, Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh -- quiet.
I know -- I know -- but it will be sunny in Tremezzo. We'll have a guest then.
Last night?... There was no applause.
Again?
Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?
Me?
-- We must do something...
We must call the police, your excellency.
Did I say I wanted a cheap room to live in -- when I came here did I ask for a cheap room? Did I?
No, I won't wait -- I can't -- Every day is precious -- every hour -- Every minute.
Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
What you need is some relaxation.
What do you want with her?
I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.
You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?
He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.
You mean, the insurance frammis?
Oh, thanks, Bobo.
That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
You know it, Lilly.
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
Oh, I know, I know, and you've been wonderful since I was widowed. But Mister Hebbing has--  -- you don't mind my telling him, darling --  -- suffered reverses. If he could...
Mister Hebbing, we are talking about breaking the law here, I want to be sure you understand that. No one gets hurt, but the law does get broken.
Can't move.
You're right! And this boy tapped into that main link between Tokyo and the New York Stock Exchange. He can give us, when it's really useful, a seven second delay in that movement of information. Do you know what that means?
Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
But what's wrong?
You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
Oh, sure. Fine.
Fair enough.
What are you talking about? So I've got a job. So what?
You do if you're where I am. Where you want to be. How'd you get that punch in the stomach, Roy?
Get off the grift, Roy.
No. That was the point.
Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash?
As though you do what I say.
I'll get it.
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age?
Oh, that's it! You're stealing my money for my own good! How very motherly of you, Lilly.
All? It ain't bad.
No more than this?
I just do what the doctor says, babe.
Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you.
Oh, don't be stupid.
I'll sign that affidavit.
You already went back to work.
Is that right?
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us.
What?
That's what I say.
No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
Broken blood vessels on her right forearm.
It's Blake.  Meet me at Grand View.
Sweet dreams, Blake.
It's Blake.  How do you feel about Wisconsin?
Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
... I think it would be best if you both left.
Funny, we just drove right in.
It's Amy Kramer.
No shit?!
No.  Wait for the police.
Nothing's missing?
I thought you'd never ask.
Afraid not.  You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.
Why didn't you tell me?
I came to see you.
Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
Bye Will.
What are you looking at?
The serial killer?
Never.
Can't it wait till Monday?  I thought maybe we could dance...  I'm very light of my feet.
Reality check, dillweed.  This is 1995.
The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
He says things.  Bad things.
I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me.
This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.
It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew she would one day.  And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well.
That's what someone wants us to believe, but I tell you Michael is alive.  I feel him.  I sense the evil that lives inside, just as I did all those years as I watched him.  Sitting behind these very same walls.  Staring. Growing stronger.  As my colleague, as my friend, please. I can't go through this again.  Not alone.  I need your help to stop him.
This is madness, Wynn.
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
And I'm its deliverer.  Its calling card, if you will.  I follow it.  Protect it. Act as its guardian.  In a sense, Sam, so do you.
I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But I know. I've always known.
I dunno, boy.
We'll see.
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy.  You come home, and nobody's here.  When I go home, everybody's going to be there.
Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.
I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
You know what gets me about that Cadillac?
That's the point!  Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up.
Let's talk about it some other time.
Months?
How about breakfast, wife?
She was about to get married again. She locked me out of the bedroom last night.
Shut up, you ninny!  You were never to come here again-- for any reason whatsoever!
In what way, pray tell?
Maybe it's time you got out.
The posies are for her?
I wanted to apologize.
You've come to the right man.
I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
Blue soup.
It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
To make an ass of yourself.
Thank God!
The doctor was called away on an emergency.  I think it was birth.
He insults him all the time.
He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother.  You know what he called Father one time?
"Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy."
Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
Tell me some true stories about Dad.
Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis.
Uck.
When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
You're supposed to get hurt!
Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
Sir?
I can't take my eyes off you.
Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
Penelope!
She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they got her.
Scat!
It's Mom.
Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
Too late!  It's man to man now. Protecting your mother from me, are you?  Protect her!`
Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
Not at all.
A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
I'm not about to introduce to you a jungle novelty.  What I have in mind is massage--a perfectly decent massage.  Turn around, turn around.
You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.
We all do.  But now it's body time. Relax.  Ideally, the body of a woman should feel like a hot water bottle filled with Devonshire cream. You feel like a paper bag crammed with curtain rods.  Think of your muscles one by one.  Let them go slack.  Relax.  Let the brain go blank.  Relax.  That's the idea-- that's my girl.  Now the small of the back.  Let those knots over those kidneys unsnarl.
You're a woman, aren't you?
Don't lecture me on race relations. I don't have a molecule of prejudice.  I've been in battle with every kind of man there is. I've been in bed with every kind of woman there is--from a Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian. If I'd ever been to the South Pole, there'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me.  Cook!
This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.
That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.
If he wants to go.
Did you like it, dear?
He knows you shattered his violin.
Hope.
Beautiful, you say?  It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything!  Beautiful?  Seven years gone--  like that, like that!  Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!
Action!  Interaction!  Give and take!  Challenge and response!
If he thinks he's man enough.
I'm teaching my son to be a man.
You hope this, too?
Ah!  The lady is armed.
Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
Out!
You've killed women?
Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.
...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.
Oh dear.
She still has just the one child-- the boy?
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
Would you say that again?
Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
What for?
Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
I hate crowds, and I have no charisma--
Was I ever of use?
I'm going to shoot you now.
Thank God. HAROLD Crawl home.
It's trash now, like mine.
What are you going to do?
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
So that's it! "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." Everybody was yelling "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." I thought it was some foreign language.
Alice is dead?
No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope.
That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
Something's made you sore.
Don't worry about it.
What's this?
Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing.  Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl?
Everybody talks about how rotten kids act.  Grownups can be pretty rotten, too.
I know.
He's alive!
Still lives with his mother.
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
Anywhere but here.  I'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten.
No.
For Heaven's sakes!
Okay.
I don't want to go to Vanderbilt.
If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.
Beautiful!  I've never seen that coat.
He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
The park!
I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
A what?
How long has this been going on?
Paul's only twelve years old.
Is that a fact?
Or get eaten alive.
Phooey.
I'm sick of this argument.  I just have one more thing to say: If you elect a President, you support him, no matter what he does.  That's the only way you can have a country!
You're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of Dubuque?  Take care of your body, yes!  But don't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes.  Don't become obsessed by your musculature.  Any one of these poor, dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be. Their magic was in their muscles. Your magic is in your brains!
What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
That you may discuss with the girl of your choice in the privacy of your room.
You sure? We have regular sessions, too. Only twenty dollars?
I said I hope she's a runaway. Better that than she just disappears like so many others do. Sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. These are realities.
No, I don't.
I have to ask you that. If you were Vice you couldn't deny it. You ought to dress less square. You wouldn't get hassled so much. Here, let me help you get that tie off.
Pull out your cock.
What?
Are you going to stiff me?
...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.
I don't know no Tod.
Yeah.
Are you sure it's all right?
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
Got any parts? I'm free. Not free- free, but, you know, free. I don't really do this.
Do you know where she lives?
You won't keep growing at this rate.
Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?
Okay, tell me. Why do you live like you do?
No. But does it make any difference?  How did you get to be the way you are?
How important do you think sex is?
Out of gratitude for being chosen. That's where Grace comes in. God first chooses you, then allows you, by Grace, to choose Him of your own free will.
What makes you so sure?
Yeah.  She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville.
What happened?
But then you'll forget about me.
Andy.
Hey, I'm a private detective, Van Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them.
Who's paying you?
Hmm.
I don't know.
Get out!
Yeah, sure.
Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into.
I'm sorry about that. Have you found anything out? You've got to tell me.
How did you find me?
What is going on?
What will I tell the others? They care about you.
Tell them anything you want. Tell them I'm on a vacation, a business trip. Tell them I needed a rest. Tell them anything, just don't tell them...
That's not true, Mr...?
Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.
Where is she? Where is the girl?
Look, I know this chick Niki. She works at Les Girls. She would know. Honest.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Ratan!
I don't know nothing, man.
I thought I'd invest in a film. I want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done...
It's an investment.
...I'd just start my own business. That's what I did. Get into kid porn. That's big now. Why don't you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I'll ask around.
I don't know.
Com'on, tell me.
I'm worried about Jake.
I'm off that case. He fired me.
He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
I'll tell you, that was an interesting case. The Van Dorn girl. I've handled runaway cases like it before. Usually when you put the pressure on the porn underworld for an underage kid, she pops up in about a week. Everybody denies ever seeing her, but there she is at the airport with a prepaid ticket home. Well, I put pressure on all over town for this girl and it stayed cold as ice. In fact, certain people for this girl and -- nothing.  I guess I gave your brother-in-law sort of a raw deal.
You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.
You working in San Diego now?
Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
How long have you been driving?
Could I see your registration?
Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
Is this your shovel?
Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
She supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed.
Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
Oh, thank you. I think we shall be great friends, don't you?
Well, then, you must come back and visit.
That's a nice teapot.
Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals.  Of course, the age has its advantages.
An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
Oh, it's all right. It's organic.
My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
Why? There'll be a new block of ice in the morning.
Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars are shining right now. We just can't see them. Just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.
With God?
Well, don't go.
Really. Just put it there, Harold.
I don't know. Perhaps.
You should have been a poet.
Maude.
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
For you.
Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
But you're not going anywhere, are you?
But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me.
Can't complain.
Oh, he's in the Army. I do so like the military, don't you? Those uniforms make men look so virile. I did "What Price Glory?" in summer stock. I played Charmaine - with a French accent.
And why is that?
Yes. It does.
I put a lot of effort into these things.
Ah, yes.
And a lot of time.
My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
I don't know.
I go to funerals.
Huh?
You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?
Your classmates?
You think so, sir?
Sure. Be able to tell your children. Something for them to look up to. Be proud of.
It's the greatest excitement in the world.
The moment of truth.
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
'Fraid not, baby. He belongs here. With me. We're the same. Brothers. Equal and opposite. Pure appetite. Pure banality. Too much feeling. None at all.
I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.
You a doctor, too?
I know. No-one can. But I have to save him. Where's the other doctor? He said He'd listen. He promised.
You were ALL human!
Steve...
What are you talking about? Who are you?
Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
I abhor violence.  Sergeant Whitman, I hope you don't think me mad --
Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
Reliquary --
A prison. The Vatican deemed its contents dangerous enough to include it on the List of Avignon. Of which we hold a copy.
"In the absence of light, darkness prevails." For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.
Got tired of me?
It is. You got yourself on TV again.
Grounded? Who's grounded?
Noooo! Noooo!!!
I knew those men better than you did --
Each of us gets a belt.
Those comics -- They never got the eyes right.
No one ever helps me. It's my job.
What are you, a Boy Scout?
No. I never was.
Could've fooled me. Go away.
I think I can help -- Talk to her -- I can bring her back.
Shh! Just a second.
Not from you.
No. Myers is taking me.
No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
Coffee's warming me up.
Uh-huh.
Lucky man.
It's just a puzzle box.
I have to speak to my father.
Come to Daddy.
This isn't happening.
That's right. Who are you?
I'm very happy.
Tell me who you are.
Frank.
What?
You would be. They tore me apart.
I don't.
Then find me somebody else, before they come looking.
Maybe.
Sure.
Where's Daddy?
Of course. There's no need to shout.
I was here this afternoon.
We're going to freeze to death.
It's just been empty a while.
I thought half of it was your brother's?
No argument.
I hear you.
It looks like a bomb's dropped.
You're NOT going to faint.
You're done worse.
What's wrong with you?
It's better you see for yourself --
I got through.
You'd like the house.
Of course. Every day.
Yeah.
I love you, honey.
I love you too.
Of course.
Yes!
Meaning what?
It's not what I heard.
What things?
You gotta be kidding me.
We'll do it next Monday.
Well what's the point in that?
Oh, now you're defending that motherfucker?  You're going soft in your old age, Rob.  There was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street.  Now all of a sudden I'm offending your golf buddy.  You're right, Rob.  I am so sorry. How are we ever going to make enough money to get you and Laura into the country club?
It's not my car, now is it?  It's Laura's car, and thus Laura has it. So it's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab. Wow.  Fucking great.
I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
What am I missing?  What do you have to be happy about?
I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here.  I don't understand any part of this conversation.  You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen.  What am I supposed to say?
Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
Suck my ass.
Fuck off, Barry.
Because it's in The Big Chill.
I heard you, man.  Don't give me that "what" shit.  You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them.
So?  You even said they're good.
HELLO.  DO YOU SEE ANYONE ELSE around here with a band, Mr. Branson?  Mr. Phil Spector?
Barry, you're over thirty years old. You owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey.
I have a television.
No.  The Righteous Brothers.
Nothing.
We work there!
He's not worth it!
No.  No.  Mom wants you to come to the funeral.  It's on Friday.
Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary.  That's all.
Right.  Why?
So.  Is now a good time?
Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
Can I go home and work this out and let you know?  In a week or so?
Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --
Yeah.
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?  Why don't I just make you a tape?
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
Well, I'll just make it for you.
Yeah.
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
Nothing to resolve, Ian.  Let's get a drink.
Are you coming home?
My house?
Well, I liked you.  You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one.
Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.
Just ask it!
You really think it would make a difference either way?
I haven't felt like it.
I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
I don't have your number.
I'm not -- hold on...
Mmm hmm.
I can't talk right now.
I don't care.  As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
Uh... No.
Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate.
No, but...
But what?
I tricked you into meeting some people you'd think were great.  I thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a Tina Turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way.
WHAT?
Very persuasive.
Are you persuadable?
So?
How're you holding up?
Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, "you know what?  Maybe it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." You know?
Isn't that how it is for everybody?
It's a great song.
I understand completely.
And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
How's the store?
I'm Vince.
Nice.
How old is Richard?
Uncle Joey's little girl.  Can't get the taste out of her mouth.
Sure.
Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.
Happy birthday.
Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.
Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
Carl Smith.
It's not mine.
Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-
I doubt that.  Good day, Miss Cartwright.
Where?
You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time.
I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
You want me to front for you.
The less exposure I recieve around government buildings the better.  You, as Mrs. Taupin, will attract considerably less attention than I.
I see.
Just a little crazy.
Yes.
He is older than I.
Damn you.
You have lived forever.
Now there's a new topic.
Thanks.
I'll take care of that Corey, but I need this now.
You always were hard to impress.
-Luceat ei-
Stop.
I am from Spain.  And I would like a moment of your time.
Please go to no trouble.
And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.
But we cannot be killed.
Muy Bien!
No doubt.
They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
Second musketeer.
We have no understanding.
You are really going to force this, aren't you?
We learned he'd found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York.  Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill...
Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent.
Of sorts.
MACLEOD!
Tradition.
Go to hell.
A double guard's been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings, railroad terminals, and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution.
Sort of a Jack London style?
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
It will be perfectly all right, Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train.
Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.
But --
All right.  One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey.
You got it back, eh? There's something funny going on around here.
I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin!
But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
That's right. -- Rubbers, too, I hope? A man ought to be prepared for any emergency.
Taking the train today -- and being married tomorrow?
Just for the first year.
That'll be nice. A home with mother. A real honeymoon. In Albany, too. Ow!
Yes, I know...  Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town...
Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure I'm in one line of business that really helps people. Of course, we don't help you much when you're alive -- but afterward -- that's what counts.
But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep going! Sorry, Bruce, but --
If she's not there, mother and I are leaving anyhow!
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
That's the kind of stuff they want!
Say, I want to be sure, too!
We'll just start by impounding the Post property.  Is that your desk?
Out of the mouths of babes.
I notice you still remember it.
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
Just what I said. That's what I --
Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
Look at this! 
I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
Say, could I meet him?
Now you got me.
Thanks.
His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.  I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
Hold on a minute.
She jumped out of the window.
Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? Hildy, this is war! You can't desert now!
We'll lower it out of the window with pulleys. Quit stallin'.
Finished!
Was she? Did you notice?
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now!
Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look --
Who did you talk to?
Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.
We've certainly been in some swell jams.
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
I don't know what to do, Walter.
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
What would you do if it was a daughter?
Now don't argue, Hildy.  How about it, Judge?
You're not fooling anybody.
Walter, you can't do that!
It'll be Heaven!
Western an' Thirty-fourth.
Who do you want?
I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
I think it is.
Just a second, Mike ---  Mollie, I got it!
What have you got, Hildy?
Who's this guy she's gonna marry?
Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
I can't complain.
Good coffee, isn't it?
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
Not this gun!
Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
What went off?
Yeah. But I --
Twelve dollars! -- For those rheumatic uncles of yours?  Out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it?
Fred!
And you can tell 'em as an afterthought that I want your resignation now!
Shoot to kill, I said.
Hello, Olsen... Listen...  Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there.  Well, I hope that's the right thing to do.
If we didn't have election Tuesday I'd have this on my conscience.
Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?
Now, Hildy --
Phone for you, Hildy.
But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
First you got to sign a receipt. 
Some Hallowe'en goin' on outside. The whole police force standing on it's ear.
I'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. There's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense.
It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
Keep away!
Get the Governor on the phone!
How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus, and as long as I am Mayor --
She and Mollie were talking.
You'll be at home for the weekends. Now shut up, or walk.
Who told you that?
Would.
He's the worst liar.
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
Well, for the baby, really.
That's it. When you tell a lie, you hope to get away with it. When someone else does, you want to find them out. A good batsman will spot a googly. A good bowler will hide it. Always remember that, son.
Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have.
Did you? You thought you did. We've been gypsed, all our lives. Look at your street.
Never done better. On the fiddle. Like everyone else.
We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.
Or what?
Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
Really, wow, so it's really a real thing.
Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate?
Any cone, yeah...  I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either.
I know I hate Swiss cheese, the holes make me nervous.
Things like that get a lot bloodier than ya think.
Where's that?
If you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate... it's easier.
Well, yeah, kind of.
A dead one.
Mmmmm, this is tasty.
What? No, I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long.
Yeah, I'll do something.
Ummmm... two hundred and eighty-five dollars.
Holy crap, thanks!
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
Yeah, I fixed it. Well, I ain't... um, I can't remember. I think I took it out to fit the bags and forgot to put it back.
Well, technically I did what ya said.
Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
Tasted pretty good.
Yeah, showtime for what?
It's a girl.
We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.
There's a dog in the road.
Don't worry, I'll be quick. Just stay here, no sense everybody getting drenched.
Whatever it is just do it. The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here.
What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going?
Enough talk, write.
Can I get some stamps off ya?  Did you fix the toilet yet?
He should be back in a couple hours.
Oh.
Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
So what?
When you were outside with Bill.
Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up.
I resign.
Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
Exactly... well, I guess a couple more photos won't kill me.
I can't believe...
Recover any bodies?
Keys.
Yes, sir.
I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
Oh, you mean on TV.
Oh, it's real... as real as I want it to be, mamma...  ...look, see the magic in my brush strokes.
Right.
Your Spidey senses tingling.
Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
You're fucked up, Lila.  Why don't you fucking try electrolysis or something? Figure it out for chrissake.
Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off.
No. Don't be silly. It's just...
I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
But I don't know how to leave Lila.
You think too much. I need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than he thinks... is what I need!
What?
No!
Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.
That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous.
We still have you and I.
Okay, my sweet. Good night.
No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.
Tell me. I could use someone up my alley.
Yeah. Says he likes you even more than he likes his own mother. And according to my brother Nathan's abormally close with his mother.
Stand on a stepladder sometimes.
Let's get you out of here. Come stay with me until you get your strength back.  Free electrolysis, if you want it! We'll get that face of yours cleared up in no time.
Shut up, you.
I'm really glad you two found each other.
You've got to respect that.
Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond.
No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.
No biggie.
I don't think so.  Why?
We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny."  Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.
I don't know. Something.
No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.
If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person.  Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that.
Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of reality.
Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!
Really? Wow! That's that's terrific to hear from someone so... feminine, so female.
I'm just preoccupied.
Oh yes, baby! I think that this is a wonderful project you're doing, taking this poor unfortunate, uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being! What a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are!
That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
Don't worry, Lila. You can stay. I don't have any interest in you anymore.  C'mon, monkey boy.
Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. I don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case.
Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance.
Now, my diminutive friend, what can I do for you?
What do you guys sell?
And a fact is a fact.
For whom and for what?
It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money.
All I want's the money.
Sure, sure, just the money, and the aristocratic pleasure of seeing him fall apart. You're a Roman, Bert. You have to win them all.
Good, good.
I didn't ask him can he beat you. I already know he can beat you. I asked him will he? With Eddie, that's two different things.
How much do I owe you?
Two.
Character.
That's your problem.
What's that supposed to mean?
Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.
Thanks for the drink.
Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
Look, you wanna hustle pool, don't you? This game isn't like football. Nobody pays you for yardage. When you hustle you keep score real simple. The end of the game you count up your money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only way.
What happened to you anyway?
Hey, get us a couple of drinks here, will ya? J. T. S. Brown.
How're the hands?
Well, rack up your cue. We're leavin'.
Tell her what?
And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was.
Up the flagpole with the convention. C'mon, Charlie. You're into me now. I got my money on the table.
Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
You don't need a drink.
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
Yeah, to play Fats again.
You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat.
Hey, you're Eddie Felson, aren't you?
Couple of bucks.
How long have you been waiting?
Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?
What did you say that for, Sarah?
Sarah.  Eddie, look. I've got troubles, and I think maybe you've got troubles. Maybe it'd be better if we just leave each other alone.
I'm not sure... I don't know.
Yeah, I went out for a couple of hours.
You got it all in your head?
Oh, it's not bad.
No, stick around.  Can I get you something? Drink? Coffee?
You wanna drink?
What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
Sure. Let's go home.
Well, what's the matter?
Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
Where do you come from?
California? Is your name Felson? Eddie Felson?
Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass.
Preacher, gimme my coat, will ya?
So do you, Fast Eddie.
You lived like this once.
Do you want to go on?
Dark and large.  With vines -- no, not vines.  Not alive.
I only protect myself -- !
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
Yes.
Only got one kind.
You'll meet new friends.  I know ... it's rough.  But I have to move, son.
That's the Air Force Base.
It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
Okay.
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
I'll go take a look when the rain lets off.
It was all made of stuff that's happened to you in the last few days.  The sand pit in back of the house, and the meteor shower, and meeting your teacher and the colonel at school, and being afraid of the new kids because you don't know them ...
I will.  But isn't that odd -- about my dream ... ?
I left it at work.
I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
I don't see anything.
Hide the car.
I know a way.
This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
What's his family background?
Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call.
If we do, we'll both die virgins. But at last we'll be together.
Walk to the window. Right in front of you.
Punched the President? Oh my god.
I could have evacuated the cities hours ago.  You know, when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. It's not simple anymore, Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to?
Then get them out of there.
We've tried. It's not working. It's almost as though they weren't even there.
That's the good news?
A countdown to what?
Think. It's like in chess. First you strategically position your pieces. Then, when the timing's right. You strike.
I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers.
Can't this thing go any faster?
You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
She didn't take my name when we were married.
You can do that?
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
You as well.
But Mr. President...
We're being exterminated.
Then find them.
Roger, Eagle One, our primary target has shifted course.
We're trying to communicate with them on all frequencies but we're getting nowhere. Atlantic Command is working on a type of visual communication.
It's doing what?
Yeah, but what an entrance!
He's my angel.
Really? Ballet?
Oh. Sorry.
Didn't want to say anything. I voted for the other guy.
How to kiss ass.
Just take it, dick head.  Alicia! Make sure he takes his medicine.
It's the wrong field, you idiot! Lucas' farm is on the other side of town.
Damn it, he was doing you a favor. You know how hard it is to find someone who doesn't think you're completely crazy? What are we supposed to do now? Huh? Where are we supposed to go now?
We should leave too.
You are on your own?
You've got it!
Well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don't know what they mean.
Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.
The Name of God...
You're meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend.
Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
An old man's dream.
Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Doctor Jones?
Yes?
I usually don't.
Are you sure?
Pretty sure.
You said go between them!
Don't know. Think of something.
How do you know?
It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
Then wait -- count to twenty.
Don't call me that, please.
Dad, they come in through the doors.
He was actually there? You saw him?
Alexandretta.  It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.
Well, uh...
Will you take it easy!
Don't worry. He won't.
Umh?
The floor's on fire! See?!
Dad!
What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
My Diary's in Berlin.
Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
Relax.
Very well. I'm here now.
The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
Junior?! Dad...
After you, Junior.
Come on -- come on!
They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.
My name is Kazim.
No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta.
Something magical. A sacred rock.
What?
You should have been there...
A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
I don't like to show off.
Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
At last I have the ashes of my sacred ancestor!
Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?
No. They are here -- somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs.
That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
What evil?
Long ago -- before my father's father.
Siam.
Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
What?!
Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.
Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years.  Fortune and glory...
Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
You're talking to an authority in that area.
You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door.
Please -- oh please, I'm going to die! Get it off!
Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!
It's a Thuggee ceremony. They're worshipping Kali, the goddess of Death and Destruction.
Quiet!
I want to go home...
Yes, they believe you.
There's got to be another way out.
You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
Who?
Yes.
What is your name?
You're in my head? You don't know my name?
Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.
What street?! We're walking down QUEER STREET. We coming to Dopey Drive. We're about to be put somewhere quiet where they won't mind that we talk to ourselves.
...I need to make a phone call.
You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything.
Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
Me? What'd I do?
I just went there for a job.
Kill myself.
Are you crazy?
Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.
Then I'm crazy.
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
I'll tell you what to say.
I don't know. I don't want to find out.
Yeah...Who is?
What does it say.
Gone where?
Nothing!
Composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique...
Who?...  Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone.
What about it?
The beach?
How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
Eating sushi?
The sand.
Where are you going? Wait!
Follow it.
How should I know?
Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
Don't get too cute.
How do you know?
Come on...look at her. Don't you know anything about women?... The data is skewed. We might as well go with instinct...
You're doing great with her.
You can't listen. You can't watch either.
What if she says something important?
I don't know!
No. What will you do.
Fountainhead of High-Tech.
You think. That's what you're good at.
I told you, I have a feeling...
Never mind, just say it.
Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
He must not know. GRUNER just made the switch back.
He didn't. He left us that walkman chip to confuse us. Would have kept most people busy. We were too fast for him.
I can't handle that thing.
Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.
Aim what?
What exactly?
I don't know.
You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
I mean it!  No one else would have helped. I take it all back, everything I've said about you.
Don't worry about me. You take this time for your own, you two.....
I came for a rest. As, I imagine, you did. To get away with it all.
Oh...that's okay.
Right.
Well what?
Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
Oh yeah, thanks...
No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
Why would we want to hurt you?
I don't know Who.
Not...complaining, actually.
Much better now, thank you. Just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon...
Sir?
Yessir...very good sir.
No. No one to speak of.
Haven't seen you around.
Me still. They left you alone?
Why?
...Naw. Made that up.
Trans Ocean Travel.
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
They left. I had to go with them.
No.
Now, so am I...What's so interesting about him?
Got to trust someone.
Get your things.
Who was?
Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
Hong Kong.
Dieter's gone to shoot a still job. Hong Kong.
I said just relax. I'm in full control.
Can't you do something?
Why did you, then?
Why are you on to him?
We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
Leaving, now go to sleep. ...all of you.
It'l be alright.
Too much.
Instant rice...?
Can I go over to Janeane's house?
Lowell?
I'll take a look at what you got. But I'm not moving any deadlines 'cause you say so.
No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." I hear... "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse." I hear... "Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!" That's what I hear.
You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
End up in a high-profile lawsuit with Lowell, the First Amendment martyr? I don't think so.  Take a look at this... This is a summary of a dossier that's being prepared.
I'm afraid you are.
Are you sure?
And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
Come again?
Is this "Alice in Wonderland"?
Call me back in ten.
Don't you have to be at the office?
Is there any more rice...?
My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --
Yeah.
They're killing the Wigand interview...
Jeffrey...
Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.
...you fucked me!
Area code 212-555-0199.
It would be better if he called us.
Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
Who are these people?
Do me a favor, will you? Spare me, for God's sake. Get in the real world. What do you think? I'm going to resign in protest? To force it on the air? The answer is "no." I don't plan to spend the end of my days wandering in the wilderness of National Public Radio.  That decision I've already made.
Yeah, that's right.
Give me a break!
You and I have been doing this together for fourteen years.
No. We don't do that.  You've seen "60 Minutes" and Mike Wallace. So you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity. You also know we are the highest-rated, most-respected, TV-magazine news show in America.
So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me?
You okay?
I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
No.
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
Jeff...
...they "volunteered." A friend owns a large security company.
Did you have a good day?
No. I mean since whenever...
What?
Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview... where you're saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics...?
ABC...?
ABC Telemarketing Company.
Jeffrey, where you going with this? So where you goin'?  You are important to a lot of people, Jeffrey. You think about that. You think about them.
Hello, can you hear me now?
Alright, now listen to me. I want you -- I want you to tell him, in these words: get on the fucking phone...!
The process is known as "impact boosting..." While not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it. There's extensive use of this technology, know as "ammonia chemistry." It allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system.
And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
Chapter and verse.
Okay.  I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh.
She makes felt wallets. Got one right here.
Grounds?
We rest, Your Honor.
Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
You want Botox?
It was a gift from a client.
Set one side for Bel Air.
Well... I'm still...
I already made my move, Kenneth.
So, that's good, right?
Why do you think she did it?
Oh boy. If he only knew.
Yeah. I guess. You know --
Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down.
Why would you be here?
He wants a reconciliation.
Gotcha.
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
I am thrilled for you, but tell me this... How'd you get Howard to do it? I've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion, but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea.
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
You really think I engineered the whole thing. You think the marriage and the divorce was part of some scheme. You came here to celebrate because you think I'm without morality or soul. You --  sound like my mother.
Marylin? When did I say...?
Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --
Apparently she was very disappointed.
No, we're not!
Yes.
I have a watch.
No. Stay. I want you close to me. This couch is wrong. It's not a "married couch."
Miles? You're scaring me.
I don't know. Maybe I should grab my mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have little experience with "the criminal mind."
On the contrary. We're married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine.
I want to nail you ass.
What kind of "stuff?"
Those are gifts.
Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.
Marylin!
It's okay Joe.
Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...
Forgery? Fraud?
Murder?
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
Do you know him?
I wish I had your discipline.
Hello Miles.
My client has ruled that out.
My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
Heh heh.
Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe we're being too conservative. Seventy five percent.
He never ate the pre-nup, did he!
I don't have a pre-nup
Thank you.
Now Rex.
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
I'm not sure.
Video.
Sorry.
No. You're not.
Miles -- why so angry?
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
Three is not Farrow.
I've put extra men on, all along the way.
I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her. 
How is she?
Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
You were taken for a buggy ride?
Yes!  But don't hold that against me. I'm a little screwy myself.
Why don't you put me in chains?
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
Stunt?
Yes. I know. Well, you can help now. I issued a statement yesterday that I've withdrawn my objections. Begging her to come home. I haven't heard from her. Apparently she doesn't trust me.
You talk as if
Someday perhaps, you might even take charge.
Yes, sir.
Personally, I think it's stupid!  But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object.
Any others?
Amateurs!
All right, let it go.
Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
You win!
That cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run!
What are you talking about?
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
That's none of your business.
Shut up!
Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but you've been very kind. 
All right, don't join the Israelites. Perhaps you're interested in how a man undresses.  Funny thing about that. Quite a study in psychology. No two men do it alike. 
You've got a name, haven't you?
Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
Like this. I have no robe.
Yeah?
Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
Thanks, professor.
I'm sorry I didn't take another sock at him.
After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
If you don't like it, you can resign from the company.
What's the matter?
Not as long as I'm alive.
You didn't give that boy all your money?
Of course it is.
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride
Yes.
Holy Smokes! Why did I ever get mixed up with you!
Here. Eat your head off.
Thought you were hungry!
But what!
Yeah. I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy.
You figured that all out yourself, huh?
Amazing.
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
If you do, I'll break your neck.
Come here, you little fool!
In about fifteen minutes.
Husband?
You ain't gonna stick me for no phone calls. You can go down to the Sheriff's office.
That's pretty good . . . Well, shut my big nasty mouth!
Oh, excuse me. 
Yeah.
Don't accept any more.
That was free verse, you gashouse palooka!
Don't "Joe" me.
I'd put you there myself.
ain't got a hat
Yeah.
That feller last night, that's who! He was gonna stay a week, huh? Well, he's skipped. Took the car with him, too. We wouldn't have known a thing about it until morning if I hadn't took that magnesia.  Come on, get up, don't lay there. Let's do something about it.
Yeah, you'll have to git .
Wife?
Yeah. Come oncome on!
Oh, excuse me.  I was just tryin'you knowto make things pleasant.
That's right.
It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame, you know what I'd do?
No.
Not one word.  That's an order.
Without them, it's going to be near impossible, chief, to prove Shaw's connection to the CIA.  We got the same problem with the governors. All of them.  Reagan in California won't give us Brading, Ohio refuses Orville Townsend, Texas on Arcacha, and Nebraska on Sandra Moffet.
I've seen him copying files, leaving here late at night.
You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?
You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
Mario, Jose - they wear names like you and I wear clothes.  Today the name is Candy, tomorrow it's Butsie. I wish I could help you, Jim.
Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember.  Stick to what you can prove in court.
Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
Keep saying what?
To frame him, obviously.  You got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think, Bill!  They're not ordinary crooks.
That's gonna be tough.  Nobody's talking.
Why?
Well, you see, I've been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since 1948, when I was in Korea...
I don't know who to trust anymore. Yeah, sure I could use a pot of hot coffee and a few packs of Camels. You got anything new in the investigation?
That's not true.  I never met anybody named Oswald.  Anybody who told you that has to be crazy.
Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
But the boys told us they didn't get any.
Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car.  Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?
Dave, can I just ask you this directly?  Did you ever work for the CIA?
Oh man, why don't you stop.  This is too fuckin' big for you!  Who did Kennedy?  It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma.  Even the shooters don't fuckin' know!  Don't you get it yet?  I can't be talking like this.  They're gonna kill me. I'm gonna die!  I don't know what happened.  All I wanted in the world was to be a Catholic priest - live in a monastery, study ancient Latin manuscripts, pray, serve God.  But I had this one terrible, fatal weakness.  They defrocked me.  And then I started to lose everything.
No.
No, because there were others.  There were admirals.
What?
I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the jury.
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
None either.  It's bizarre.  It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out.  Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63.  A man who has defected once already.  It's crazy.
Of course not!  Such a pity, that assassination.  In fact, I admired President Kennedy.  A man with true panache, and a wife with impeccable taste.
...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...
I've spent half my life in the United States military serving and defending this great country, Mr. Shaw, and you're the first person I ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president.
Yes, it was about 11 in the morning. I was driving west on Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass, in a rented car - a blue Valiant.  I'll never forget that day.
Come on now, we'll talk about it at the table, dinner's getting cold.  What are you doing in here?
Don't be.  Nothing to be scared about, honey, I been through four years of war - this is nothing.
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
I'm leaving.  I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving!  I won't stand it anymore.
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
There was Rose Cheramie.  A whore. Two Cubans threw her out of a car on the way to Dallas.
Graveyard dead near Big Sandy, Texas in '65.  Two in the morning on some highway.  A hit and run.
Didn't Hoover say something about that?  The leaves had fallen off in November?
That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.
Well, if that's what you want to call it.  I didn't ever think it would come to this.  I guess I am, boss.
I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.
Just think... just think.  What happened to our country .. to the world...  because of that murder... Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier...
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
You have other information?
Was he there often?
Often?  He practically lived there. It was real cloak and dagger stuff. They called it Operation Mongoose. The idea was to train all these Cuban exiles for another invasion of Cuba. Banister's office was part of a supply line that ran from Dallas, through New Orleans to Miami, stockpiling arms and explosives.
Anything more specific, Jack?  It's important.
The assassination, Jack?
Hold on, Jack.  What's the problem?
I expected that two months ago, and they're wasting their time... The bad news is the National Guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years.  Well, maybe that's good news - it was never as good as combat, but this is.  Bill, any more on Oswald and Shaw?
That's all you've had all this time?
What are they?
Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
Not a problem.
I know. That's why I went.
You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him.
Ever heard of a fella named Beaumont Livingston?
She wants to make a deal.
Arrest me.
Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were flying for TWA and got busted for carrying drugs. You were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours. He did time and you got off. But that ended your career with the big airlines. Cut to thirteen years later. You're forty-four years of age. You're flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fucking piece of shit Mexican airline that there is. Where you make a whopping twelve-thousand dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva lot to show for a twenty year career. And to top it off, you're going to jail. Now true, the judge, even with your prior, will probably only give you a year or two. But this doesn't seem like the time of life you got years to throw away.  Now, we don't like trying losers like they're criminals. But in the absence of a criminal, we will try you. Now, wasn't this money given to you by an American living in Mexico by the name of Cedric Walker?
What's in it?
Take your time.
Thanks.
Help you get Ordell Robbie.
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me.
Was she helpful?
But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation.  How 'bout another?
I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me.
The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
If you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law, why not pack a hundred grand?
But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.
'74, I think.
Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it.
How'd you feel about it?
It's different with men.
I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?
What'd ya see?
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
For now. These relationships never last too long.
How old's Annette?
I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
I believe I said I'd be tempted.
That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.
We're partners.
Sure I can't twist your arm?
You planted that shit on me.
If I'm working, I can help you.
Then how do you know he sells guns?
Not yet.
What did you say?
I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
Uh-huh.
She didn't say.
Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?
Yes. All those things are true.
That would be one point of view.
She didn't give me one. I told you before, Melanie wasn't part of the plan. Ordell must of told her to do it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping bag, and takes off. What am I supposed to do, go after her? I'm in my fucking underwear. I had to get dressed before I could do anything. So I put this back on 'cause could put this on faster than I could my uniform.
There was a guy with Melanie?
I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
We pick up Ordell. We've got three murders we can link him to. We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. And we have you.
Great...  ...Wanda!
Better get me another Sam's.  Join me in a Jaeger shot?
Uh-uh.
Beaumont Livingston?
Kinda.
What's that fucker ever done for us?
I don't think so, but thanks for the beer.
Thanks.
I was expecting you. Come in.
Who you think got your ass outta jail?
Hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business.
They asked.
I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
All your money's in Mexico.
It's true, isn't it?
Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money.
A woman.
No, I give it to someone else first.
Managers get ten percent.
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
I'll give ya ten.
I can do that.
Uh-huh.
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
Designer clothes.
I'm impressed. He knows a lot.
How long?
Two months shy of four years.
Really, I'm impressed.
It's a diet thing?
Okay, Lou-is.
What's your cost?
You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go "bleep." That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
Now play the volume as loud as you want but don't touch my levels. I got them set just the way I want 'em.
Guess where I am?
She believed you?
You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute.'
Melanie must be dyin' to see it.  Louis.
Couldn't talk to her?
Uh-huh.
Where did you shoot her?
What?
Where's the rest of it?
Came outta where?
Where you shot her.
If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
You know who I saw in the dress department?
Max Cherry.
Hell, yes, they know each other. He bonded her out of county.
Have fun.
Where would you like me to put my ash?
Do you know what he's on probation for?
Ordell Robbie. O-R-D-E-L-L. R-O-B-B- I-E. 1436 Florence Boulevard. Compton 90222.
Oh, yeah? What did he do?
She is an airline stewardess. Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow. They set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what I was thinkin', you could use the ten thousand you owe me from Beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess.
What?
You didn't hear?
If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
Winston found you.
All I did was walk out with it.
In a way, yes.
She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?
She still is. She doesn't want to get shot before she can tell you what happened.
Uh-huh.
You better be, motherfucker.
I'll give you his beeper.
Hello, Sam.
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
LET GO!
Just my luck.
There's nothing to expose.
Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to you?  What's going on? How can you just turn away?  What about the others?
Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
Maybe that's the only way to get through. Besides, six heads'll be better than one.
I know you. How come you're so tense today?
I saw Sarah the other day.
She says she can't get them new coats because you haven't sent the alimony for three months.
She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
I had to get in there. A deep adjustment. Rest a moment and let it set a bit.
I had this weird flash just then.
Am I dead, Louis?  Am I dead?
I'm walking, aren't I?
Ah!
Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
I see them, Prof. Everywhere. They're invading my life.
Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist?
Our doctors are seen by appointment only.
Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.
It's not healthy with it closed.
Who did?
Don't ask.
Maybe you left 'em in the bathroom.
You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
A good lay.
The best.
Lemme see.
Gabe.
I don't like things that make you cry.
I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
Hey, I'm here.
How high is that?
Hey, I'm not dressed.
Are we in Brooklyn?
While you were in the shower.
Let go!
I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.
It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
Bullshit!
Sit down, Jake.
You have quite a mind, Jake. I loved your friends. That chemist - the Ladder. What an imagination you have!
Jake, what is it?
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say.
Where are they?
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
Shows how much you knew.
No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
Right. They were worried. They figured you guys were too soft. They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? And we did it. The most powerful thing I ever saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my share, never compared to the fury of the Ladder.
But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
Hey, I'm not the problem. You've got bigger problems than me.
Pleasant dreams.
You got a nice tan, though.
If you're lucky.
He'll never make it.
Help me!
We're doing everything we can.
Paul Gruneger!
Nothin' much.
You and everybody else. God I hate this area. Makes me nervous.
Oh God. I know. I know.
No one knows. They say it blew up.
Punk?
He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay, you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.
No.
If we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her.
What?
What?!
Thorgan, pull us in.
Hey, easy now.
No, you're dead! You're all dead!
Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on!
Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
No you don't!
It's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.
I know you.
Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
I've waited long enough. Kay . . . you know what to do.
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
Forget her, she's a pain in the ass. Let her hang there.
Close the fucking door!
So what else is new?
Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!
You need to get laid!
Oh, alright.
Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.
Oh, goody. I'm so pleased. I'd clap if I could.
I love you.
This is a science excursion corporal. Just stay out of the way.
Obviously so.
I want him out of the ocean.
Sure, Dad.
What do you mean 'We...?'
Who's driving the boat?
Do you see the kids?
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' 
Like you're from N'Yawk. 
It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.
There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor.
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
No, it was local jurisdiction.
Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact.  Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.  -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?
You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch this?
Let's all have a drink.
Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught...
Rogue?
How can you tell?
No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean. They eat anything. But this one didn't eat any people. There's nothing here...
They must've hit something.
Be careful, for chrissake.
You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus...
I can't stand here doing nothing!
And nobody else saw her in the water?
Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
You from around here?
No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's in Tuxedo, New York, though.
That wasn't funny.
I can't believe that people pay money to go fishing. This is really dumb. This isn't even relaxing... it's just boring.
You're leaving?
Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.
C'mon, it'll give us time to think about what they're going to say.
Transplants?
I'll see ya. Tell Dorothy hello.
What do you see?
He's under!
Thanks for the message.
Your shorts are looking especially gold today.
I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.
Oh. That's a relief.
I still have your virginity!
Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Yup.
No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno?
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place?
They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
Oh, go fly a kite.
It really didn't hurt that bad having him.
I'm a junior.
Shit, yeah. Close it up.
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
Blood and guts.
Shut up.
Oh.
Yeah.
'93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll.
No, she's working late tonight. She's trying to accrue some extra time off for when, you know...
Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler?
No, more commercial stuff.
You're kidding!
Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready.
Uh, thanks.
I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage.
Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
Oh God, you're one of those guys...
Isn't that great? I got it when I was in Japan with my band. She reminds me of you.
I actually know this one.
That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
Oh man, I can just picture you slow dancing like a dork!
No?
Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.
Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front.
Well, you're lucky it's not you.
Nothing...
Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...
Doesn't it look like it's waving? It's kind of like it's saying "Hi, Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"
Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now!
Are you kidding? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. I'm like a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale.
Congrats.
No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.
The baby? I don't know anything about it yet. I only know it's got fingernails, allegedly.
I have no idea what kind of girl I am.
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
Jesus, I didn't say it was.
I am a suicide risk.
Dude, I'm pregnant.
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
That is sick, man.
What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos.
Hey, Juno. Juno! Look at this one.
Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
Why do people think yellow is gender- neutral? I don't know one man with a yellow bedroom.
What?
Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
What are you referring to?
I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.
...Yeah.
So you don't do any of those things.
Sorry. Boy I'll tell ya, if Early found a picture of me like that I'd be black and blue for a week.
Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn...  ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...
Go back to the car and keep Brian there. I don't want him in here...  Do it Adele... Now!
Well, it's like this, Bri'. I don't eat much in the mornin', never have. Maybe a beer once in a while; Lucky Lager's my favorite.
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
I always thought it was the work of a serial killer. Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. And again. Until someone stopped him.
Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back.
The party?
...just like that?
Because I was there. And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger.
He can't help the way he was raised. I kinda feel sorry for him.
I'm finished.
What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries.
Oh, I don't know... I think that once I dye my hair blonde, buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan... I could be veggin' out with the best of 'em...  Like fer shurr!
17.
Umm. Altogether?
Yes. Altogether.
You fucked it?
Oh shit. How long did it take?
Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies.
What for? That guys a dick.
Den less go Joe.
You down with the boost?
Unzip my pack, yo.
Yeah. "The Wonder Twins". You know.  Activate in the form of, a glass of water.
No, I'm serious man. I'm dead ass. Do you wanna try? We could be like the fuckin X-rated "Wonder Twins"!
Darcy?
It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember?
At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.
I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
Shut the fuck up.
Naw. But we should run by the park and get a dime. Maybe Darcy will be at the park.
What do ya want with Telly? That guy has enough bitches.
You sure?
Yeah me too.
Come on. You can rave on another night.
Of course I do.
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
But I only had sex with Telly.
Yeah.
Oh it's OK. That's life. Maybe tomorrow I'll win lotto. Who knows? You don't. No one does.
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
Yeah. Speaking of stupid shit. Him and his ape ass of a friend Casper, they all just almost killed some kid.
Yeah. She should be at Nasa tonight. Why you lookin for him? You like him now or sometin'?
That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex.
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
I'm gonna go out for a little while.
Nah.
Where does everyone sleep?
That shit is nothin'. I remember, I had just turned 14. With this fuckin' asshole who was like 18. I don't even remember his name. I think it was John or Jake or something. I remember he had a brother named Lentil because I would always joke and call him Lentil Bean. This was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit.
It's very monotonous.
Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes.  People have a lot of free time.  They like to gossip.
Casual?  You were boning her weren't you?
You like to play games, don't you, Peter?
His victims aren't random.  It only means that they appear to be random. There's a connection, we just have to find it.
There's a photostat of the original on the wall.
Then what's he talking about?
Get off me!
Yeah, I am.  I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?
I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.
Sanderson?
Did anyone stand out?
But a hundred men could move him.
He was with me?
Who is this?
Very nice speech, Peter.  Did you rehearse that, or was it impromptu?  There's an old wooden bench in the garden.  Next to it is a rock.  You'll find a message for you under it.  Let's see if you're as clever as you think you are.
Very good.
--you're hopeless!  You can't even read a sentence!  Didn't they teach you punctuation in school?  The game ends tonight!
No.  As usual you're wrong.  It is her I want.  Killing you would be easy. Living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat.
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
What scars?
Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.
I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
--the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before.  This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.
That has nothing to do with it.
For what?
How long has she been dead?
What about prints?
Yeah.
And this Jeremy--
I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?
That's a big area to cover.
It's over, Peter.  Let's stop the games.  I'm not sending a car.
Mate in five.
Sara, this is Doctor Sheppard.  I called you earlier about a book.
It's alright.
No.  I don't.
Uh huh.
Chess is a reflection of life.  Life is violent.  The strong win.  The weak perish.
I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with.
I can't right now.  I've got a game.
What if she isn't?  Where are your priorities?  You have to think between someone's life and a chess game?  The girl he killed last night was only twenty one years old!  He dumped her body behind a warehouse like a sack of garbage!
This isn't a game.
Oh, but it is.  He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  That's a game.  It has rules and objectives.
What about you?  Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
That's not fair!
Are you going to tell me you didn't feel something in there?
Very good.  Spoken like a true psychologist.  When confronted with the prospect of your own reality, hide behind quotations.  What is that Masters and Johnson?
Doesn't that scare you?
I'm not playing a game now.
No.
I thought you said the line was busy?
Where's the note?
Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.
Then help me to understand.  I want to understand.
Frank told me.
Well, then this time you'll have to stay for the whole match, won't you?
Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public.
<u>What</u>?
We're not married <u>yet</u>.
You can't reach her!  Through the door.  Quickly!
I won't leave you here.
I have no extraordinary powers.
But there is another entrance to this place.
Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
Darkness. Tunnels and corridors.  Wait.
Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.
Yes.
You must never know her name.  If more than one approaches, she will certainly kill them. Alone I may have a chance.
Let us wish him peace.
Yes. To keep her from you. But now that we are inside the Fortress, you will be able to contact her.
What will happen?
Yes. It is today.
Each to his fate.
You will not, then?
It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?
I have need of friends.
Well, it is true that if I received a royal command I couldn't very well disobey it, could I?
I'm glad.  I'm very glad.
We'll meet you at the inn.
No.
A small house.
No.
You do?
You can have half.
I only want one.
You had better manners as a pig.
Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison.
I am being exploited! Where are you going?
I must take the old man to see some sick children. Kegan will guard you.
He is the King.
You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.
I knew.
Yes. We lost five.
He leads a group of Slayers, under the leopard banner.
Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
It is not necessary. They will not follow.
You said nothing. You told me nothing.
No.
You will come with me.
OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
...Office 2702.
Yeah... How do you know it?
...What?
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
Listen, think about what you want to do, but don't worry, your money is there and it's safer than in a bank... Banks are robbed every five minutes!
How can you say it?
Yeah...  Come on, have a little training.
When I say I love you.
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.
I don't grow up any more. I just get older.
Mathilda, listen!
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
Huh?
It's a specialty down there.  It's a fishing boat with, in front, a long pole near the surface. Then, near the cabin, a very tall mast with a little cabin for the lookout.
Why am I such an authority?
You'd be visiting me at Nasa.
I'll make it.
I won't let you die.
A couple days to a few months if untreated.
Are you and your friends planning on driving soon?
Routine, I assure you.  I just wanted to gage my health.  Am I healthy?
The flowers... they're beautiful.
You don't think I love you?
I will -- I promise.
He's plastered.
When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica for a year.  I used to go to the beach everyday that summer. I never felt so happy, carefree. It was a magic place for me... That's where my heaven will be.
Yes.
I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.
Doubts?  About what?
Red flag, man.
Why so vague?  Why so evasive?  He could be somebody hot.
That's me.
You're amazing.
They called her 'Lizy' in the book...  Sorry I was late.  My jeep died on the way over from the paper.
Yes.
Where?
Walking where?
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
Forty-seven years.
Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
Orange soda?
Coffee?
I sold it this morning. I'm going to take cabs from now on in.
You do?
Want to kill yourself? Are you saying that you're drinking as a way to kill yourself?
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
What I mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. We're spending all this time together... what the fuck!
You haven't seen the worst of it. These last few days I've been very controlled. I knock things over... I throw up all the time.  Now I feel really good... You're like some kind of antidote that mixes the liquor and keeps me in balance, but that won't last forever. You'll get tired of it really quickly. Believe me.
I do. I really do.  OK. I have to do some shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. Don't hurry and I'll be back before you to let you in.
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
Of course.
No?
I tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me -- not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but I talked them into letting me walk you out.
Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
Where have you been staying?
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
He did leave a Cher tape in the pool house once --
Not really. I know how competitive it all is --
But you agreed last night. In the office? When we were discussing my "career"?
See?
What could I do?  He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me.
She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
Trust me. You've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual.
Delta. Gamma.
Margot!
No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers.
Aside from that.
So?
I never trust a woman who's not blonde. Except for my friend Serena, but that's only because she's a blonde at heart. That's the whole reason I'm starting the Blonde Legal Defense Fund.
That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination!
Projecting joy is not my job.
What?!
What're you talking about? You earned it --
Is he the only one?
I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks!
Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!
That's why I think it's time for us to --
How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
I'm seriously in love with you -- Isn't that enough?
Fine. Except for this horrible girl who made me look bad in front of my Civ Pro professor. But no biggie. You're here now.  How was your summer?
I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year.
It's not a Theta --
I mean, I know you're upset and all, but can't you just take a sedative?
Pull up next to him!
Fire moat... why do that?
Your words sting more sharply than your whip.
I like well what I see.  It pleases me.
I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
Don't please... I'll do what you desire...
I'm pleased you're not troubled by the prospect...
I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
You come stealee tleasoo?
Honeythorn Gump, is it?  I've not seen your ugly face since you sold me a jug of cow piss claiming it was dragon's tears.
To be sure.
No... I... I need to rest.
What!
I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.
I fear she's lost.
He is afraid of enchantment!  Will you listen to the fool prattle on.
If ye want more tricks, I'm your man, but for big questions ye must go elsewhere.
And if she thinks me a liar?
I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter.
What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
Something's coming.
We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
We march on Castle Couer de Noir within the hour.
I'm sure.  It spoke to me.
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
Be gentle with them, Jack.  They only march to please you.  Were this a faerie journey, we'd ride the wind on thistledown and ragwort stems.
It bodes evil.
Once you thought we'd never find the Greek's armor and look at ye now, decked out like a proper hero.
There aren't enough arrows.
What magic have we on our side?
Will you chance a miss?
Fire away!
It's what we'll find there worries me.
Can you save her?
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
Ah, but you will.  And so will the Baron, when we bring a little light to his dark hideaway.
Don't get too far!
Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
She lives... isn't that worth singing about?
Tis not the wound, that's sure.  Not a scar remains... we're talking about a spell; harder to repair than sword-work.
They'll do nicely.
If you like.
Blackheart.  Aptly named.
Unicorn?
Be patient.
Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.
They tricked you.
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
My lady mocks me.
Let it.  Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
You've freed me, Jack...
Sunlight?
You're teasing still.
Everywhere!  Ow!
His feet shall never cross my lips.
Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.
Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.
She's dead!
Dead, dead, dead.
As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom.
I pray God grants it me.
Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
No fear of that now.
I'd be honored.
And am I not fair?
You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
Heading north still?
We wait.
Of course they're alive.  All nature is living.
It's done... we'll never catch him.
What's wrong?
And why was the alarm on?
I'm supposed to be mad at you, but I'm not.
Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys.  I hate nose rings.  And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.
Is that legal?
He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.
I want you to try something with me, okay?
Where to?
I might not stay, anyway.
I'll get your back.
Really?
Hand me a towel.  I'm getting out.
Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?
Okay.  I guess.
Will he talk to me?
You've been good this week.
I mean, but did you both go camping on weekends?  Listen to music?  Masturbate together?  Talk on the phone?
He builds models for architects.  His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal.  Designed and built the coolest houses I've ever seen.
A sink?
That's too long.
We were probably in school together.  You went to Berkley?
I was a sophomore when I got the call my parents were dead.
What are you talking about?  You love your job.
For everything.
Thanks, I'd like that.  Thank you.
Nothing.  My dad's dying.  I really need to talk to Alyssa.
There are no windows facing my...exposure.
George, this is the third time.
I don't know.
I know what the deal is.  Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.
I'll get your bag.
You don't have a choice.
If you hit me, I'll call the police.
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
I almost saw Catalina.
Well, until you know, you can't go.
Sit down for a second.
No.
We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father.
How do you become something you're not?
What are you now?
That's not true.
We just weren't very much alike, I guess. I don't know.  I liked your dad more than I liked you.
Thanks for telling me.
Where have you been for a week?!
What did you do with your dog?
I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
At least we'll have a house to show for it.
He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.
Let's go.
Well, for later then.
I used to live here.
But you hated four out of the five you did.
It was perfect, George.  Amazing.  It was so real.
That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
My stupid back.
I'll find something that won't kill them.
You're a good mother.
I think so.
When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.
That was the truth.
I kept thinking about it, what you said... I hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me.
What did he say?
Does Alyssa know?
Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
So am I, Robin.  I'm working at something, too.  I'm even talking.  Do you want to be around for it?
You live a fabulous life, Robin.
Sam took them to a movie.
Are you wearing eye shadow?
Why?
I don't know what I'm doing.
Better make it a week.
Hell with him. It ain't that.
Is Spanky here?
No, but...
She's alright, isn't she?
She got married last month.
Real nice guy, too. Trumpet player. They moved down to New Orleans.
Yes, boss.
Yes, sir.
He's right, Gibson. Put down the gun and we'll work this out.
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
Sure, Claude, whatever you say.
Claude Banks. How could I forget that? You've got to remember me. Ray Gibson. We went to high school together.
Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.
Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
That's some long green.
I didn't start out to be a bank teller. I was gonna be a ballplayer. Even had an offer to play short for the Newark Eagles.
Why didn't you take it?
You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.
That's right, a loan officer.
Uh-huh.
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
My daddy gave me this watch.
Oh, I don't know, maybe because our lives depend on it, I just sort of thought you knew what you were doing!
What are you talking about?
He's dead.
It ain't here.
Come on, Ray, better get Winston back to the truck.
Hell with him then. If he can't share the driving, he can't ride in the truck.
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails.
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?
You get ketchup?
Don't matter who Camp 12 puts on the mound. All I know is when this season's over Camp 8's gonna have pork chops.
We're not talking, you're talking, and doing too damn much of it, if you ask me.
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
No, believe me, I'm gonna kill him!
What'd you say?
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
It's too late for plans.
Well, if you must know, they could be closer.
Life, huh? They step outta line again, we'll shorten up that sentence real fast.
Hey, Ray...
Don't you lie to me, Rayford.  You still have your daddy's watch?  Well, this is all I can give you. I wish it was more.
Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
If somebody deserves respect, Mr. Pike, they receive it from me, convict or no convict.
Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
Sure I've been to the Cotton Club. It's pretty sweet. But it don't hold a candle to the Boom Boom Room. That's where the real action is.
I slipped in a couple of bottles of my latest batch. Help wash down all them pills they'll be giving you.
He's sick?
I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
Noon...
Weed lowers the body temperature.  I read that... in, uh... er, science magazine.
You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
A speech impediment?
He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
Put it in your mouth.
I got energy up the ying-ying. Let's get cracking!
But those are my roommate's sodas...
"But those are my roommate's sodas..." Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make?
He superimposed your head onto "Scarface."
In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock.
Now he's got no ears! You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears!
The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.
Coulda been much worse.
That's what I'm thinkin'...
I can't enjoy anything. I go fishing. I catch nothing. I go to orgies, I catch everything...
We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
Yes, great movie...
You smell like coconuts.
It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
I don't need luck. I'm good.
My dad's an optometrist.
If you want to.
It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.
Sometimes, sure.
Basically, yeah.
I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.
...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
Off limits.
I've always wanted to kill someone. Can I do it?
I don't care... Just get it over with.
Did you ever see anybody renew?
Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do.
It has nothing to do with you.
Yes. Oh yes.  He was after you. I remember. You're running!
When do you go up?
No.  Just no.
Well then...?
I changed my mind.
And now?
You're years away... I don't know why you're thinking of these things, much less talking about them.  Want to try?
Maybe... sure...
Why tell me?
About running, dying what?
I let him go... believe me.
What do you need?
If you trusted me, you'd know.
You're not going, are you?
Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
I -- I can't.
He's good, isn't he?
I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.
For us.
It could be...
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
Things change!
You want to go back to kill, is that it?! Now, you'll want to kill your own!!! Kill Sandmen!!! Killing's all you ever...!!!
But there are so many of them. Do you know each one separately.
Yes indeed, everyone. Actually, they all have three.  "The naming of cats is a difficult matter. It isn't just one of your holiday games. You may think at first I'm mad as a hatter when I tell you a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES."  An ordinary name and a fancy name. That's two. Do you want to guess what the third one is?
Are you sure?
What's that?
Are there any other humans?
Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
Of course you can stay. This belongs to the people.
I promise. We'll go on as soon as it's light.
Stay? They lived together all their years?
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.  Can you do it? Will you?
They're comin' with us.
How I remember them. Not necessarily the way they happened.
The angle. The high angle shot on the tape.
If anything else happens, you'll call us.
Yeah.
Okay, then, I'll take you to dinner.
I used to.
He works for Mr. Eddy.
How'd you get in with these fuckin' people?
No... A job... I didn't know what. He set up an appointment for me to see a man.
I'm not goin' home tonight... I'm goin' somewhere else...  To a girlfriend's house.  But, we still have a coupla things to take care of...
Oh, yeah?... What else?
Up the stairs - down the hall.
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
Dick can't be dead. Who told you he was dead?
Yeah.
The police called us.
Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.
What happened to me?
No.
His physical condition.
Where is he now?
We'll get a tail put on him.
Pete, what happened to you?
He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away. We'll find out soon enough.
No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
Tone deaf.
My... My head.
But my head...
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
I don't know. Maybe a hotel.
But...
Okay... Lemme clear it with...
If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.
We just killed a couple of people...
You want some company?
Whatiya mean?
Sure. Sure I do.
I don't want to talk about it...
I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.
FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!!
A paleontologist.
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.
Don't call me brother.
Why, of course. Yes.
That's ridiculous.
Do you think they're cannibals?
Have I?
It's very strange, you know. You've never told us anything about yourself. Who are you, anyway? Why don't you take your mask off for once!
The police?
Uh-huh.  Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?
Sounds like a stall to me.
And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here. Why, we don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed!
They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
In a quandary.
I'll say.
Nothing. Why?
When are you going to start?
How do you do?
We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.
Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . .
buy and sell?
You're startled?
Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This thing or that killed him?"
Very often.
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]
How can we get in touch with them?
Don't believe him, Bob. He's just trying to get out.
Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago  you're still alive, Father Perrault!
Colonel, wait a minute, they may be here now!  Say George, get down on that field and guide those planes in when they get here.
Yes.
Come on! Quick! This way.
I'm going to drag him out and force him to tell us what his game is.
It looks like it.  Smell those fumes?
Yes.
Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  I think I'm going to like it here.
Nothing about the porters yet?
Shhh!
Why not? What's going to stop me?
What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
You've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility.
What's she got to do with it?
She came here in 1888!
Can't you shut up? Must you go on babbling like an idiot?
There's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us, but we must go on.  Come on.
On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here.
I'm so glad.
I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar. The very air that I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you - all somehow familiar.  I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably, with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why?
You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.
I was just going to.
How could I know that a war was going to break out right over my head!  Right over my head. Oh, my word! I tell you, those Chinese were pouncing on me from every direction. I had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape.
I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!
Yes.  Barney!
Well, I dunno.  I mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.
You got smeared.
No. just peace on Earth.
For instance...  It says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then...
We're the government, Cowan.
What happens if I say no?
Actually, it didn't come from me.
Then where did it-- ? Sir.  Forgive me, but it makes no sense. worked my ass off to grad--
Yes, air.  But I'm usually wrong. Sir.
What?
This is a college?  I'm sorry, I thought it was a carnival.
I know, I know.  I read the manual. No attachments.  We work alone. Blah. blah.
If you don't have anyone to tell, you won't tell anyone.  Believe me, you get used to it.
You don't know me at all.
Let's see... that was second gear..Kay shifts into THIRD.  Jay winces.
History's proven that where there's a nitrogenizer, there's a 12-legged signazoid.  They use it to make our food digestible for their systems.
Jeebs is eager to have me deport him. But would rather kill himself than go downtown. Why?
Why did Mikey leave Nazca?
Hang on.  There's gotta be something on this guy.    Did you contact the Alliance?  Do they have anything?
Everything left the planet, right? Except one thing.    That little insect-- the one we found in Sudbury.  Did it leave when everything else left?
Since as long as we've been keeping records...
Kay, you're scaring your partner.
Me, too.  I feel a long day coming on.
Actually, they disgust me.  But that's what I love about them.  Like a car wrack, you know, how you shouldn't look, but you always pull over and watch real close, or even pretend you're a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures?
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
I don't think so.   I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  But you...  Exterminator, I'd understand.  But entopolgist?  No way.
Maybe you need a closer look.
You figured what?
I understand.  I understand, thank you. --How about a transmographic dexahydrochlorophallomixaloosalyser?
It's... coming.
Nothing.
Did our friend announce when he's making his speech?
They're not my pals--
In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute.
Seriously.  I'm not going any further until you tell who you are.
Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
What?
Who?
Agatha...
Forget that guy --
She grew up.
Yeah --
I can't even stand up --
Drowning.
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
I'm not getting halo'd.
I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.  You've created a world without murder.  So what if you had to kill someone to do it.
The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
I show a cop on horseback.
Red Ball -- double homicide: one male, one female.  Killer's male, white, 40's.
From solar position, Trig & Image confirms it at approximately eight oh-four a.m.
Did Marks close the front door?!
Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
But you call this room the "temple".
I don't know.  He was shot and killed when I was fourteen on the steps of his church in Bethesda.
Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
There's no way of knowing for sure. She could've forgotten whatever it is you're looking for...
I need your help.
She's a precog?
It's a little late for that.
I'm a little dizzy...
You don't seem all that proud.
So many of them... despite what we did for them.  Or maybe because of what we did to them.  It doesn't matter.  It's a perfect system now, isn't it?
I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future.
The system would collapse.
Hold that thought.
I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
The safest place of all.
That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...
Then how did he --
No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
Lamar --
Tell him not now.
He's my subordinate!
I don't understand --
Nice to meet you.  Gum?
They're everywhere.
No.  He can't...
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
I know who you are.
Thanks.  You take anything in your coffee?
Cream and sugar.
Yes.
Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?
Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
He's great, right. Is he great?
I got news for you, Bobby, he don't give a shit.
No more.
Ricky, can you put on a seat belt?
Mommy's not home?
Yeah. Are you sure mommy's not home? It's very late.
Where were you?
Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?
Who's watching the baby?
They're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face.
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
Well, that's not gonna happen.
I feel weird asking him.
Go.
Good! It'll save me the trouble of repeating myself. He's not fucking driving you!
With what?
How could you let her see this?
Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.
Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money.
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
When's it going down?
What's that?
We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California.
No.
Where's Ricky?
Ricky's taken care of.
Never won a race. But it got me in with the trainer. We'd have a thing, I don't remember, some fucking thing. The jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd all go running. People get greedy. First they bet small, they keep their mouth shut. Within a month's time, everyone and their brother was in on it. The odds would drop, I mean you could watch the goddamn board. It looked like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast.
So, that's it. I'm out?
I didn't tell him shit. He worries too much. I love that old Jew, but he's gonna kill himself worrying. We started this shit, and we're gonna finish it.
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
No. Just the cross streets.
Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
I'm not gonna bring it up to him.
Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
I will.
I'll page you with the number.
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
I'll beat your ass --
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
Oh, I'll represent alright.
How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye.
I know you're not calling Jimmy.
They asked who it was.
What the fuck is that supposed --
Fuck this.
Back in.
Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
C'mon, man...
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
The penguin house.
Wait a minute. You want to look at fucking penguins now?
They only cover one fifty in incidentals. You've been ordering fucking... Motherfucker...
This is horseshit. It coulda been so easy.
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
I'll be a minute.
That's a good idea, maybe I will!
Yeah. I want it.
Well, come on then. It's back here.
The line's over there.
A little.
You look good, man.
Cool. See you later.
How much is what?
Yes.
Where do you live?
You strapped?
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
You really in trouble?
Come, now. You just got here.
That's alright, man. It's a little early for me to drink.
No, man, that's fine. Just put that you took delivery.
Jimmy? Ruiz. Pick up Maxie's guineas at LUNA and bring them to Spa.  Jimmy's bringing the car around. Me and Ho rode sleds. We'll meet you at Spa in the VIP room.
You think it's funny, motherfucker?
Word.
Soho Grand, right?
I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
The 'job?' Alls I know is I'm taking you to the Soho Grand.
Don't worry. I get it.
What?
Scotland.
Red, and I ain't no punk.
Where I come from. Boston.
How 'bout that?
I like you, country.
'Cause I want in. And it don't take a lot to know you there, daddy.
Just now.
Frisk me, baby. Give me a real pat down.
Let 'em come. I'm ready.
Nnnnnnn!
There's two guns on you.
You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
Man, I don't want to hear all that.
Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
No. Elijah Muhammad does not say "that white man is a devil." He teaches us that the white man is the devil. All white men.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
I don't know what to say to Allah.
Tell Him that.
Next week, Brother Minister.
Are you?
Being a good Muslim, a good nurse and a good wife.
I love you.
I'll be away a lot.
There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?
Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?
I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.
Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are you blind?
You have to sleep for three.
The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
For the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, "Do you hate me!" The white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate.
Women are deceitful. They are untrustworthy flesh. I've seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by women.
What?
Not yet. But the way things going, that boy gonna turn her out any day.
I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
All of your children are delinquent, Mrs. Little, and one, at least, Malcolm is a thief.
You'll regret this, Mrs. Little.
500.
What mission?
No. You'll be marked for death.
Shhhh! I don't like women that talk.
What's your story, baby?
You will, baby -- if the time come.
Lemme feed you, sweetie, while they hot.
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
Yeah.
That's right.
Don't you call me boy, you pig. Letting a man bleed like that.
He told you that?
This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him like a brother.
I was special. The only colored kid in class. I became a sort of mascot. Like a pink poodle.
I wasn't there. Like I was some kind of pedigreed dog or a horse. Like I was invisible.
Sit, Creasy. Everything that happens from now on does so with my permission.  Really. You won't find a better carne asada in all of Mexico.
[South America.]
[I'm on to Juarez.]
[The what?]
[Head of the anti-kidnapping division.]
[Romans, chapter 12, verse 21.]
[Do you know who I am?]
[Ordered by who?]
[I'm professional. I just do my job.]
[He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?
No. And no one is to know of your drinking problem. That includes my wife.
I'm here.
Nothing wrong.
Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse.
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
You got tossed. Don't trust the cops, especially the Judicials.  Oh you know that?
Maybe...
My last bodyguard. He drove me to school in the morning and picked me up in the afternoon.
Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
I know. But which state?
I'm looking for potential.
It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
No.
White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
I know you're not.
There's no such thing as tough. You're either trained or untrained.
Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough.
Be a swimmer.
Dyslexic?
You got that right.
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
Please, it's Lisa... I'll be coming with you tomorrow. I have lunch with friends.
Planned what?
What was her name?
For an American she understands this country very well.
[No. Why?]
I'm trying, mom.
We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked.
He's like a great big bear.  'Creasy bear'...
You realize that you've brought a killer into the house.
[It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.]
He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him.
Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better.
Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?
What makes you say that?
Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them? I'll take the one inna green dress.
You want me to ride down with you?
We just talked.
Come on over about half past seven, we'll think of something.  Hello, Ma, what's the matter?
Angie. He says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.
I feel fine.
Well, I always like to visit you, Catherine, because you always got such cheerful news.
You told me.
She gave me the evil eye.
I keep one eye open when I sleep, because she's gonna come in, stab me in my bed.
Catherine, don't make an opera outta this. The three-a you anna baby live in three skinny rooms. You are an old goat, and she has an Italian temper. She is a good girl, but you drive her crazy. Catherine, you are no fool. You know this is no good, an old woman living with a husband and wife. Two women inna same kitchen, anna house burns down.
Who?
Yeah.
I think anything you want to do, you'll do well.
I like you. I like you. I been telling you all night, I like you...
Please...
Okay.
It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
Sure.
Well, I'll tell you. I got stuck on a blind date with a dog, and I just met an old girl I used to know, and I was wondering how I'm gonna get rid of the girl I'm with. Somebody to take her home, you know what I mean? I'd be glad to pay you five bucks if you take her home for me.
No, I'm not kidding.
You're the accountant inna family, and I figure you might know about these things. My boss wantsa sell his shop to me. His kids are all married, you know, and he and his wife live alone, and they wanna move out to California where his daughter lives, so he wantsa sell his shop. He wants five thousand dollars down, although I think I can knock him downa four...
Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
Ma! Leave me alone!
Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?
She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?
She looks thirty-five, forty. She didn't look Italian to me.
I don't know! She don't look like Italian to me. Plenny a nice Italian girls around.
Hey, Lou, gimme two bottles-a beer...
I can't do that, Ralph, because somebody already brushed her off once tonight.
Oh man, you shoulda come with us last night, Marty. That one for you was a real lunatic. How'd you make out?
So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt Theresa, and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how I waste money and how I can't cook, and how I'm raising my baby all wrong, so she got me so nervous, I spilled some milk I was making for the baby...
No, Virginia, I know how you feel.
Tommy...
I don't wanna talk about it!
Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?
Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
They've hit us on Cherry Hill. I just got word. We have our slack periods but when the action starts, you'll have more work in twelve hours than a civilian surgeon does in a week.
Sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.
Pour one for Painless.
Or her figger.
What the hell's going on here?
Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate.
Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.
Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door.
Nothing can't wait. Shall we check it out with the Major?
You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
What do you think, Trapper?
A native is someone who is born in a particular place.
You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.
All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...
I worked with Spearchucker my first month over here, at the 72nd Evac in Taegu. Most of the colored guys know who he is but they're not talking because he asked them not to.
Any time. Whenever we want.
I looked. Suspicious bastards got them all locked up.
No. The only thing to do is write General Hammond.  But it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion.
Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
What?
I'm impressed, Pierce. Naturally, the kind of job I have, I don't get much chance to keep up with what goes on in the OR.
Also I'm curious whether she's a moaner or...
Oh, I'm not sailing with you. I work out of the hospital here.
Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
We can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones.
He can move in here with us.
Okay, Major, honey.  I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. I'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine Regular Army clown. And that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine.  See you around the campus.
Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...
It's possible
For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
You're an attractive man.
And absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband. Do we have that in common, Captain?
A man would be more considerate. He wouldn't come home to his wife a nervous wreck.
You should have been a marriage counselor.  But I'll show you what's wrong with your theory.
I didn't mean with me.
It happens to be a matter of life and death.
Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
I didn't have much choice.
Yeah!
Excuse me, Sergeant.
The one and only.
That's about the only thing I don't do  that I'm built for. I inspect the girls and take care of some of the kids in the hospital. Sometimes I tend bar and act as bouncer.
Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.
Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through.
Right, Ho-Jon. See you later.
We don't want any more than that.  Right now.
Yes, that's what I mean.
Sir?
Sir?
Morning, Radar. How were things?
Splendid, sir. No problems.
What's that, Henry?
Mine's already been struck, and it doesn't have to be very fancy.
Now?
Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column.
Yeah. Lavender and old lace!
Oh, crabby guy, huh?
Well, all those guys in the bleachers think
Against what?
You got me.
John Doe, the one in the speech.
Never mind. Let him alone. He's all right. I'll be right over there pulling for you.
How much money do you get?
Oh.
Oh, yes, Father certainly would.
Huh?
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
The letter from John Doe.
There is no letter.
What John Doe?
So?
Packs everything, including a gun.  Okay, sister, you've got yourself a deal. Now let's take a look at the candidates. The one we pick has gotta be the typical average man. Typical American that can keep his mouth shut.
No, no, no! You can't take pictures of him like thateating a sandwichand with a beard!
We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel roomunder bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him.  Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
Well, what about it?  Let them see him!  We'll go them one better. They can also hear him.  You own a radio station, Mr. Norton. Why not put him on the air?
Trying to improve the world by jumping off buildings. You couldn't improve the world if the building jumped on you!
Where's Connell?
Oh. Gee, you're swell! Oh.
Take charge of him. Get him a suite at the Imperial and hire some bodyguards.
Go on, go on, go on. And we'll be at Jim's Bar up the street.
And let me tell you, Long John. When you become a guy with a bank account, they got you.  Yes sir, they got you!
Who?
The heelots!
Yeah. That'sthat's him. Of course, you don't know Grubbel, but he's the man that everybody figured was the worst no-account in the neighborhood because he was living like a hermit and nobody'd have anything to do with him. Er, that is until Murphy, the postman told us the truth. "Why, Grubbel," he says, "he lives out of garbage cans because he won't take charity. Because it'd ruin his self-respect," he says.
Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
Hiyah, John.  John, I want to have a little talk with you.  What's the matterare you falling? Come here.
You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
They can't, huh?  Who do you think writes 'em? My Aunt Emma? I know she writes them.
Well, I'm stuck with two and twobut I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it.  Where do you come in?
I think maybe you'd better. And ConnellI'd like to have the John Doe contract, all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter Miss Mitchell wrote, for which I gave her a thousand dollars.
Yes. Sure.
No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't let the Chronicle get the laugh on us! We've got to produce a John Doe now.  Amateur journalism, huh!  I'll show those guys.
Oh!
Racket? What do you mean?
How?
I think it must have been a sea- gull.
Yeah, okay.
You want me to go up with you?
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street?
Leave town? They're going to know me in fucking Des Moines now!...  They got over ten million in jewels in that place. That's freedom, man. I could go anywhere I want.
Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail?
Nobody knows who you are. Make it look like a robbery.
It's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate. It's been this way since the cuban missile crisis.
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
I appreciate your concern. Let's leave it at that.
How did you like Toronto?
I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for "fast advancement".
We could fill it with water.
I don't really like to drink.
Around. Barnett's tough competition.
It'll come. Try again.
What's the first commandment?
A dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. A Berretta nine millimeter in his belt. A female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. A female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine.
To run last?
The jockey!
You want to bet on whether you won your bet? This is getting sick.
Police corruption. It's everywhere.
And what about the ones you don't save?
Then we better get moving... But there's no way we can get the jewels out of evidence.
I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.
I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count.
I worship you.
Did you know he's already got a bad knee? In another 10 years you're going to be pushing him around in a wheelchair.
This Greg is really getting in my way.
Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
Scott, You can't save everyone.
You think I didn't need you?
What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.
I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
Here comes the wire... and... Backtrack gets up in the last jump. Cozy girl a very game second.
There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress...
What happened to your Trans Am?
You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
Who's running it!
Come on!
What do you need?
Because I took it out of your memory.
Just like you always wanted.
From the dream.
Not my problem.
Not real?
Unfinished business.
And what about the reconfiguration?
-- Yes.
He's not plugged-into the system. He's in the fucking system!
Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us --
He wouldn't say.
Try harder.
Tanner.
What are you talking about?
Try me.
There?
Describe program function.
Destination?
Tanner-eighteen-six-two-nine.
Select uplink for Federal Communications Office.  Department of Enforcement.
If we don't try, Zordon won't survive!
Activating Power Beam!
I think so.
I am the crane, agile and sublime!
WE'VE GOT TEN TRIACS BEFORE WE'RE TOAST!!
Ryan's Comet!!
GIVE IT EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT!
THERE'S THE COMET!
Wait for me!
Quack like a'duck!
How'd you know?
And I ain't no nigger either!
When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
Minimum security. You'll have everything but broads.
And a lot more. Can we talk?
The goddamned bastards.
Hey, I ignore my wife too. But on our honeymoon I paid attention.
Not another word.
Life knocked me back.
I came into this world flat on my ass.
And now you have everything.
An intelligent plan, Mr. Luciano, but listen to me well. It can be ruined in a single careless moment. Keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.
When you're investigatin', how long ya keep at it?
Which is why he doesn't need us.
You got men on Profaci's place?
We got our boys paintin' the house next door. Around the clock. We're gonna keep old man Profaci alive if it takes twenty coats.
How's Bugsy doin'?
Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.
No. They envy you.
I was calling yesterday.
Without us, Masseria don't stand a chance, and he knows it.
I been thinkin'...
And if we don't invite Maranzano, we can't invite Masseria. Guys don't wanna be choosin' sides.
Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
Ya piss like a man.
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.
So he can talk to all the families behind your back? Maybe have his own meet at 3:00 AM under the goddamn boardwalk? No. You're too smart for a sucker play.
Didn't know you felt that way.
Tell me, Charlie. Please.
Joe Profaci. Carlo Gambino. Vinnie Mangano. Joe Bananas. They all gotta die.
Shit. When I was comin' up, bein' fat meant ya had somethin' ta eat. Guy looked like you, people felt sorry for 'em. Right, Gerardo?
Sittin' around gives me the piles. You got a proposition?
And the Jews?
I don't fuck my partners.
You and me both. Sal-va-to-re.
No matter what you say to me Salvatore, you are my bambino.
That's just what I'm sick of. Everybody lookin' ta knock somebody off! Greedy for what you got. A bunch of fuckin' hogs at the trough.
A peaceful and prosperous retirement.
If it comes to that. Yeah.
Yeah. But he needs me alive.
Guess I'm just lucky.
That's just what they're calling ya pal. Lucky Luciano.
What's it worth to ya, Boss?
Guess so. Ya got a minute? I got somethin' for ya.
Stu. That was right about the time we met.
I can't explain this, Alice, but I'm not so sure it did. It's as if...he's <u>not Stu</u> any more. The Stu I love is gone! <i></i> He spends all his time in the garage. He says he's...autographing.
They had a case like that at Johns Hopkins. Wires got crossed between hands and feet.
I'm sick of martinis. I'm sick of the waiting, and the carnival rides, and watching people's <u>nightmares</u>. And of course, I need not <u>add</u> -
I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
Uh huh. And?
You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
Oh yeah. Mr. By-the-book, Stick-Up-the-Ass, My- Way-or-the-Highway Death. Believe me - over the course of eternity, you get pretty damned tired of <u>that</u> schtick. <i></i> So I need a job. He sticks me in this broke-down amusement park, with a buncha animals to run it. I'm supposed to be <u>grateful</u>?
But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
That was <u>especially</u> Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be <u>us</u>. Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you.
Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
When'd you get in?
I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine.
The ring...
Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--
<i></i> HEY!! HEY, YOU!!
Well - yeah - but that doesn't...<u>apply</u>. It was different then. I was <u>depressed</u>. My life is great now. I'm in love!
Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. - DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.
My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
I'm just concerned about my daughter.
What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
What pictures?
That's not true.  Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York.
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
Aaron?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.  It's my first time in New York.  Just a minute.
All the ex-vice-Presidents. You can get ten-to-one around here if you think you can remember their names. The Vice-President presides over the Senate--you know that. It's how he earns his pay. Oh--over there, Senator-- on the east side of the Chair we still have the old snuff boxes with real snuff in them if you like snuff.
You've never *seen* this contract.
But it *isn't*?
Blow a bugle!
Sure--sure. He must have a compass with him.
Eight to five Little Boy Blue is plastered.
What's this, Diz?
I would cherish you--and stay sober.
Who?
Yeah. What about the second act?
Well, well--  Yeah--I got smart and thought I'd slip one over on the old man in the press meeting. I said, "Mr. President, about the monopoly investigation--" And he jumps right in and says, "Diz, if you were sitting in my chair, would you answer the question you're about to ask?" He had me.
Paine.
Okay. You don't mind?
What?
Don't say "okay," Diz. Say you think it's beautiful.
No--not offhand--
I won't take it! See? I won't be party to murder. See? Steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that grafting Taylor mob is low enough. But helping that dame cut him up in little pieces besides--nobody's gonna make me do that. No, sir.
Take me home, Diz.
Not a word! Taylor's sewed up every paper. They're tossing out everything that comes in over the wires!
Freedom of the press! Mr. James Taylor blindfolding a whole State--  Wait a minute! If that's how he wants to play *I'll* get through to that bunch--I'll get plenty of words into that, State--!  Come on, Diz, get that stuff you've written--let me have it--
That infernal phone!
This isn't a home, it's the crossroads of the world!
For instance, how to run the affairs of government? No doubt my children could make this appointment *for* me-- with the greatest ease!
Emma, which is it--Horace Miller or Henry Hill?
I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*--
Jim--if I fling a party man like Horace in the face of those angry committees--
He's the hero of fifty thousand boys and a hundred thousand parents. Look at these congratulations pouring in! I tell you, gentlemen, by this one statesman-like act, I have--
You'll see those committees when we're finished!
*Henry Hill?* That crackpot? That long-haired--! Why, you should have killed that so fast--!
Oh--Jim!
No doubt. No doubt. And this fine little paper--"Boy Stuff"--with, I dare say, an *enormous* circulation in the State.
Is *what* getting me down?
What stuff?
Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?
Well, it sort of got to be--from Jeff just pullin' splinters and things--
Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?
I yield.
I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
Goodnight, Miss Paine.
But--there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water. Besides--I talked to Kenneth Allen, who owns some of that land--and he didn't say anything about a dam. No-- I'm sure, sir--there's something wrong--and I--I won't vote on this thing until I get a lot of questions answered--
Will he yield for a question?
Will he *yield*?
It does!
How's Amos, Ma?
But you have some objections here and there. And maybe right, for all I know. But the point is--there's no sense stopping the whole works now-- specially after some men have worked hard for a long time to put this through--
You're a liar!
Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--
Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you right in the mood--yes--yes.
I mean--gosh--I wouldn't be comfortable in a--I--I haven't got clothes and things like that--and--I couldn't keep pigeons *there*--No--I-- I just--just wouldn't be--
Well, then, I--I *thank* you, Miss Saunders! Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, we're going right ahead with it!
Right.
How?
Look--committees--small groups of Senators--have to sift a Bill down-- look into it--study it--and report to the whole Senate. You can't take a Bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men. Where would you get?
Yes, I see that.
Some committee's got it.
Yes. They give it to a *sub*- committee, where they really give it a going over--hold hearings--call in people and ask questions--then report back to the bigger committee--where it's considered some more, changed, amended, or whatever. Days are going by, Senator. Days--weeks. Finally, they think it's quite a Bill. It goes over to the House of Representatives for debate and a vote. *But* it's got to wait its turn on the calendar--
Try sitting down.
Now, this camp is going to be out in your state, of course--
Have I?
Terrible, thank you.
I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time--  I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it?
Second drawer.
I mean it. I--without you, I could't've--
Wow!
Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
We'll *find* one! Only throw compromise out of the window--stick to Jeff Smith, the man who first came to this town--get up and *fight*-- and we'll find *some* way. I don't know where we'll wind up--but the flag'll be flying--!
Not *me*! Joseph Paine is the man they ought to be listening to! Come on!
A camp! Well!
You see--if we could take the poor kids off the streets--out of cities-- a few months in the summer--learn something about Nature and American ideals--
Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful.
Senator, you can talk all you want to, now.
Oh--you're *sure* of that now?
What! Who?
What do you mean? What's going on?
A Bill! Not *him*!
Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm surprised at you, Mister McGann-- 
Joe--I'm getting leery of this guy. We keep calling him dumb--and he keeps winding up in our hair! I'm telling you--when he finds out there's a dam going up where he wants his camp, he's gonna start asking questions six ways from Sunday--
Shut up! You've *got* the man pilloried! Do you have to dance around him like a cannibal--!
No?
You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see--
Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--
What are you driving at? You want *me* to get him to sign that?
Yes--
I know, but is it worth the risk of a scandal now that a new man is going to the Senate?
Jim, you can't come here and pull that steamroller stuff. Your methods won't do here. This boy is a Senator, however it happened, he's a Senator. This is Washington.
Jim, you don't have to--
Oh, it's all right--it's all right. It seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years, especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe, I've put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends, but I guess we'll survive. We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense, that's all. In the meantime, you explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam. It's your bill-- it's your reputation, and if he can't find enough facts to break you with, you just send him to me and I'll give him a couple of good ones. I'm taking the next plane home.
Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
All right, we'll take Jeff with us--
What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
Who's that?
And sings.
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
NO!!
That's all, Miss Bennett. That's all.
No - not at all. I couldn't sleep either.
I don't blame you.
Yes, here we are again.  Good night.
No. It's nothing.
I'm crucifying him.
Can I have a month's vacation?
If we could sell tickets, we'd make a fortune.
Print one line of that, and I'll blow your place up!
I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
Telling him is the long shot - I'm going to take it.
Yes, but you said
Fourteen carat?
I wish you luck, sir.
He's not home, I tell you!
Proceed.
Mr. Cedar!
Mr. Deeds is drawing on his warped imagination!
Wants to know who the heir is.
Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney
No, we won't! The next time that jumping jack comes out, I'll straddle him while you ask him your questions.
All set.
Yes.
Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington yet.
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
He and Jim Mason own the Tallow Works. But that's not where he makes his money. He makes most of it from his poetry.
I don't think we've got any suitcases.
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
Oh.
He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
Well, maybe I will have a sandwich.  Do you mind waiting a few minutes?
Why, it's an artistic institution
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
Me?!
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
What about it, Mr. Deeds?
Why, I turned them down, naturally.
Huh?
Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
Take the stand!
Thank you, Your Honor.
Uh-huh.
Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet  thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
You gentlemen going to stay for lunch?
Excuse me. What did you say?
But how'll I put on the slipper, sir?
Get out.  The evil finger's on you. Get out!
I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.
You must have been concerned.
Could you come with me please?
Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
Of course... I've heard great things about you.
What kind of doubts?
Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.
It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
I didn't hear you.
Now we're back on track.
-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
Doc. Nice to meet you.
I do.
I'd better get in there.
You do?
Not sure. Let me think about it.
Why do you watch?
Doc.
He told you.
You're right, as usual. See you.
Don't need it.
Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway.
Take a hike, Dr. Quack!
I'd better not, I'll fall right to sleep. I think it's too soon for me to be sleeping with you.
Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.
Even if you don't think it's real?
Something's bothering her.
I've offended you!
Be specific.
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
I'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old?
And this is legitimate therapy?
I bet I know what changed your mind...  ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
Is something wrong, Sofie?
You're upset.
I think so.
You're not the only one...
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
Will you be here?
What are you talking about?
Fine. Okay. Pretty good. I've been hoping we'd meet. I've heard a lot about you.
Panda? I've always liked giant pandas... I've been to China and seen them in the wild. That's the kind of thing I can do if I want... now. I can do pretty much anything I want to do these days.
I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?
I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
Good-looking woman.
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
That's all right. What's on your mind?
It's true, believe me. So... do you know what I've been doing, all alone, in my workshop, for almost two years?... Mr. Find-the-Need-and-Fill- It. How I spend my every solitary hour?
Really?
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
It matters to me.
All new people start with that...
Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?
Why don't I call you when I've got my calendar in front of me?
I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
Just looking for you, O'Connell! I wanted to be with my friend!
What friend? You're my only friend.
Something about bringing his dead girly-friend back to life. He needs the book...  And your sister.
That's one way of putting it.
Try me.
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
You swear?
I found sand. I saw death.
Oh that's comforting.
The things that get you excited.
How?
You don't believe in curses, huh?
No. I believe if I can see it and I can touch it, then it's real. That's what I believe.
And what is that?
Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.
I'm staying.
I'm your sister.
Personally, I think he's filthy, rude and a complete scoundrel. I don't like him one bit.
Well neither do I, thank you.
Read the inscription on the cover!
We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister.
Awfully.
Be nice. That thing saved my life.
No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing,
Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see who's inside, shall we?
The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!
You have got to be joking?
Head hunting.
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
He was cute though.
Half a Dirty Dozen!
Hello?
Just a waitress.
I thought you'd chickened out on me.
Sure.
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
You don't seem very angry right now.
And what if you get killed?
Then at least I will have died trying, right?
And you are a fool.
See ya tomorrow.
The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
Normal. What's normal? Does normal exist? And if it did, how would we know it?
Not yet.
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
Oh hi, Mom.
But... the silverware?
Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
Or Batman --
General Kutusov, feel free to say whatever you like.
For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.
Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?
I know absolutely nothing of war -- and I am still totally dependent upon my generals.
Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.
Properly arranged, yes.
I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont.  I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day.  Each marshal has been keeping his own position.
And where is Joseph?
Ah, my poor Josephine.  She was the most alluring, most glamorous creature I have ever known -- a woman in every sense of the word, and she had the kindest heart in the world.  She may have been a liar and a spendthrift, but she had something that was irresistible -- she was a women to her very fingertips... How impossible it is to believe that she is dead.
Yes, sire?
No, sire... I was asleep.
Excuse me, General Bonaparte, but I believe this is an extremely urgent matter, requiring your immediate attention.
Ajaccio.
Ah-hh, no.
I see...
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
How did it spread so quickly?
It is the work of incendiaries.
My God -- this could be very bad for us... very bad, indeed.
Does your mother know you have come?
Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month.
Yes -- an excellent idea.
I very much doubt that he will.
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
My mind is made up.  She will not set foot in my house again.  I think if I saw her again, I might be tempted to strangle her.
Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.
My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.
Only as a last resort.  What are the Councils doing now?
Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps?
Well, I'm sure that you will be just as pleased to have this as he will be.
And now?
No.
Will you be joining us, soon?
Five minutes.
Yes!!
Yes.
It's me.
Oh, my darling.  I'm sorry, too.  I won't do that again -- whatever you do.  I won't cause you any more embarrassment, I promise.
There's probably some explanation.
Nothing.  That's all I can say.
Well, whatever the hell you wanted to do, you are going to tell me everything right now.  Do you understand?!
What?
And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.
Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
Yes, my dearest Marie-Louise, I am your husband.
You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
Those are extremely harsh terms.
I very seriously doubt it.  I don't think there is any possibility of making peace with England so long as she sees herself safe from invasion. That is why we must increase the pressure on her economy.  With Russia in the Continental Blockade, England must collapse.  More than 40% of her trade is with the Continent and Russia.
And where do you place Alexander?
Alexander and I are friends.  We have reached an understanding.
Eugene de Beauharnais.
That's it?
Just tell him to come over here and talk to me.
Don't move me.
Come on, Day, try it.  For moms.
What about the dog?
Fuck, what's his name?
I said shut up!  Now who sent you?
Lay down, Day-Day.  Stop moving.
Yeah, I'm alright.  Is my face still orange to you?
What?
Damn, you got a stalker.
I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the same thing.  But it can't happen.
If you 'get into it' with them S.A.'s and start a feud, you can always go back to home.  I gotta live here.  Just remember that.
Yeah, ya'll got a notice today.  It came certified mail.
I don't know.  Did ya'll forget to pay it or something?
Okay, plan B.
I know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters.
Big bitches need love, too, Craig.
Still gonna smell it.
How you know?  It could be anything.
Naw, you go first.
Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good together.  Where you going?
To the Cucamonga shopping center.
It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys.
Hurry up; today is Fri-day!  And we gotta hit the high-way!
Well bring yo' ass on...
I do.
Smokin' what?
You damn right that's the big one.
Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.
Are you out your mind?  I'm not messing with them S.A.'s boy.  You must be crazy.
Where's Craig?
He's inside the house?
I know.  I'm sorry.
Shut up!  Where's that other miyatea?
I don't know the number.
Yeah, I got a urgent message for a customer named William Jones.  Drop everything, Craig is in trouble.  Come quick.  Don't try to call.
I'll take you later.
Elroy.
Okay.  Bye, Craig.
San Diego.
Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego.  It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops.  Can't make a dime on 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck. These little hops cost me money.
You were very nervous.
And your husband works for somebody else.
For not believing you.
Of course you're invited. You're a big donor to the campaign. They love you.
You fucked up.
Forget about it.
Don't you threaten me.
No, that's,..that's fine
Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara Grant.
You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me.
I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
Nods.
Right.
I can hear you good. Can you hear me?
No. Kisses to you.
No, kisses to...
I'm just an accountant.
Keep it.
Kill the Governor.
This is about power and you haven't got any. There's nothing more you can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying.
It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.
I don't think so.
I think this is worth a dollar.
Laughs.
I've got something for you.
You ask too many questions. You want the surprise or not?
Yeah.
Yeah.
The religion the Almighty and me worked out betwixt us.
If you was to let that money serve the Lord's purposes, He might feel kindly turned towards you.
Dad, you're bleeding...
Pshaw now! Ain't it a caution what women'll load onto a feller's back when he ain't lookin'?
When'll the skiff be ready?
Yes! Yes!
IN THE RIIV-ER!
John don't like him much.
John! Don't!
Pearl! Oh, Pearl!
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
Somewheres. I don't know yet.
That's Daddy!
Ssh...
Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.
-- and when we come back, we'll all be friends -- and share our fortunes together, John!
Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
I don't know nothin'!
Why, sure. And there's fried chicken and candied sweets and cornsticks and apple cobbler!
A strange woman is a narrow pit!
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
Maybe she's just run off on a spree.
Where's she at?
He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
No, nothing.
Who was scary?
Shut up and let me in. You ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet?
Slept like a rock.
You believe in anything?
I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately.
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
Well what you reading it for?
I heard your ma went ape at the security store today. You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something. How long's it been since you slept?
Who?
Yeah, and if he gets me, I'm pretty sure you're next.
You got a sane explanation for what he did?
You know he's dead though, right?
Deal.
Cause I thought Glen was gonna sneak out to see your lunatic daughter, that's why. So I locked him in his room!  Sorry. Anyways, the door was still locked when we heard the screams.
School.
I won't.
I will.
You're not falling asleep, are you? You could drown, you know.
No.
Right. Well, she didn't, exactly...
I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater; I dream in color, y'know; he walked into the room I was in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and just stared at me. Sort of... obscenely. Then he walked out through the wall on the other side. Like he'd just come to check me out...
Guys can have nightmares too, y'know. You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something.
From Leon!... How is he?... Come, tell us... open it... tell us... how is he?
Good evening, Ninotchka.
You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
Ninotchka, you know I am your friend, you can trust me.... Did you bring back anything else?
Evening gown?
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
You can have it for good. It is my wedding present.
Possibly.
I should be a swallow! Right now I would be sitting in front of the Caf de Paris picking up flakes of French pastry that would melt in my bill.
No, no.
Count d'Algout is still asleep.
That's all right.
Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!
Emphatically not, sir. The prospect terrifies me. Now, don't misunderstand me, sir, I don't resent your not paying me for the past two months, but the thought that I should split my bank account with you... that you should take half of my life's savings... that is really too much for me.
Certainly.
That's perfect!
Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia?
He wouldn't say that. What he would say is "Buljanoff, you can't afford to live in a cheap hotel. Doesn't the prestige of the Bolsheviks mean anything to you? Do you want to live in a hotel where you press for the hot water and cold water comes and when you press for the cold water nothing comes out at all? Phooey, Buljanoff!"
What is it, my boy?
I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
Just three people in a room this size? Whew!
Just a moment.  I hope you haven't closed this deal, Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you into serious difficulties.
We can't... but you are so ingenious, Leon...
No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?
Yes, there's no doubt of that...  Just look out of the window and there it is.
That's two weeks from Thursday...
Well, there's nothing we can do about it. Why get excited?
What can I do about it?
Not always... look at me... I've been back twice. 
Private.
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.
So it's love which drags you to Moscow.
Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.
Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we?
Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.
Yes, very strange.
And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
Please don't misunderstand me...
I will do my best.
Thank you. I've had all the calories necessary for today.
We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?
Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.
That is correct.
Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.
Oh, my barbaric Ninotchka. My impossible, unromantic, statistical...
The telephone is ringing.
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
But my dear child, I am most at home among working men. I hate the places where you circulate -- the Hotel Clarence... This is my natural element. After all, what are any of us? Workingmen! At least, those of us who are worth our salt. Hyah?
What?
Why?
Not radio. Let's have music that's just for ourselves.
Leon, you know the jokes you told me a few days ago? I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them. Now, Leon that's wrong. I know they're not funny, they're silly. They're stupid. And still... I laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they are scoundrels and I should hate them -- then I realize who made them like that, and instead of sending my report to Moscow I tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat... and if this keeps on... am I too talkative?
Anything, Ninotchka.
Did you make any change in this room?
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
No speech?
No speech.
It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street.  There they are... they are terrible things, those jewels....
Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?
Now, Swana...
Darling, calm down. Why do you need a lawyer? Haven't you your little Volga boatman?
Not in your condition.  Make it tepid, Gaston... tepid and tender. And lay out his gray suit.  Afterwards I'll drive you through the Bois. Slowly... in Waltz time.
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
Brutal frankness, if you insist.
And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?
She's gone, Leon.
That does it, Swana.  Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.
What?
If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
You mean you have finished the whole investigation?
May I ask what has happened?
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.
Oh, madame! This is a restaurant, not a meadow.
It's just a place for workmen.
Why do you bring this up after so many years?
You did say it, sir.
But sir, we'll have to start over from the beginning.  We don't have the staff to ...
He's nervous, sir.  He's heard you're looking for a new director.
I mean, who the hell cares about this penny-ante shit.  Goldwater put it right.  He said: "Well for Christ's sake, everybody bugs everybody else; we know that." ... It's the cover-up, not the deed that's really bad here.  If only Mitchell could step up and take the brunt of it; give them the hors d'oeuvre and maybe they won't come back for the main course.  That's the tragedy of all this.  Mitchell's going to get it in the neck anyway. It's time he assumed some responsibility.
Is it?
That's not the question, John.  The question is: Why is he paying?
I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.
Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you.
It's the fall of the Roman Empire, are you blind?  And we're putting fig leaves on the statues ...
Sure, they did stuff, but nothing like this, Bob.  Forget Watergate, the break-ins, the Enemies list.  You got an attempted firebombing at the Brookings Institution, planting McGovern stuff on the guy that shot Wallace, trying to slip LSD to Jack Anderson.
So you tell Mitchell ...
He left his White House phone number in his hotel room.
Why not?
Yeah, good old Spiro.  Well, better him than me.  What the hell is he but an insurance policy?
No, no.  He's our only "star" right now.  He'd go crying straight to the press.  He'd crucify us -- the sonofabitch!  Get someone from our staff on his ass. Tap his phones.  I want to know everyone he talks to.
Damn right.  And there's still a helluva lotta people out there who wanna believe ... That's the point, isn't it?  They wanna believe in the President.
This could trigger the impeachment. They'll go to the Supreme Court next.
Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
A dozen?  I got half of 'em elected. I still got the South and Goldwater and his boys.  I'll take my chances with the Senate.
He's completely lost touch with reality.
Your lawyers feel it's the ... "smoking gun."
I don't know anything about that.
Yes, you approved it, sir.
What do you mean, sir?
We'll work on it.  I say we cut ourselves loose from these clowns and that's all there is to it.
You approved that before the fact, because I went over it with you.  But ...
No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
It's okay, Bob, we're just rapping, my friends and I.  We actually agree on a lot of things ...
I believe you're right, boss.
... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...
We ought to fire his whining ass. Right now when he's on top.  You know what -- it'll set the right example for the rest of this administration.
Yes, Mother ...
What about happiness, Mother?
I didn't choose him as my deputy, Mr. President.  You did.
Current levels may not be sufficient.
Yes.
We have recent intelligence that a Soviet nuclear submarine has docked at Cienfuegos.
CIA policy?  The CIA has no policy, Mr. Helms.  Except what I dictate to you ...  I try to adjust to the world as it is today, not as you or I wanted it to be ten years ago.
Flowers are continual reminders of our mortality.  Do you appreciate flowers?
He's lying, Clyde.  Always has. That's why Nixon's always been useful. Hold still.  And take your hand off your hip.
If things remain as they are ... He's got the anti-war vote.
The old queen did it on purpose.
Don't listen to 'em, don't quit. Remember - Kennedy, Bobby, and King were against the war.  Where are they now?  Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war.  President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace!
Well, you have CIA people all over the place.  Helms has seen to that.  Then there's Kissinger's staff. Kissinger himself, I believe, maybe the leaker.
Jesus, I'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office.  He comes in here ranting and raving, dumping his crap all over the place ... Could you prove it, Edgar?
I won't tell him if you won't.
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
Personally, I'll be calling the President of the United States.
That sonofabitch Kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow.  Dick, we're willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him -- more money'n you ever dreamed of.
Finally someone who's noticed!  I'm a great admirer of yours, too, Mr. Nixon.  You are an unusual politician. We share a mutual idol -- "Six Crises" sounds like a page from Churchill.
Churchill, DeGaulle, Disraeli.  They all went through the pain of losing power.
What I think is ... they're cowards. Their opposition represents the cowardice of the Eastern Establishment.  They don't realize as you do, Mr. President, that the Communists only respect strength, and they will only negotiate in good faith if they fear the "madman," Richard Nixon.
No one understands! -- even my own men.  What do you think the Communists respond to?  Honesty, liberal guilt, soul-wringing crap, fathers on TV crying?  Hell no!  I understand the Communist mind, I've studied it for thirty years.  They grasp "realpolitik" better than any of us, right, Henry?
We have to entertain the possibility ...
Uh ... not really.  You mean on my knees?
Of course.
Yes, Mr. President.
That was Mr. Kennedy.
Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
Hiss was protecting his wife.  I've always believed that.
Make some money, Dick, prove yourself to the Wall Street crowd and let Goldwater and Rockefeller take the fall against Kennedy.
You need her, Dick -- in '60 she was worth five, six million votes.
They were throwing rocks, John, just rocks.  They don't think I feel ... but I feel too much sometimes.  I just can't let a whole policy get dominated by our sentimentality.
Mr. Nixon.
You're shittin' me.
Syracuse.
Oh yeah ... she really is ... wholesome.
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
Elvis I like, too.
Uh, is your mother ... still alive?
And we got the "big mo"!  We're back!
Of them.
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
I'll concede in the morning.
No, I'm not!  I'm finished.
If I stop ... there'll be no more talk of divorce?
No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.
I need you out there.  It won't be like last time.  The war's crippled the Democrats.  I can win ... We deserve it.  Yeah, it's ours, Buddy -- at last.  Nobody knows better than you.  Frank Nixon's boy.
Because ... I have to relax.
Thank you?  Dick, sometimes I understand why they hate you.
Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it.  I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court.
Write.  You know, a book.  I'm calling it "Six Crises."  It's a good thing, Rocky -- take some time off to write.
"Checkers" of course, Hiss, Ike's heart attack, Venezuela, the Kitchen Debate, and Kennedy.
Who else'd be in your truck.
How you been, Ellis?
I generally make a fresh pot ever week even if there's some left over.
How come're you doin that?
When did he die?
Nineteen zero and nine.
You can't stop what's comin. Ain't all waitin' on you.
No ID in her room?
I suppose. Though they was leavin' in a hurry.
Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
He's real all right.
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
I don't know. My mind wanders.
Yes ma'am, I do.
The old boy shot by the highway?
You figure him for a dope runner?
But you don't believe it.
So when was he here?
I don't know. He ought to...
Wasn't no bullet.
Well, Wendell, with all due respect, that don't make a whole lot of sense.
The Rangers and DEA are heading out to the desert this morning. You gonna join 'em?
Well then I guess I can skip it. Heavens to Betsy, Wendell, you already put me off my breakfast.
Okay. Two of 'em. Both had my father. It's peculiar. I'm older now'n he ever was by twenty years. So in a sense he's the younger man. Anyway, first one I don't remember so well but it was about meetin' him in town somewheres and he give me some money and I think I lost it. The second one, it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night.
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me?
Llewelyn!
I need to know that.
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.
Well then I'll tell her myself.
Yes I do.
Uh-huh.
Llewelyn?
What makes you say that?
No. This works better. With you gone and I don't have the money, he can't touch me. But I can sure touch him. After I find him I'll come and join you.
You expect him?
Screwgie.
In the truck.  I'll get it.
Huh? Airport or airstrip?
Just lightin' out for the territories, huh. Brother, I been there... Well...
I didn't mean nothin' by it.
I was just passin' the time.
I guess that passes for manners in your cracker view of things.
Sir?
Why would you be comin' back? We'll be closed.
You married into it.
...If that's the way you wanna put it.
They'll give you a wallop.
Let me have that one. Where's the nearest hardware store?
Okay.
You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
Okay.
Can I get my parking ticket validated?
Goodbye, Mr. Wells.
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
I don't think that's how I would describe him.
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
I been immobile.
The heroin. You don't have it.
Nam?
Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
No, Elden, I need to...
You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
That's right, you have the right to remain silent.
What about it?
You must be joking.
Oh, this is wonderful...
Do you know why I'm here?
Umm, I don't think that...
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
This is really awkward...
Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
Really? You've just described all of Southern California.
What?
He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
Are you and Larry happy?
Well, you are.
Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
He never told me anything about... that's unbelievable!
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
Oh, David... I'm sorry I caused you that much pain.
Well, first I thought Patina, and then the Ivy, but then I thought of somewhere a little more romantic. Like my place.
You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
STOP CALLING ME THAT! MY NAME IS NOT DAVID, AND IF YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE, YOU'RE MORE FUCKED UP THAN I THOUGHT YOU WERE!
Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...
George...
That is a skill!
Uh-huh.
What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
Worse.
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
So why'd you come to L.A.?
Man, that is love.
Listen, when someone does the kind of thing you did, you gotta do something in return. So, you stay with me until you find your David and live happily ever after. Okay?
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
Doctor David Ravell.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Shhh! I heard you the first time.
Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
Oh, he does that.  It's this silly game he plays. Half the people who know him call him George.
More than you know. Is there anything else?
Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
I don't follow...
You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
He told us it's in the Buick.
That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...
Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
So what the fuck's a Finn?
Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
They paid us half. They still owe us half...
There it is again. That lousy attitude that got us here in the first place. That "make a statement," do an end zone dance, shake your ass and sue everybody in sight attitude that's dragging this whole country down the drain.  They don't owe us shit, Wesley! WHEN YOU FINISH THE JOB, YOU GET PAID!! WE HAVEN'T FINISHED THE GODDAMN JOB!!
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
You need to remember who you're talking to...
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
Man, you have got to get some therapy.
Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore.
...who doesn't?
We know that...
I don't know, George...
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
That's not a bad idea. How many episodes before he comes back?
Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
Did Chloe crack?
No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
Mr. Campbell?
No doubt, brother - I figured as much back there in the restaurant. That's why I invited you out here for this advanced tutorial.
- but now it deposits you here.
- and share one of your graves.
No, they never did turn me into a toad.
Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas; must be my Hogwallop blood.
That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
Well if that is Pete I am ashamed of him.  The way I see it he got what he deserved - fornicating with some whore a Babylon.  These things-
Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar - it's just -
That ain't it!
Assa good idea, Pappy.
In any state.
Suckin' away.
Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.
We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
That's right, honey.
You -
Don't I know it.
We got but four days to get to that treasure! After that, it'll be at the bottom of a lake!
...I believe, unless I'm very much mistaken - see, we've been away for several years, uh...
Well, but Pete...
...With my added time for the escape, I don't get out now 'til 1987... I'll be eighty-four years old.
I am. Hur you?
Well that all depends. You boys do Negro songs?
Oh I remember 'em, colored fellas I believe, swell bunch a boys, sung into yon can and skedaddled.
But Pappy, they's inter-grated.
You got a maiden name, Daddy?
Great.
I'm not finished. I'll only be in port one week a month and when I'm here you'd never catch me playing daddy with you 'cause it's not who I am. Like I told you on the phone, you I'd be better off in that state school back in Virginia.
I don't know. That's just how it sounded. Well, I'll see you.
What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important.
I found them, pard, and read them myself, right after she did it!
That's not true, sir! I've changed a lot since I've been here! And I'm gonna make it, sir!
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.
Zack, don't!
Louder!
I said, come here!
But you knew right off what I was talking about, didn't you, Paula! Did you let that boy --
Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can.
Vietnam?
I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else?
Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.
What?
Great.
What did he do? Did he do anything that was different?
I haven't made up my mind.
What do you mean?
You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same!
Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her ears. But the rest is all wop.
Really?
No, and I'm not looking for one either.
You're a very pretty girl, Paula.
He didn't give you much choice.
I know who you are and what you want.
It sure was.
I don't want you to move.
What's stopping you?
Are those for me?
That's okay. I'm used to it.
Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay?
I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
Why?
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
He said he grew up poor?
The kid on the windy side of the baker's window. That's how he put it.
Sure it is, Sweet Pea, but he should've warned you 'scuzzy' female types about the 'Puget Dudes.' They'll tell you they're wearing a rubber but they've bit a little hole in the end.
My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died.  I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette.
She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.
She said it was up to me. If I don't, she'll go off and have the baby on her own somewhere.
Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out?
A woman and a little girl, both asleep upstairs.
Make her come out.  And when she does, that's when we gotta be careful.  She can't get out of this house.  She can't even think she can get out of this house.  We just keep them here and keep them quiet for forty-five minutes.  And I don't want  Joe Pesci here standing over them with his fat sweaty finger on the trigger.  That's a sure way for us to end up with two dead bodies and little puffs of smoke burning out of our heads up in Greenhaven.  So we're gonna seal the place up.  They wanna hole up in here?  Fine, we'll help 'em.  Make it impossible for them to leave.  Once they come out of that room.
That's right.
I can't just...
I don't know, she keeps screamin' the same thing over and over.
Are you gonna open the safe?
That's their problem.
FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
Raoul, what in God's name do we do if she has a gun?
What tables?  I've never seen him before.
They're coughing.
Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea?  Think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes!  The worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine.
Hey.
Do me a favor and don't talk.
Adios.
"Half?"  What did you, take a nap in math class?  Three people, three shares, one third.  Four point six six six repeating.
How many more do we have after this?
None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
Shoulda got an apartment.
Fuck her too.
Why did the chicken cross the road?
He won't even know who it was.
I was trying not to tell you...
Huh uh.
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?
They're hurting us, baby. Huey locked up. Bobby Seale running all over the country holding things together. Cy dead. Little Bobby... I don't recognize half the faces at meetings.
No! This is my private property. According to California law we have a constitutional right to bear arms.
Who? I mean besides the FBI?
Shit, I ain't doing nothing. White bread asks for cocaine, I take his money. Shit... you know... It was just a hustle.
Man... fuck you. Why you always bustin' my balls? All that high and mighty militant shit. I ain't doing nothing.
Man, fuck you!!!
Look this is bull...
You got it. Berkeley?
Heh, bunch of shines running around in dark caps waving their fists about some streetlight. They're loud, but they aren't dangerous,
We're like policing the police.
I assure you that we as the revolutionary vanguard are as serious about this as you are. We'll be prepared.
Wait a second there brother...
Mind if I ask you something? Why'd you put up with shit like that for someone else's war?
I'm talking about survival. Yours, mine, all of it. Outside and in. You got to do something for me. Staying alive might depend on it. The pigs are gonna try to infiltrate us and we're gonna let 'em. But their spy's gonna be our spy too. How about it?
Look... You... take her and get the hell out of here. I'll keep 'em busy.
No... wait, there's something else, something weird. I hear he's set up down at that warehouse on fifty deuce. He's talking big and living bigger.
Yeah... cop hit me...
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
You believe that?
It's alright.  I'm very happy for you.
Cheerful news to greet the morn.
I should have known... once I would have... I used to be wary... and today I watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her...
Lovely.
What unit?
First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?
That is a separate issue.
Sir.
Yes, sir.
Are you going to meet with him?
How can we end this madness?
He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body.
Which would force our delegates in Philadelphia to vote for independence.
When you have children, I hope you'll understand.
Yes, sir.
She got me at a more impressionable age.
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
Thank you.  Were I an orator, those are the exact words I would have spoken.
That's a damn long time...
I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles.
I'm sorry.
So you're going to try to keep Cornwallis in the South until then.
Yes, quite, but you should know that...
But what about Thomas?
For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do they part.
Earned.
Proud, priggish and competent.  A very bad combination in an adversary.
But it's already been two years and that's two more years.  The war could be over by then.
Quiet.
Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
Well...I guess not.
In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his turn.
Of course I will.
Because you promised.
I hate that smell.
Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven?
Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--
Don't bother. I'm coming home.
Well, maybe I----
I like rock and roll. No...I guess that's too mild. I love it. Since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music I can really hear. And since my wife died...I dunno, some- times a little rock and roll fills up night. Not always, but sometimes.  One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope your time here will be a happy one.
The place we're going is on the other side of that.
I'm not climbing that.
Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
You keep saying that.
No buts! Accept what's done, Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call...but not a word about tonight.
Why, saved a little girl from being unhappy...that's all. Drink up, Louis!
According to what Mr. Crandall says, the road's a lot more dangerous than the operation. Church will be just the same. Well--almost the same--and we won't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn Orinco trucks.
I know what you just said. Ellie, clear your place.
Yes, I guess I do.
AnaMaria!  Have you seen Gibbs?  I need to put together --
Mr. Gibbs, organize a cleaning detail -- you and Cotton.  I want every inch of the Pearl spic-and- span and ship-shape!
You left me on a desert island -- what worse can you do?
Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
And he's got Old Bill's courage. A curse on him, and you!
Then why aren't you eating?
Aye.  And not a bit of it any use to us, only hoarded.  But it will drive us no longer.
Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
Boy overboard!
I can't breathe.
Commodore, please!
I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
I saved your life; now you've saved mine.  We're square.
So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
Yes, the rum is gone.
Exactly.
Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to.  All I need is a crew.
And you've got that, have you?
What?  He never told me that.
How did he get off the island?
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
This must be some important boat.
By remembering that I serve others, not only myself.
Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
Because you're a pirate.
My business, Will.  As for your business -- one question, or there's no use going.  This girl -- what does she mean to you?  How far are you willing to go to save her?
Commandeer.  We're going to commandeer a ship.  Nautical term.
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
My father -- was not -- a pirate!
It's the right way.
Yes.
But I've seen a ship with black sails.
Still --
Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
Come with me, Susan.  I want to show you something.
It's ready now, I know it is.
Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control.
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
Consideration?
Poppy, this is not the time!
Not that.
That might work.
Poppy, order the trucks from the Gary plant.  And we're going to need a containment crew.
In the meantime, why don't you find something useful for Dr. Bright to do.
Wait, wait, can I at least have his body?
Why don't you just shove it up your ass!  Haw-haw!
What did he want?
That's the guy?
Well, you got another problem.
The replicators?
I think that either you're going to give them to him or he's going to make you give them to him.
Mr. Sim, watch out!  O'Brien escaped and could be on his way!
So, I guess it worked.
And if we evacuate, what do you want to do with O'Brien?
Wellie well, Dr. Bright.  You're just in time.
Really?  What have you been doing?
The big house.
And for cleaning up oil spills.
We'll see?  What does that mean?
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
I don't know.
But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
I'm a plastic man!  A plastic man!
What has happened to you is nothing compared to what is going to happen to Calumet City if we don't hurry.
This is what I deserve for trying to protect the world from a madman and his mercenary physicists?
Yeah.  Old times.
The nanobot... it's not here...
It's still inside me?
On the counter.
The same thing I suppose.
God, what a fight that was.
I guess they do.
I'm real touched.  Now get your Sunday's on.  We're going for a ride.
Forget it, pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer.
Oh yeah?
He believes that the second nanobot should be ready for testing by now.
You won't.  That's why you're whispering.
You don't seem to understand that this one's different. He has brains.
Goodbye, Stew
I don't mind her if you don't.
Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.
I know but that was news. This is blackmail and I don't like blackmail.
Yeah, I haven't figured out the plot yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village.
I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler. I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, that you feel this way. I was in hopes that you would like me. I'm not the burglar that you think I am. After all, we're married. I think the thing to do is to kiss and make up - Mother.
I don't need any new ties. I've got another tie - I've got another one besides this one. And it's a pip, too. There's only one thing wrong with it. You know what that is?  It has a little weakness for gravy, and once in a while it leans a little toward ketchup. Of course that's only in its weaker moments. When you move down to my place, I'll show it to you.
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house
Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now
You wear them of course, silly.
Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
Sure - my pal on the paper. She's subbing for the society editor tonight.
I see.
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
Your house?
Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to.
Is that so?
We were classmates.
You're always picking on me. It took me three hours to get those little gadgets in those holes, and you screw it up in a minute. Hey, look!
Do you call yourself a reporter?
Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.
What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?
You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.
My play.
Sure.
Your valet, sir.
A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here!
Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.
Remember, she's a Schuyler.
Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
Say, what kind of a pal are you? You're not going to leave me flat?
Oh, you dyed one and washed the other. Well! You certainly look good.
Hello, Stew.
Okay.
Yes - and I'd love it.
Conrad.
It'll be ready in a minute.
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
Go?! Wait a minute - that's a great story! Newspaper reporter was forcibly ejected from Schuyler Mansion, and
Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut.
Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars, eh? and there are letters...
Oh, my marriage to Anne. Now Mrs. Schuyler, we don't want you to go to any trouble about that. We just want the usual blessings, that's all.
Smythe! Well, well, well! With a Y , huh?  Congratulations! What a small world. Brothers under livery. Shake!  Now, as a Smith to a Smythe
Well sir, I'll show you.
Yes sir.
Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
Yes.
It doesn't matter.
We're in Pleasantville?
I can't go out there. How can I go out there?
She's crying.
Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said that if things keep going the way they are, I might be seeing that promotion sooner than I thought.
But your sister is a fine young woman and she would never do anything for us to be concerned about.
No I'm not sweetie.
Where are you gonna go?
Oh yeah.
Now don't you think she looks just as pretty in color? Don't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her?
"Changes."  And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things.  Did you hear about Bill Miller?
Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
Rain.
Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home."
Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
Very well. Let the record show that the defendants have answered in the affirmative to all the charges.
Okay--that's enough!
Hello Mr. Simpson.
Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.
Owns the hardware store.
Play along?
They don't have that kind of potential.
Nothing.
Yeah ...
No. She really liked you.
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
I told you. I'm like positive.
And you're sure about this?
Real rain?
It was a prop for the school play ...
I like it too.
You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone for years ... You pour your heart into it ... This is a privilege you know.  I don't think I better talk about this right now.
I had nothing to do with that.
Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
Why don't you just take me back without it?
I'm going on trial tomorrow?
Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm fine. I just ... Had to get home early.
You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors.
Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
Oh--what's the point, Bud?
Forget about that!
You're gonna keep painting aren't you?
Just a little--You know.
Well here I am.
A miracle.
You know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation.
So you can't talk to me?
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
Somewhere in Utah.
What's the listing?
Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.
Why?
I don't think I'm going to the party.
So it's ok if I bring her.
I'm trying to be your friend.
No.
-- do you think you'll ask her out?
Call me later.
There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
No.
Yeah? So what are you doing, then?
No.
Yeah. And looking at myself in the mirror. Do you wanna know what I look like?
No.
...yeah.....
...yeah....well you have me now.
Can I ask you a question?
You have trouble, financial trouble?
See the thing is I could make it really easy on you -- I already have your credit card number, your information, address and stuff. This is so awkward asking like this, I'm sorry --
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
I saw a picture of you.
It's ok. That's ok. How long have you worked with Elizabeth?
Ok.
About six months.
Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
Yeah, no, I see --
Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?
What happened?
Yes? I'm trying.
Yes no not really.
I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
Yeah.
Ok.
Lena?
No. What do you mean? BARRY I just wanted to know. When was the last time you had a boyfriend?
I think maybe over a hundred.
So here we go.
I'm fine, I have your work number.
Did you do it?
The police are on their way.
It's....confidential, the call, my information is private.
...3407 2627 3444 8095 expiration 05/04.
And your name?
And your Social Security number.
I thought I was just gonna be connected to talk to a girl - that's fine, ok, I'm sorry, it's, um.....818....
YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. MY LOVE WAS HURT, SHE GOT HURT. I AM IN LOVE WITH HER AND YOU HURT YOU AND YOU ARE GONNA FUCKING GET HURT. YOU DON'T TOUCH HER, I LOVE HER.
You better watch your mouth, cunt, you're gonna get hurt.
That's that.
Maybe you said that because you're hungry.....
I don't like the way I am sometimes.  Can you help me? WALTER Barry, I'm a dentist, what kind of help do you think I can give you?
I know that. Maybe you know other doctors?
What is this, man?
What are you doing?
I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.
Seriously.
You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go.
You can't just stay in your house.
It's....whatever....that's not cool.
What's the problem?
Are you sure?
It's not bad, it's ok.
So...did my brother call you?
I have no idea what he's doing then. I'm sorry that didn't work out.
It's fine.
I'm sorry. You're right.
At your service, Count.
"One day, Fanchon was visited by a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting follicles..."
Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?
Mother's not half so blind as you.
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
What did you do? Bribe one of the guards?
But you've no right to publish! Behind my back, without my sanction!
And --?
But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine.
One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties!
Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
Mightier than the sword indeed.
Because your writing continues, unchecked.
What on earth would that require?
Go to hell!
Then it must've been love --
We inspected the body, Marquis. She died a virgin.
Of course.
Playing dress-up with cretins? That sounds like a symptom of madness; not its cure.
It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind.
Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
Shut down?
But he's one among some two hundred wards --
A practical man, sir. Given the Marquis' unusual tastes, a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent.
And --?
Of course.
-- a veritable freak show for tourists and curiosity seekers. Charenton is a sanatorium; she is not a circus. The theater is henceforth closed. As for your avowed friend -- playwright emeritus of the madhouse --
What could cause a tincture like this?
It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
You'd suffer in her stead?
No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again.
Gibberish, my friend. He rants and he raves --
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them?
You demand a lot from your readers, you do.
It's only been described to me. In your books.
Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --
How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --
No. But tell him I would.
Oh, but I am!
It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
Very much.
Am I?
Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
Mr. Welles certainly is a caution
I can't
But I am That's the killer, honey.
Do you?
Elegant words, sir, when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. In your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock. I learned at the knee of the master.
Hope you don't mind my popping in--
You oughta lay off him -- he is the p-p-president, after all.
Pops
Nailed us, hub? The crazy old man and his whore.
There's a different between want and
You will not walk out on me
No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
And how do you feel when you are lied to?
Then make them up! You're drunk and you're angry.
We're using-
Can I talk to Hearst?
All right! Enough! I've heard this from Schaefer and RKO. I've heard it from everyone--
Right-
I'm not fucking with Hughes. That shit-kicker would kill us dead, baby. Just like Jean Harlow
Listen ... I've got it! It came to me like a thief in the night! Pure inspiration! Total magnificence!
Why her?
She was . . . innocent
He loves in his own way. On his conditions. Because those are the only conditions he has ever known.
And what does he see?
Good?! Good?! Words fail you at last! It's terrific! Now I'll have to do some shaping, of course, and some of the scenes aren't exactly . . . exactly . . .
But it's not a great syllable
Uh huh.
I just can't . . see it anymore
Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.
I'm sorry.
Mank, sit down. You missed the opening of the new picture but I'll go back--
What does this have to do with--?
Hell, I know how it ends.  Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
Not one of them today has what you had, Miss Davies. Not one of them.
Of course, of course. How can we be of service?
And we gotta be clear here. I need the negative and every existing print.
Again.
CITIZEN KANE
The magazines are one thing -- but Hedda! Why did we have to let her come?!
It's just that my movie is so-
I really think you're
It was fun, wasn't it?
Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?
You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok?
Just come by to wish you luck.  Need anything?
Ok, champ.
He's an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Why's he make it so hard on himself? He comes to me, I can make it easier for him.
Believe what you want.
I want to believe you, LaMotta.
You won and was robbed! You didn't do nothin' wrong.
Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
Where you been?
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
No, I just told you what happened.
I did keep an eye...
Then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? You and him been friends a long time.
What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
I tell you what. You hit me here.  Sugar Ray hits me here.  I can't tell the difference. I just fight.
I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
Ya hear, Joey? She thinks this face is cute? Hey, whatcha doin' now? You wanna go for a ride?
Can you see it?
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
Do what I say.
Who asked you?
But, Jake, I was just...
No, I'm not.
In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?
Look at this, all of a sudden everybody's a fuckin' Romeo around here. Did you see the way she was lookin' at him?
What?
Yeah, what?
Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
That he's got a pretty face.
You're hurting my arm.
I went to the movies.
What'd you see?
I am answering...
He should.
All right, I'll try. See you later.
Excuse me for living.
No, you're his wife.
This is L. B. Jefferies, a friend of Tom's. Who am I talking with?
This could go off in a month -- or an hour.
Didn't you take it to the crime lab?
I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.
Go ahead, Doyle -- tell me he's an unemployed magician -- amusing the neighborhood with sleight-of-hand.
You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
For instance?
We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where.
Well -- what good is his information?!! It's a second-hand version of an unsupported statement by the murderer himself -- Thorwald! Anybody actually see the wife get on the train?
Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.
I can't do it even if he's gone.
I can hear myself starting out. "Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --"  He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes.
Well, in the garage, back home, we --
Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.
Where'd they take Lisa?
Maybe you won't need it. I'll run it down, Jeff.
If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long.
For getting rid of that cast.
I'll send you some comic books.
I'll -- I'll get married. Then I'll never be able to go anywhere.
Who are you?
You've got a hormone deficiency.
Her father loading up the shotgun?
She's only perfect.
How did you know!
Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
I'll watch the alleyway -- in case it goes that way.
There's something buried there.
What?
I handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in New Jersey asleep for the winter.
You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
Goodnight, you idiot.
Hasn't been any big demand for tickets.
I wanted to, Jeff.  Oh!
Tired?
That's what I'm afraid of.  Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard? 
Let's not talk any more nonsense, huh?
Well, they'd be very stylish in Finland -- just before you froze to death. Begin to get the idea?
I mean what I said.
All right -- but what's he doing now?
I never saw him ask her for advise before.  But she volunteered plenty.
We'll agree they saw a woman -- but she wasn't Mrs. Thorwald. -- That is, yet.
The same.
Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
Huh?
Well, -- if there was one less thread this way --  -- and two less that way --  -- I might give up bachelorhood.
In the whole courtyard, only one person didn't come to the window. 
Two minutes.
What's eating you, Judy?  You want him alive?
What?
I like you, you know?
Smashed the front door.
You can't protect me.
You make any sandwiches?
I don't know.  First I thought it was Jim but--
Open it.
Come with me, John.
Plato.
In my mother's drawer.
You remember me?
What?
They're still there!
No.  In the morning.
My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
They think you told the police on them.  They--who's in there?
I'm here.  Shut up.
We'll take it!
Boy, I'm blind as a bat!  You got a match?  I'm going to break my neck in here.  Where are you?
Here.
I shot at one of them.
All right, darling.
Goodbye, dear.
But I am involved!  We're all involved, Mom!  A boy was killed! I don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen!
Do I have to spell it out?
Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
Listen--
Bully for you.
Now that's true!
Yeah.  So where's the high school?
I'm sorry I treated you mean today. You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the kids.  Nobody acts sincere.
If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
Your lips are soft when you kiss.
See, we're very modern.
He needed you, maybe.  So do I.
Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere.
Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?
Talk to them!  Heavens!
Hi.
Do you think your father means that?
Would you like to go home if we can arrange it?  Did you notify the parents?
No.  Why?
I didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.
GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
Radio said negative five.
No, no --
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
No, no, no. Be like you want to be.
You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas.
Nick, no --
You told him about Nick's letters.
They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
Get your own room.
There went my... damn... well, doesn't seem like security's all that switched... Ash, shit, this mustache is starting to fall off. I gotta fix this thing --  -- drink this for me.
Shh, now. Rest now. Two years, Nick. You haven't had cranberry buns in two years.
I don't know...
We need to find a way to make me part of it.
Is there any way you could get into his truck?
Well. I'm going home.
Merry Christmas.
I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!
I shared his cell!
What?
Samantha.
Hey.
And which of these doors here lead up to the security level?
Why not.
Shut the fuck up. You play what your girlfriend plays. Ashley's going in with you. You talk to her, otherwise you don't talk to nobody. You walk the room as many times as you want, but the second you come out, I want to know the run of the place.
...never... tried...
Nothing... I promise-nothing...
You need six.
Six men means six guns.
No way.
I'm no threat without a gun.
No, you're not.
Because down there this is money. Up here this is heat.  You wanted Vegas quality, I brought it to you. You wanted Vegas press, I gave it to you. But guys, please, guys... I can't get you Vegas profits... till one of ya does some spirit dance and does something about this snow.
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
Acid-chewer.
And Monster... he was talking with the casino manager. Nick was talking to him.
My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
Fuckin' freezing.
Hi, Nick.
I been in Iron Mountain for two years, truck driver. I do one more crime, I'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. You want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? I want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
Where the hell's Gabriel?
DROP THE GUNS! NOW!
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --
I promise you, I didn't know!
There are monsters...  ...in the gelatin...
Oh, man --
Ain't there yet.
Fuck your hot chocolate, Rudy.
Thought you hated Sidnaw.
Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
I don't know, I've seen the business world.
Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...
Tell Ashley... I...
...for Christmas...
Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley?
I'M NOT NICK!
I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
No. She was from Ladora Heights.
Really? Who's your P.O.?
Daddy, I got an idea. Now just hear it out. I know you don't like to use any of the boys on these jobs, but technically, Vic ain't one of the boys. He's been gone for four years. He ain't on no one's list. Ya know he can handle himself, ya know you can trust him.
Bullshit.
And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up?
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
Well, let's go get it. We also gotta get rid of all those cars. It looks like Sam's hot car lot outside.  You stay here and babysit Orange and the cop.  You two take a car each, I'll follow ya. You ditch it, I'll pick you up, then we'll pick up the stones. And while I'm following you, I'll arrange for some sort of a doctor for our friend.
This better not be some Freddy joke.
No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well.
Me and Mr. White?
Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.
He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy.
Whatever. Just throw in your dollar, and let's move.  See what I'm dealing with here. Infants. I'm fuckin' dealin' with infants.
When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.
You gonna put it away?
Who gives a damn?
What for?
Don't ask me that.
He don't believe in it.
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
I said: "Are you gonna bark all day, dog, or are you gonna bite."
It's a surprise.
Joe.
When I was coming down here, I was playin' it. And "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia" came on. Now I ain't heard that song since it was big, but when it was big, I heard it a million-trillion times. I'm listening to it this morning, and this was the first time I ever realized that the lady singing the song, was the one who killed Andy.
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.  Is it bad?
This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.
You even doubt it? I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up! I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm. But those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.  You haven't thought about this?
What's done is done, I need you cool. Are you cool?
What's wrong with it?
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.
What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one?
What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.
I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit.
Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up.
Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're on our own. Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em.
Oh, I don't doubt is was quite beautiful -
Of course.
Maybe he did.
All I can get out of her is she don't care about livin'.
Yeah. Keep a closer eye on her --  And him. Shootin' going on, we'll never find Lednov.
It doesn't matter who they are.
Course I can't. I'll give you a lift to the first ranch.
You'll have to drive -- except down hill.
No, Ma'am, we can't. We can get a roof and a fire and maybe Mrs. Wyatt knows something about taking care of sick people.
I suppose it is.
You should know. She's in your dream.
Will she be dark or fair?
What does a man usually tell a girl?
I can't help how I think. You're trained a certain way when you're a kid and you can't change.
Why?
It wouldn't happen to be this...
I don't see no sense to makin' people leave town if they don't want to leave.
The thing to do is stick to rabbits.
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
Can I have my gun back?
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
Maybe you shoulda killed him.
There's only two of them now.
You'll get your share. Go on. I don't want you around.
I like it.
Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
Go ahead.
And we're running out of that.
No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
Where is he?
Up the trail.
What for?
Did someone say I wasn't nice?
No. We're not stayin' --
From A to Z. All you have to do now is figure out what they mean put together in words.
Then if they wasn't alive, how can they be an animal?...
Sure.
It's a long ways yet.  I figure we ought to camp. She's tired.
Thanks, Steve.
Well, actually, we've never met officially, but I bumped into you at the cafeteria and you were so sweet. I said, "I'm sorry," and you said, "Watch it, white bitch, or I'll put my size eight in your ass." I thought how cool. I wear a size eight, too. Anyway, this is my best friend, Cindy.
Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
Okay.
It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him!
No, he lost the house after the stock market crash.
He's so brave.
I don't know. He was right behind us. Wait here. I'll be right back.
Okay.
Wait, I'm just about to tell you the best part.
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon.
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
Actually, I was going to say let me have your computer if you die.
There's something I want to share with you too. Here, smell this.
What, you think I did this to myself?
She killed herself a week before he died.
That means more screen time for us.
Yeah, I broke my fall.
Nah, I need a place to stay. So how do you like being in college?
Let's start with some rhythm. Sway back and forth like this.
Yeah, you feel that? Now put it all together.
Uh, uh.
That turned out to be a good thing! It's gonna make smuggling a whole lot easier. Remember that weed? I'm about to get paid.
Yes, it was reported, but never substantiated.
Are these all the subjects?
Look, whatever you say, kid, but the more they're hurtin', the more they need a squirtin', if you know what I mean.  Ooh, I like her.
And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
Would you please focus?
Fine.  What's all this stuff?
After dinner, you and I will take shifts throughout the night. I don't want to chance miss anything.
What is it, Dwight?
Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
The keys. She took the keys.
Oh, I couldn't do that.
What do you know about it?!... Listen, the ghost is too powerful. The only chance we have is to use this machine.  I need you to go get the others and meet us upstairs.
Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.
Washington is full of cornpone country pussy -- just ask Jesse Jackson.
Me? Grace? Okay -- Dear God --
I am Tom Green, I am Tom Green. Daddy want some sausage, sausage. Daddy want some sausage...
Get out?! What does it say?
What happened?
You said you hated him.
Well... he was an asshole... but he didn't deserve to die!
Always the dentist.
I certainly did not.
Is there a killer loose?
Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
Because it's the rules!
Oh Mom...
Hold on...  Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...
I can't believe I thought my own mother was a murderess!
MISTY SUTPHIN, GET IN THIS CAR!!
Oohhhh, Eugene!
...People who don't mind their own business.
Who's voice was it, Dottie?
It was her! Beverly Sutphin! Sittin' right there!  I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!!
NO I DON'T, YOU BITCH!
Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company. I understand you're having problems with obscene calls.
Socially... I'll have a beer.
Just a boy. He's picking me up this morning.
We all have bad nights. 
Yes, I did. It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning.
If you wouldn't mind...  It was on sale.
Yes, but I lent it...
No...  I don't have room in my kitchen...
Certainly not!
We have mice! I mean it, Ralph! I saw one!
Yes. She bought my sister's business.
That's what she told you. I looked it up at the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.
You can't tell.
It's the last door at the end of this hall.
Let's get out of here.
No. It's my father -- I wanted to talk to you -- you wrote about cures --
You come to me with some wild story about her being in danger - naturally I want to know what kind of danger. I want to know where she is.
She could use a hundred dollars.
She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
Thank you.
What is it?
I did her hair.
Drink your milk.
You've never believed a word I told you about Mr. August.
Look, Mary, now that I know you better, I think I can be more frank with you. I don't believe you. I still can't understand the reason for such a wild tale. It's like some of Jacqueline's stories.
What things? Why?
It may make very fine poetry, Mr. Hoag, but it doesn't make good sense.
This is the part of New York I love. It is old. It has memories. If you listen, the houses will speak to you. Walt Whitman...Edna St. Vincent Millay... Eugene O'Neill...in their time they've all lived here.
We could tell him.
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
You will die.
But it's a small room, Jason.
It's because of Jacqueline  I can't go on looking for her --
And you believe that?
It's here, too.
My dear fellow, it's neither your business to ask, nor mine to tell.
You don't expect me to do that do you?
No other reason  no woman not the little Miss Gibson?
Yes, Miss Gibson. I've come to take you to your sister.
I don't know.
You're very flippant and perhaps wise, but not wise enough to see the truth, Louis.
Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.
Why?
It will make you unhappy to find Jacqueline. It would put her in danger --- great danger --
Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
Of course.
It won't hurt.
Oh. Well, please sit down.
No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really... irrelevant. How do you like being married?
Did you know that if you shut someone up in a room, and the only clock he has reference to runs two hours slow for every twenty-four, that his body will eventually adjust to that schedule? Simply because the mind honestly perceives that twenty-six hours are twenty-four, the body follows. And then there are sections of time. Your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality . For instance, when I was twelve, I had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship. Now, I'm not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time, but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to, and then were crystallized in, that eleven minutes.
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
Younger.
I feel like they do.
What?
They are looking at you. Ann, you are truly breathtaking. I don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. Men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. And those that don't or can't resent you. And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.
You're in therapy?
Hah! No, I'm not. Actually, I used to be, but the therapist I had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems. Of course, I lied to him constantly, so I guess I can't hold him totally responsible...
Oh, see, I meant someone you've had sex with. That's part of the theory.
Why not?
Like what?
Like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. Anything I can think of.
No, not to me, for me, for the camera.
I'm sorry this came up.
It's not my place to tell you these things, Ann. You have to find out by yourself or from John directly. You have to trust me on this.
What will you do when the money runs out?
Ann Bishop Millaney.
You are married, correct?
Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?
I know. Deep down, I know that. It just bothers me, when I have feelings or impulses that she has.
I fantasized about you.
Yes.
How come?
God, I m so mad at him!!
You should be. He lied to you. So did Cynthia.
That's very flattering.
So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?
Like maybe a big part?
I'm just going to keep asking until you answer. I'm sure there's plenty of tape.
I don't care.
All right!! All right!! You want to know? You want to know how I feel? I feel ashamed. Is that what you wanted to hear?
You're not answering me.
I'm okay. It's okay.
I called you Tuesday at 3:30 and they said you weren't in. Do you remember where you were?
I ate by myself.
I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.
What?
If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over.
God, no.
Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know?
Well, kind of recently, I guess. But not too recently.
I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
Not really.
Do you feel there is more progress to be made?
I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too.
Ann, you always underestimate me.
He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
Because I never got around to it.
Apparently.
I can't believe you did that!!
So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
I'm Cynthia Bishop.
Do I know you?
The extrovert.
I don't understand. Why did you want to come here? I mean, I can't imagine Ann painted a very flattering portrait of me.
Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?
Yes.
Just a moment.
When I was fourteen.
Live, or in a photograph or film of some sort?
He said that my hand felt good.
Different.
Right.
I'm intrigued.
Oh.  Well, when, then?
It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
No.
Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.
Did he put you up to this?
Who?
I can't believe I let him stay in my house. Right under my nose. That deviant fucker was right under my nose and I didn't see him.
How about for five hundred?
A bonfire, probably.
She held up very well.
What do you mean?
God, you need help.
I need help? Whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes, Graham? Not me, buddy. You're the fucking nut. Now show me those tapes.
Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
All right, jesus.
Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc...  ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out.
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
Sure.
You're the one who found the bodies?
Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
Rollo! How'sa boy? I was just thinking about you.
Yeah? What do I do then?
OK, Rog. See you at ten.
IT'S TIME FOR BYE-BYES IT'S BEEN A GREAT DAY THANKS A HEAP NOW IT'S TIME FOR EVERYONE TO GO TO SLEEP
BREAKING OUT
Fools!
Time to check with Flavors.
As Janet's parents this should be really easy.  Your last clue... Mental Instability.  You have thirty seconds.
Of course!  D.T.V.'s most popular Hospital series featuring those perennial favorites, Cosmo and Nation McKinley. Neuro-specialists par excellence ...if you'll pardon my French. I recommend you send Brad to them for treatment!
On the contrary.  He wants to see your ratings soar.  He needs a woman of exceptional desirability.
I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
Well, Betty, there are many ways that the spider may catch the fly...
Bert brought them over from Europe.  They had a very popular series together.  It's still rerun in a lot of countries.  You must have seen them in 'Dentonvale?'
Sounds like my husband.  He never came back either.  At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.
Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
Yeah, well.  Here, Betty.  I just came to give you this.
But I don't need treadment.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
TENDERNESS AND INNOCENCE IN DENTON`
I'd forgotten.
Could you tell us a little about it?
Who?
Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
It's...
Your father doesn't like Mexicans.
Janet!  Where's that lovely dress I made you?
There are countless people in this world who believe they're happy.
You've got a really tight team around you.  And everybody needs you!
I can't wait to begin on him. Really, Bert, I don't know what we'd do without you!
HE LEAVES YOU SMOKING...
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
Gary.
Bottle.
Spray and Wash. That's the one.
In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
Great. You look great.  You both do.
Hi.  Maya's in the kitchen.
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
Sure is tasty.
How about the new ending? Did you like that?
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
It's her birthday tomorrow. And I don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay? It'll just take a second. She's right off the freeway.
Um... seventy... something.
Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass.
Thanks, Jack. So do I.  Here we are.
I told you. Filet and salmon.
I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
What color is it supposed to be?
Want some?
We head north, begin the grape tour up there, make our way south so the more we drink the closer we get to the motel.
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
She what?  When?
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
Well, she is cute.
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?
I'm fine!
Don't you see how Maya's looking at you? You got her on the hook. Reel her in! Come on, let's rachet this up a notch. You know how to to do it. Here.  Drink some agua.
Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system. Congratulations. Mission accomplished.
Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.
Um... not exactly. But I've been honest. I haven't told her I'm available. And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. Besides...
Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
Can you give me some room here?
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
What's happening?
What's up?
Neither could I. I think it's Bukowski.
Good thing you have a voice-over career.
You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
Quite a week.
I feel like driving.
I'll pay for it.
She got anything good?
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, I'd say you're right on the money.
Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.
Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
Good. So did I.
You too.
It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Universally rejected. Strike three.
Then buy a bottle and go outside.
Well, I've come to never expect greatness from a Cab Franc, and this one's no exception. Sort of a flabby, overripe --
Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
Huh.
She doesn't answer me either.
No dad!
I heard them Morgan.
You got two minor league home run records don't you?
Curse and stuff.
I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone. Is that understood?
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
We have to go in the basement.
From what?
How do they know it's over?
It needs batteries.
We can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this.
Don't do it.
They tell you everything in this book.
I just asked his name.
You're scaring your sister.
Pinned? What does that mean?
It's like War of the Worlds.
Don't worry.
Your next water ain't for three days.
It was my fault.
McKendrick.
Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie.
I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
Where's Jake?
Is he alive?
I just came out to say goodbye.
This is a brutal land.
I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?
Yup. The whole rig. I don't care much about the rest, but I surely will miss that bay. Least they didn't kill me. That was right considerate, I thought. They were laughing when they left me. Thought it was real funny. I walked for a little while but there was no use, so I gave it up. Figured it was just bad luck.
It's a town...
It never is. But he's my brother.  We're going to California together. But first we're going to stop in Silverado and see our sister. And I can't show up there with a story like this.
Why?
The other guy drew first.
I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
Is there a place in town that takes... my kind?
That ain't right.
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
Oh that's just fine. Where were you when Ma and Daddy needed you? It's too late, Mal. Now you finally show up and all you can think of is to get yourself killed.
What's stopping you?
Lucky.
He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you've got to take care of it.
I heard that too.
Let's talk about that.  I'm looking for some men.
Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. But I think I'll keep looking for mine.
So we understand each other?
Why'd you go into business with him?
Is that what he said? Well, he figured it okay this time.
You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone.  I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.
It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
Difficult.  I'm difficult.
You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
-- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
I'll walk you out.
Simone does not control my destiny.
Who else?  It's always Simone's idea.
I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
Do what?
That sounds wonderful.  How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
No... it's life.
Well, here I am.  You look pretty today.  Red suits you.
Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.
Of course.
Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what you do to Simone.  I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Please put your clothes on
That's a good question.  As Nietzsche said, "Whenever a man strives long and hard to appear someone else..."
Clyde.
For you.  I want you to know, Simone appreciates you all working for scale.  But why am I thanking you? Simone can thank you herself.  She insisted on speaking with you before filming begins.  She's on the line now.
Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!
There's... a wall between you --
How did the wall get there?
I can't explain it to you now -- you'll see when it's all put together.  Anyway, we got it a couple of takes ago.  Let's move on.
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
I need flesh and --
An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
I know you'll do it, Dad.  You're Viktor Taransky.
Me too.
I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
Really?  Who?  Where do you meet them?  In a chat room?  How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?
Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
Precisely.
Really?  Too bad.
Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
An insanity defence.
I remember when the Echo had class -- the paper that could bring down governments.
I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed.  It gets cold out here at night.
Abduction?
I want to see her.  Unless you show me Simone live and in person I show these pictures to the authorities.
Don't you?
Maybe he's talking to himself.
Sometimes you have to tell a small lie to get to the bigger truth.  As for a photo -- if you can't do it, I know twelve million people who can.
Taller?  What?
You could play the lead.
You know what I'm talking about.
What, Anna? What did I do? What's made you so sad?
Goodnight, sweetheart.
Why?
Yes.
You haven't told bedtime stories before?
What?
When?
Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... And then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. No one asked them. It's just gone...
You have nice red in your cheeks now.
I definitely won't.
So who moved it?
Yeah.
Oh my God.
Yes.
Dead people.
Dead people?
You think I'm a freak?
They were the ones who hanged everybody.
You're a stuttering Stanley!
It's our pleasure.
Superstition.
Two.. maybe three days.
Nope.
You... think... I... stole... your... fancy shoes? I... wouldn't... be... caught... dead in 'em.
Fuck you.
Slut.
I happen to be a professional.
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.
You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
Hell, no. But you missed a damn good sermon. "You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord."
Nah. We still got Billy Bob.
Let me get this straight... we're talking about manure?
Sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before I rolled it.
It harvests! It threshes! Look at these blades.
"-- an AXE!"
Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it.
This is his room... isn't it?
I --
I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
Name something.
Still trying to figure it out myself.
Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?
You never had trouble communicating before.
You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
Don't you see? Whatever's going on... I'm part of it.
Can't help it, Suze... family sticks together...
CARL??? Carl did this?!!
What'll we do?
Bill, we need to talk!
I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
Okay.
I see. It's like as if he's going in a pattern. Is that what you're saying, Bill?
A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
All sound reasons for matrimony.
Why? You have a bowling date?
Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
They're both a challenge.
Seriously?!?
Would I lie to you?
I forget to tell you. I'm running blocker for four hundred cases of illegal brew.
Hey...
Trucker coffee. It's three times stronger. Good for a hundred miles. That, a coupla perks, and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound.
Uh-oh.
Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
And?
You sure do.
See.
Our asses gonna be in a sling if we get caught.
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
Pull your hammer back, Smokey's coming at you.
Do I have a choice?
I'm cucumber cool.
What's that, pardner?
My handle's Smokey Bear and I got you by the tail.
Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
See, running Coors Beer east of Texas is what bothers me. It makes me a bootlegger.
Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits.
Where the hell are you?
Now, you just find him, son.
Congratulations. You just became a legend maker.
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
You have a butler working that floor?
No, no, no. We've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now. The security team is only present to preserve floor integrity, due to the roof access.
And a very bad gamble.
Have them mobilized. I'll phone security and have the elevators locked down and stairwells secured. We need to keep Israel sequestered in that penthouse.
Get a coroner's estimate too.  -- Miss, I've been transferred and I was disconnected. No one is answering and I need someone from security to pick up that line. It's urgent.
No.  I'm going over there. You take the car from there, get out to the lake.
-- he was wearing one of our jackets.
Thass' right.  I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.
Shoot, I appreciate that man.
I said I got his machine.
I am. Yeah.
Bullshit it is. I said, about as loud as I could say it, "no jail time for my guys."
I don't have to do shit! Which includes cooperating any further with these motherfuckers until I get what I want!  Alright, fuck it, if we gotta hand 'em somebody from our end and they're being hard-ons about it -- make it Hugo, him I don't mind. He needs that regimented thing that prison provides --
Possibly. Acosta is pure mercenary. And a million dollar hit fee will draw some huge flies. But forget about Sparazza's money for a moment and remember, there's no shortage of those who want Israel killed and no shortage of cash to do just that...
-- Brought against Sparazza by Israel's mother Laverne who was nineteen at the time. They had a brief affair which Israel was the by- product of.
-- he's doing it then, huh --
-- okay, g'head --
A million flat.
Fuckin' thrilled t'hear it. So the scout, the sitdown, y'musta felt it from 'em then huh?
-- good, then all you got to be is grateful.
I feel like I know you girl. I feel like I've known you forever.  You gonna lemme see your scars?
C'mon, I say we bounce now, kick it for a lil' bit, play some craps.  ...Maybe spend the night?
Jus' keep doin' y'damage girl, keep these mafuckas off my as--
No?  Who am I, then?
Who, here, could possibly care what you want?  At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction.  They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you?
Listen --
Kelvin, if you see anything unusual...
Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message.
I'm not sure.  It started with Gibarian.  He locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door.  He covered the video lens. Obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown.  I don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there.  By this time, we were getting visitors, too.  He was desperately trying to figure it out.  Day and night.  Who was she?
It started about three months ago. Right after the government sold the expedition.  We were ready to go home.
I won't be making the trip.
Let's go home.
Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive.  We had to unlearn everything.
How old were you?
You don't know?
When?  When I'm asleep?
I'm just trying to understand what's going on.
You said he was dead.
Please don't lie.  I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.
Rheya --
Then you'll die.
Thank you.
I can't stay here.
Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?
Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters --
Shhhh.  Just stay with me.  Stay with me.  Everything is forgiven. Everything.
Why do you say that?
Gibarian was helpless.  It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris, and the ship that brought us here.
I'm not Snow.
Looks a little constipated to me.
Then c'mon.  Follow me.  The art's in the basement, you're going to get a privileged peek.
Right.  That's true.
He thinks you're being a little careless.  He made the point several times.
I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
But "nice".
You asked.
Sleep good.
She's okay.  Everything's okay...
What do you want to do?
I don't know.
You don't have to, now.
It was something my father always liked me to do.
Not if you don't want me to.
Your what...?
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
She's got to identify him.
Where'd you get the tie?
It's not your taste.
Why?
Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
Goddamn Venza assaulted a taxi driver in the Bronx, thirteen months ago.  It's coming to court and the judge let him walk because of the pending case law.
I just sat and listened.
I heard.
It should've been me...
Right behind you, T.J.
You in this with me?
Let my kid go.
My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
No, no.
Oh, come on, Ben ,that's not--
See?
I know.  I've got one too.
Why home? The real world beckons, man!  The possibilities are endless.  Want to go up to the World Trade Center and laugh at New Jersey?
Don't be pitiful.
Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
Well, thanks.  You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera, this ambulan--
Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
You print pictures of Bigfoot!
Can I get a word in edgewise?
Hmf-hrr?
Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
Thank God.
Maybe.  I could have stopped it, though.
I've gotta study.
That wasn't clever.  That was just nasty.
Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go.
I know him.
I'm a photographer, remember?
I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
Yeah, a psychiatric hospital. Listen, I'm serious--
Actually, I got this spider bite
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk then.  Bye.
Okay, kid. Call me tomorrow.
A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In  his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely.
Forgive me if I don't feel too sympathetic right now.
I'm not so happy myself.
Jawohl!
Then we shall all zalute Feldwebel von und zu Schulz! About face!
Any news on Dunbar?
He's still in the Kommandant's office. That's all I know.
What's the match gag?
Forty-five cigarettes. The price has gone up.
Look, this may be my last hot breakfast on account of they're going to take away that stove. So will you let me eat it in peace?
Ask Security.  You tell him, Price. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven't you found out yet?
And maybe a little something else?
A little something what?
Don't wear it out!
You are talking crazy!
What is your number?
105-353.
Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?
Jawohl?
Animal! Animal! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? A couple of guys are trying to escape and you're thinking of broads. Broads?
Stop it, Harry!
You can say that again!
They'll shoot you, Animal!
Betty Grable!
You're teasing me again!
You clocked him! Why don't I clock you?
Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
Animal! Animal! Wake up!
Answer the question. How do you rate all those privileges?
And don't blame me if you all wind up in the cooler.
Good.
I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
It adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy. Because I'm telling you. The Krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barrack. And whatever you do to me you're going to have to do all over again when you find the right guy.
Shoot!
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
Oh.
I'll tell you how come.  The Barrack Chief gave them the green light. And you, our Security Officer, said it'd be safe. That's how come.
What about the radio?
Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.
And how about three hundred cigarettes for yourself?
No! No!
Give it back. You must not arouse yourselves.
Where is he?
Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling.
I believe so.
No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.
I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
Your "sixth sense"- I've always wondered where it came from.  And what about Soran?
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
Can I?
What makes you think things will be any different this time?
You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-
You could say that.
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
Yes.  Thank you.
An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
I was ordered to by the Captain.
We learn something new about ourselves every day.  Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.
Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
You can't fool an empath, Captain. I know exactly when I'm needed.
Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input.  "Admiral Lusby, regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly irritable, remote and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to-"
There's nothing selfish about pursuing your own life, your own career.
You see the top yardarm, now look to the-
The star's going to collapse in a matter of minutes.
Plasma coils...is there any way we can use that to our advantage?
Right. And they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds.  Data,lock onto that plasma coil.
And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam!
If he tries to get away with Warp Drive, he's really in for a shock...
Sure - whatever games you wanna play.
Message acknowledged. All units will be informed.
No reply, Chekov... Continue on course...
Wait a minute...! We don't know what we're talking about here...
David... Sorry I'm late.
Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
You mean, we're stranded down here?!
If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
I'll go...
You said there wouldn't be any.
Very well. Exercise caution, Lieutenant. This landing is Captain's discretion and I'm the one who's out on a limb.
Your reputation is secure, Scotty.  Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'll be in my quarters.
Gentlemen... may the wind be at our backs. Stations please!
Scan for vessels in pursuit!
My father says you have been my friend... You came back for me.
She's to be decommissioned.
Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott?
Hmm.. Very odd.  Scotty. Progress report?
My friends, the great experiment: Excelsior, ready for trial runs...
Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
But, why?
Yes...
I see... and I understand.  Then everything that he was... Everything that he knew... is lost. And when I return home empty-handed, many shall mourn.
Yes... But -- how...?
Wait!... Wait...
Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.
Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor.
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
What DO you want? Damn it, why isn't there a girl here? You know this has nothing to do with age. This is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping Galaxies.
And who am I hiding from?
As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds.
How can you think of food at a time like this?
... Can't read you... repeat...
... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
Carol!
I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
Starfleet has kept the peace for a hundred years, I cannot and will not subscribe to your interpretation of this event.
Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI --
What's the matter -- ?
To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.
You realize, sir, that they will attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and confirm the order.
She's making it up! My father was Professor --
We appear to have plenty of time.
You can't!
It was just words.
But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
Oh, I believe it.
They're still running with shields down.
Warp drive still inoperative. All other systems should be restored shortly.
I shall avenge you --
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
I take your point. Stand by to receive our transmission.
I've never even met Admiral Kirk --
Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
Best speed to Regula I. Kirk out. Scotty, I've got to ask: Any chance of getting the mains back on the line?
Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days.
I read you, Captain. Let's have it.
The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
How far?
Too late --
The prefix code is 16309. All commands from each Starship bridge are relayed electronically; each ship has its own prefix combination code...
Be careful, Jim...
Steady as you go...
Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!
I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
Who?
Aye, sir --
Trying, sir!
Inform the Klingons we are on a rescue mission...
I'll try, Captain.
No power to the weapons system, sir.
Never, sir.
You are half human. The Computer knows that.
Fine. Just fine.
A moment alone, please.
... My shoes...
A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
... My God...
It gives me a great sense of danger. We have to beam in next to the reactor room, not in it.
Like what?
Go ahead. Stun me.
Most prudent.  Engine room. Report, Scotty.
Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?
Go ahead.
What's going to happen when you release the whales?
Then --
Or believe, I'll bet.
How did you know Gracie's pregnant? Nobody knows that.
How will that be done, exactly?
I'm all ears.
Noon tomorrow...?!
So. There we are.
I bet you're a damn good poker player.
Think about it -- but don't take too long because I'm out of time. If you change your mind, this is where I'll be.
Calm yourself, Nurse.  Scotty, get us out of here!
He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.
... You have a point...
Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?
Surely you can be more specific...
Availability of fuel components; Mass of the vessel through a time continuum, and the probable location of Humpbacks, in this case, the Pacific basin.
I see.
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
Aye, sir... Three-one-zero to the Bering Sea. E.T.A.: 12 minutes.
Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can --
Yes, sir.
Put them on screen!
Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
Mr. Sulu?
Vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the Federation!
Do you have the right to murder?
Millions?
Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?
The keyboard... How quaint.
It is kind of you to make this effort.
Most kind, Father.
You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
I thought it might begin the healing process.
The "mighty" Federation could learn a few things from this village...
I am better.
Do machines ever play?
If you want to know 'what it's like to be a child', you need to learn how to play...
They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
And I do not believe I made a very good first impression.
In six hours, every living thing in this system will be dead or dying.
... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...
Sir, Commander Worf and I have been working on several tactical plans to safely...
You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.
There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
The Ba'ku.
Recommendations?
We'd have to tag every one of them... that would take time... and we don't have it. The Enterprise is only nineteen hours from communications range with the Federation...
They... are in opposite directions, sir...
By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
Why would they fire at him without provocation?
And yet he attacked us. And told the Ba'ku we were a threat...
Eject the core.
Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...
Actually, I was a good deal older when we arrived... in terms of my physical condition.
Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
I understand. Tell Doctor Crusher to have a hypospray of lectrazine ready...
Make it so.
Beam him out!
Debrief them again.  Have you been in a fight, Commander?
They have an incredible clarity of perception, Captain. I've never encountered a species with such mental discipline...
"Environmental concerns", again. An android could be safely exposed to the elements during the installation of a duck blind...
What are they interested in...?
Your scanners must be malfunctioning.
But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
There must be some good people... even in this time.
More lies.
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
A universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me?
Contact Starfleet Command.
I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
There should be an access hatch nearby...
Phoenix to control.  Initiating five minute countdown... mark.
Tell her to go back to Resurrection.
What's still there?
Entering the upper ionospere...
There's a red light on the second intake valve.
Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.
All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
Can't tell. Long-range bio- sensors are off-line.
Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.
Where the hell are they going?
Target...
I'm going too. They may need a doctor.
Fascinating...
That's the question -
Speak for yourself. One day... one night...
That was the general idea I intended to convey.
Well, if you've got any bright ideas, now's the time to -
Starfleet's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of "exploration"...
If they did we'd all have to turn ourselves in. How CAN we rely on them?
Then let me help!
What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
That's a comfort...
You feign ignorance?
There... were no other ships in the sector.
That we fired two photon torpedoes. But -
Those words WERE spoken by me.
You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock?
First rule of assassination: always kill the assassins.
Mr. Valtane, any more data?
Are you kidding?  Send to Starfleet Command...
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
Kill him! He's the one!!
It IS possible.
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked.
I was asked by my father to open neg-
They're dying.
Spock, I'm really tired...
I am not certain such speculations are included among your duties, Lieutenant.
Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?
In nineteenth century France, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by machines, flung their wooden shoes - called SABOTS - into the gears to stop them. Hence the word SABOTAGE.
What?
Nevertheless.
Not from us!
It means that if we cannot have fired those torpedoes then someone else did.
At present, he's surrounded by a magnetic shield. If my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his escape planning by this time.
Maybe we should write them a letter?
Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
You're working late.
I wish I could believe that, Doctor.
But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.
They're running me ragged. Nothing but question day and night... I love it! Come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it. There's a Bajoran band at the officer's mess.
And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?
Well. I suppose it does a bit. I'm very happy for them, of course, but I'm going to miss them. The ship will seem... incomplete without them.
While I find that fascinating, Data, we really need that Goddamned door open!
Ready, Captain.
Yes.
No, sir, it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me.
It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
Full axis rotation to port! Fire all ventral phasers!
Do you have a name, sir?
And you needn't worry. I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know.
The hell you will. You know too much about me as it is ... Now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed.
Of course, sit down.
As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
Understood.
Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
Theories?
Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.
Aye, sir.
Ready, sir!
The targeting sequence should take about four minutes.

What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
Can anything be done for him?
We can only hope so.
When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance. If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation, I suggest you do so now.
And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions.
Age before rank, Jean Luc.
What's this all about?
I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.
I won't defend my life to you.
He is what his life has made him!
I don't know.
Please.
I have no choices! I can't fight what I am!
Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan!
But, Praetor, you won't survive without him...
My time. I'll spend it how I choose.
FULL STOP AND FIRE !
It's imperative we retain their allegiance or our great mission will be strangled before it can truly draw breath.
But surely...
Benny, this is me. I'm going to take a look.
Thank you.
Sure.
Credit card.
I understand.
Neither did I.
Yes. It's kidnapped a woman at gunpoint and from what we can make out is forcing her to drive it somewhere.
It's taken on a disguise.
We don't know what else to do. We need results.
You just do your job, Shermin. We'll make the policy.
Washington thinks it's too late for that.
If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
Do you know what you were kidnapped by?
What.
Ah no.
Coupons.
Jennyhaydn.
Up there... I... eh... can't explain...  But that's the only place you could be from.
Yes.
I need you.
Eh... yes...
It's a kiss...  Goodbye...
He was a good friend... The captain took the ship away fast and I was not in the ship.
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
You liked my singing?
You can have one.
We'll get a ride in the morning.
I understand.
What for?
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
Can you see under the faceplate?
People have made mistakes in these situations before.
It was a man though... right?
The police think he was high on drugs...
I don't understand.
Judy, that's stupid.
I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.
Hey, fuck you, man.
I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
I'm already hurting.
He has his uses too.
We should talk alone.
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
You think Tran killed her?
The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
What a nightmare.
You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me--
It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
Yup.  So darn lucky.  I wake up with a .22-short floating in my brainpan, and a cop pension I can't live off of.  Good thing I wasn't any luckier.  Bobby!  Another shooter right here!
Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
Top ten.
He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging.  And he records it all.
Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.
He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.
You may be a little overdressed for this party.  Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!
What stuff?
No.  Bad idea.
This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
I intend to.
I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
I won't say anything.
Now that is cold, Lenny.  I always bring you choice.
Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.
What clip?  What was it?
I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
She never gave me a tape.
Your existence.
They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it?  I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately.  Have you noticed?
Define love.
Coming with you.
Let's talk in the car.
Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.
It is my sword and my shield, Macey.
Because Iris knew somebody was after her.
Anywhere.  We'll talk about it in the car.
You better keep a low profile for a while.
Well, look at the plus side.
It was a tough call.
I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
Yeah, right, blow it open.
No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
And do what?  Take on his whole posse?
I still got one ace to play.  Tran's got what I want... and I've got what he wants...
Yeah, right.  Fucked.
Naw.  They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.
Yeah.  We did.
See you downtown.
Right.  That explains it.
Sucks.  Hey, Bobby, turn that up.
Take the tape to the cops.
The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low.
I'm babysitting the DEA guys this afternoon, Casio and I. You said that was top priority.
No, sir.
What does the Manager say?
She's buried.
Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
Yeah.
Look...
What kind?
Please.
Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
Go ahead.
You suspected all along, suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso.
We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.
How do you send out an APB on a dead man?
I understand.
We'll wait. Get online with Low, inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him.
They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
Five months. I love it.
This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
A very sexy case.
It explains a lot.
And one other thing.
He thinks he looks young.
Don't be too harsh.
Just routine stuff.
Not about coming to see Daitz?
Oh.
That's my point. Remember, you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around.
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
What's up?
But he believes in it. That's all that matters. He toyed with you, you toy with him. Convince him you've got a lead on Suspect Zero. Use Zero, you'll find Low.
I got an autopsy report from El Paso that doesn't seem right. A girl on Low's list. Karen Sumpter. We're getting a court order to exhume to body. I'd like you to come and look at it.  Don't worry, I've cleared it.
I...
Sit back.
He always had a weakness in that area. I saw it the first time I met him. We all had our weaknesses, I guess. Daitz wanted the money. With Dave it was the glory. Koessler saw the Behavioral Sciences Unit as a stepping stone to bigger and better bureaucratic things. He had his eye on the Director's job, even then. Catching killers was a means to an end for them.
You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.
It was the mall.
Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.
I see that. Washington to Philadelphia to here. Philly's a nice station. How many agents?
Speck is dead.
Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?
Brilliant? You think he caught any of them because he was brilliant? Hardboy? MyDick? Imelda? Ripper? Think about it, how did he locate them?  He found them as Murman. And how did Murder Man find them? With sweet talk and brains? No. He did it with souvenirs. He took them into private rooms, swapped goodies: pictures, panties, jewelry, body parts. Snuff downloads. As bait. That's why I never exchanged with him. He killed girls, oh yeah, harvested them. He had the best stuff. Richard Low is Murman and Murman is one of us.
You have to put things in perspective.
You've been through worse.
It didn't feel that way.
That's because it was a challenge. You has control over you're situation. It was hard, but you rose to it.
I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks.
Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
I thought real men don't like quiche.
Why? You're not a real man?
Like what?
I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...
Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
You have to lay it on the table.
It's not going to well?
Why, you like the duck with the cigar? 
How are you doing?
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
Right.
So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.
Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
Why?
What? Like, you didn't want to jinx it?
Oh no?
...That's probably a more appropriate analogy.
...yeah, a month ago.
Oh, like that song...
No. Just O.J.
Wow.  You wanna grab a bite?
Rejected?
We ran into them that night at Roscoe's. Tee cleared it up, I apologized, bought them some chicken and waffles. They fuckin love Tee. That boy can talk.
Hi, Nikki. Mike. I don't think this is working out. I think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. It's not you, really. It's me. It's only been six months...
Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
Wow, I guess you were home... 
I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment.
We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? It makes me want to puke.
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
What are you talking about? Vegas?
Tonight, baby.
Look at it, baby. Vegas, baby!
What are you talking about? Look at all the honeys.
Did she, or did she not smile?
Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table.
You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
Baby, this is what we came for. We met a beautiful baby and she likes you.
I don't know...
You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there.
"Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
...It's just, I thought "Renaissance" was too Excaliber, it's the wrong casino. She would've gotten it, though...
Wait... Wait... Just "Brother". So I go in. "Hello... Hi... We loved your guest spot on Baywatch... blah blah blah..." Whatever. So, I start to read, and, Mikey, I was money. I prepared for a week. It's a starring role. I'm crying... The casting director, she starts crying...
I gotta use the phone.
You didn't have to get into it, baby.
I didn't even like her, to be honest.
No, baby. You're money.
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
How?
...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing?
See? And what does this guy she's with do?
Yeah.
Don't give me that! She liked you, man.
I know she liked me. I mean, it's not like I wanted to do anything with her tonight.
Chelios to Roenick...!
...How novel.
No.
That's what I keep trying to tell him.  You're so money, you don't even know...
...and big fuckin' teeth...
...and you got big claws and fangs...
...you're like a big bear.
Now when you talk to her, I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that everyone's pulling for. I want you to be the guy in the rated R movie who you're not sure if you like.
I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
Yes. 
And what is that Bonasera?
An eye for an eye!
America has been good to me...
Godfather.
OK, OK.  You gonna make me something to eat at least?
Understood.
So.  I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection.  No worries about operations, is that what you tell me?
And with prison record.
No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You see?  He is a good godson.
They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?
He was the one behind Sollozzo?
Tattaglia is a pimp.  He could never have outfought Santino.  But I wasn't sure until this day.  No, it was Barzini all along.
What miracles you do for strangers.
I'm going to finish school.
How did you find out?
There are men in this world who demand to be killed.  They argue in gambling games; they jump out of their cars in a rage if someone so much as scratches their fender. These people wander through the streets calling out "Kill me, kill me."  Luca Brasi was like that. And since he wasn't scared of death, and in fact, looked for it...I made him my weapon.  Because I was the only person in the world that he truly hoped would not kill him.  I think you have done the same with this man.
He will get in touch with you through someone you absolutely trust.  That person will arrange a meeting, guarantee your safety...
How do you know I come from America?
Yes.
Come here a minute, Fredo.
Give them some money and send them home.
OK, we sit tight until the old man can give us the lead.  But Tom, I want you to stay inside the Mall. You too, Mike, no chances.  Tessio, you hold your people in reserve, but have them nosing around the city.  The hospital is yours; I want it tight, fool-proof, 24 hours a day.
Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.
No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.
Well it's war!  We might not be in this shape if we had a real war- time Consiglere, a Sicilian.  Pop had Genco, who do I have?  Hey Tom, hey...hey.  It's Sunday, we're gonna have dinner.  Don't be sore.
I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
I'm German-Irish.
Michael...
I told you you wouldn't like him.
Just you.
How is your father?
Tell me you love me.
Please say it.
When will I see you again?
All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time.
Oh your father just had too many visitors.  It interfered with the hospital service.  The police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago.  But don't worry.  I look in on him.
I can help you out...
Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.
What?
All right, Sonny.  All right.
Is it like they say?  Is he that good?
To the city.
I don't need them, Sonny.  I'm just going to see Pop in the hospital. Also, I got other things.
Is it all right if I go to the bathroom?
I do renounce him.
Just be patient.
You think I scam?
You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.
You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price.
Sure. Any time.
Yes, it's vile. Don't worry, you don't have to come.  It's great. You're going to love it.
Marge, you like everybody.
I don't like you.
Bastard!  Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in Naples. I bargained for about two weeks.
Yes please!
Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
I'd pay you. If you would go to Italy and persuade my son to come home. I'd pay you $1000.
See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
Well we certainly know that's true.
No, no brothers, no sisters.
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
I'm prepared to take the blame.
What are you talking about?
What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?
Esatto. I'm always planning.
I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.
Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
How?
Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.
You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.
Sure -- I know, that's too dangerous for you, fair enough, hey! we're brothers, fine, then you do this sordid thing with Marge, fucking her on the boat while we all have to listen, which was excruciating, frankly, plus you follow your cock around like a -- and now you're getting married! I'm bewildered, forgive me... you're lying to Marge then getting married to her, you're knocking up Silvana, you've got to play sax, you've got to play drums, which is it, Dickie, what do you really play?
Ciao bello.  Don't you want to fuck every woman you see. Just once.
Hey, if I'm late, think what her husband's saying!
What are you doing?
Because he's been hiding from me -- what happened at Christmas?
Did this place come furnished? It doesn't look like Dickie. Horrible isn't it? -- so bourgeois.
Have you done something to your hair?
I see you were at Princeton. Then you'll most likely know our son, Dick. Dickie Greenleaf...
I'll try my best, sir. Obviously I'll do anything to help Dickie.
Well, if we all pushed him away what about him pushing us away? You've been a great friend to my son. Everything is someone else's fault. We all want to sow wild oars. Somebody's got to -- what's the word?  The moment someone confronts him he lashes out. He lashes out. You know, people always say you can't choose your parents, but you can't choose your children.
No, he should talk to you alone.
Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.
I hope she never knows.
Frances?
No, well go if you want to, but don't talk to the Police about my face -- they find out he hit me -- he's got a temper -- he could've hit Freddie.  Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you later.
And you, sir? Any better?
What?
I can explain.
Why? When?
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
Marge, I don't know you, so I have no right, but Dickie loves you. He's -- I think you'll find he's coming home to you.
No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when Tom arrived in Mongi.  And now look at you.
Emily.  Just kidding.
What?
I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?
Exactly. 10.30 -- 
Hmm. C'e questa... 
They found this in Dickie's place in Rome.
I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
We'll be there.
Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do.
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
What do you want to change about this moment?
Nothing.
What do you mean lied about who you are?
Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.
Postmortem?
What about Ripley?
Was it? Did you speak to Tom?
May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiance?
Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?
I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a -- confronto -- line-up.  Tomorrow then?
My name is Travis.
That's really something.
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
What's wrong?
No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
Huh?
I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.
Is he Italian?
Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
That's fine.
That's a dollar forty-seven.
The cops and company raise hell they find out.
What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
You carry a piece? You need one?
A girl needs protection.
That's what you think.
I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.
Don't you understand anything?
I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
I was stoned. That's why they stopped me. When I'm not stoned, I got no place else to go. They just protect me from myself.
Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.
He's worse than an animal. Jail's too good for scum like that.
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
Yeah.
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once.
You're not much with girls, are you?
You don't have to.
What do you mean?
There isn't time for that. In other words, you don't know.
Well, he should clean up this city here. It's full of filth and scum. Scum and filth. It's like an open sewer. I can hardly take it. Some days I go out and smell it then I get headaches that just stay and never go away. We need a President that would clean up this whole mess. Flush it out.
Military record?
Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.
Anything you say, officer.
I'm hip.
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
Tell me what you really do.
Hi.
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
I am, too.
Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll take good care of this.
Dad... 
I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst.
I do?
Why me?
After they commissioned it, no one could ever agree on where to put it.  The Methodists wanted it in front of the Methodist Church, the Presbyterians wanted it in front of the Presbyterian Church, the city council wanted it in the lobby of City Hall.  Everyone finally got tired of the fighting.  So they stuck it down here.
Yeah...
Do you have the...
Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
Well... everything.  It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now.
Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.
Yes.
Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
No, sir.
Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party.
I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention of making light of this committee. And I have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. I have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. They've sent me letters from jail.
I... I need a drink of water.
Go ahead, son.
Ben, when's Delly due back?
No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil?
By all means.
You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?
Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.
I remember the picture... but I don't remember where I saw it.
Good to meet you.  Again.
Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
This is the staff of the Bijou.
"one fryer and two-dozen eggs?"
I know it's hard to believe, son, but this place, this little place this wasn't a theater then, this was a palace!  Any man, woman, child, you, me, it didn't matter, you bought your ticket and you walked in and you...
... Ernie.
Between a new screen, paint, plumbing for the concession stand, and about a hundred other repairs around the theater... it's going to cost at least nine hundred dollars to get the Bijou into shape to open up.
Yes.
Dad, I...
You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening.
Lucky you got out, that water's got quite a pull, and it empties straight into the ocean.
Can we get him to the hospital?
Huh?
Don't say that.  There is no such thing as a blacklist.  Now, are you gonna play ball?
Yes.  Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair!
Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's.
Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
What, all of a sudden, "Lucille Angstrom" isn't a name?
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
Some of it might come back to you.
Thanks.
'Course they all know me.  And I know all them.  Town's got my name, don't it?
I despise it.
Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
Where are you from originally, Annie?
How'd you happen to come here?
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
Ohhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably lost his way in the dark.
Cathy!
In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
Mom, please, I know all the democracy jazz. They're still hoods.  He's got a client now who shot his wife in the head six times. Six times, can you imagine it?  I mean, even twice would be overdoing it, don't you think?
I guess it does get a little hectic at times.
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
What's the matter with them?
Why are they trying to kill people?
I wonder if you could help me.
Yep.
Right across the bay there.
Yes?
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
Because there are 8,650 species of birds in the world today, Mr. Carter. It's estimated that five billion, seven hundred and fifty million birds live in the United States alone. The five continents of the world...
I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody.
Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight.
Never mind the law. Cathy, you can start serving the soup.
Yes, very.
And certainly pretty.
You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.
Mother?
That's right. We had a party here this afternoon for Cathy. Her birthday.
I don't know yet.  I think we'll be safe here.  Let's bring that wood in.
He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
Did you close the door?
We know what it is, Al.
These birds were...
Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
Monday?
Yes. I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?
I'm awfully sorry.
I said I wonder if you could help me.
Well... yes, sir, there are.
I understand completely, sir.
I think so, sir.  Now then, let me see.
But how... how do you know my name?
What are you? A policeman?
What made it...
Do you practice here?
You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
To see a friend of mine.  Will you please be careful?
How do you know Annie?
I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and...
None of your business.  Am I still bleeding?
I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head!
Look, Mr. Brenner...
Then it's settled. What time is dinner, Mother?
Dinner's just about ready.  We were out back looking at the chickens. Something seems to be wrong with them.
San Francisco's a long way from here.
I told you what happened in Rome!
Growing a beard...
Take wing!
After the gulls attacked.
At Annie's house. She's all right.
The bay doesn't.
Almost two a.m.
Mitch...
We'll take it slow until we get to the main road.  Are you ready?
I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address. 
For what purpose?
To...  To kill them.
I think we're in trouble. I don't know how or why this started, but I know it's here and I know we'd be crazy to ignore it.
Help how? What do you want to do?
They are incapable of organized warfare!
But can't you give me any idea?
Did he tell you about Georgina?
Of course I will.
It's not the failure. I feel that MacFarlane has taught me nothing. He taught me the mathematics of anatomy but he couldn't teach me the poetry of medicine.
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
But I -- well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh and told her.
Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.
Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any "subjects"?
Believe it or not.  It's best for you to pretend that you do.  After all, it was you who ordered this specimen, received it here, and paid for it.  That makes you a party to murder.
Pulse?
They'll be thinking of that, too.
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
Why not? I must have subjects. It's the only way I can teach. It's the only way you can learn. The stupidity of the people the idiocy of their laws will not stop no -- nor will they force me to deal with such reptilian creatures as Gray. We can do our own dirty work -- and we must.
Well --
I can't.
I wanted to see the white horse --
I'm by way of being a medical myself.
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
Why don't you do it then?
Maybe there's some private reason between you and me which will make you -- some long lost friend of ours.  Say that you'll do it for me and my friend, Mr. Fettes, here.
I've had some experience.
What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
And you're a fool, Toddy -- and no doctor. It's only the dead ones that you know.
Would you grudge me a glass with my old crony, Meg?
You are not to set foot in here again, Gray, for business or any other reason. And you're going out now!
So, Toddy, you've made me a disease, eh?
There's nothing I can say for one small child?
I'm not dying for your goddamn illusions. You got that? You think you and your girlfriend had some rosy future ahead of you? Bullshit. She was already bored, why do you think she was looking around? You're nothing, Corvis! Less than nothing.
I'm thinking... that explains a lot.
We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "The Hole."
A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
Capital case nine nine dash C one one five. Alex Corvis.  Exhibit A.
A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.
What Scar? What fucking scar?
And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.
Because you need to understand. And you need... to be careful.
No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise...
He's looking for something. Won't stop until he finds it.  Sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want.
Erin knows, doesn't she?
Let's hope not. License and registration please.
What did I say?
Just hold on to me.
About you.
I don't believe you.
If you mean that you are afraid of us--
We want to be sure you don't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children... You see, we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years.  We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago.  So long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves -- with your primitive tanks and planes -- we were unconcerned. But soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships -- and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets. That, of course, we cannot tolerate.
You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.
I assure you such power exists.
Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that would affect the entire planet.
Maybe a little demonstration.
Something dramatic -- but not destructive.  It's quite an interesting problem.  Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?
Aw, gee, Mom -- I had plans to play with Mr. Carpenter.
Yes, I have!
You didn't really see the space ship. You just thought you did.
I was speaking of earth men. I meant the greatest philosopher -- the greatest thinker.
He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
Certainly.  Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
No -- I want to take you to the movies.  Do you think they'd accept these?
I'll say goodnight again.
And the lungs are the same as ours. Must mean a similar atmosphere -- similar pressure.  How old do you think he is?
I don't believe it.
About five months -- your months.
You must have come a long way.
From another planet. Let's just say that we're neighbors.
I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
We're very curious about that, too. Would you care to talk about it?
I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances.
You must have a rather strange impression of us.
I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth.
Believe me, you don't understand. They wouldn't sit down at the same table.
I've been dealing in Earth's politics a good deal longer than you have.  Goodnight, sir.
I will not speak to any one nation or group of nations.  I don't intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies and suspicions.
Well, we could--
You ready?
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
You think it's all right for you to stay here?
I've got a good lock on my door.  And Bobby's going to sleep in my room tonight.
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
Is that what you're thinking about?
I feel different right now.
Goodnight, my dear.
May I walk out with you?
I -- I didn't really pay much attention--  Bobby has such an active imagination.
We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse.
Yes -- Just exactly.
Where is the meeting going to be?
There's no limit to what he could do. He could destroy the Earth.  If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort. You must give him this message: "Klaatu barada nikto." Please repeat that.
Remember those words.
I think I'm very lucky. You don't always get a chance to recognize a mistake before you make it.
We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening.  I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.
That's right.
You don't.
Yeah.
We don't ride with vampires.
El Vampiro.
Those two we brought back with us. The girl and the kid.  I don't trust 'em.  I say we terminate 'em while we can.
The meanest!
C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
You're eating maggots.  How do they taste?
Why?  They're only noodles.
With him?
Well... he only shows up at the store after dark.  And today, his dog attacked my mom.  Listen to this.  From <u>Vampires</u> <u>Everywhere</u>...  'Vampires require a daytime protector -- a <u>Guardian</u> -- to watch over them as they sleep. For it is during the day that the vampire is most vulnerable. Since they hold sway over animals, <u>fierce dogs -- the hounds of Hell</u> <u>-- are often employed for this</u> <u>purpose</u>.'
That's exactly what this place is. One great big coffin.  Let's stake 'em.
Closet monster!?
Max?  You men we're having company again?
'Again'?  Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.
No, I just like to read the <u>T.V.</u> <u>Guide</u>.  Read the <u>T.V. Guide</u>, you don't need a T.V...
Whatcha doin' over here?
Been fixin' to build me fence one of these days.  Bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years.  Well, one more day won't hurt. Wanna go into town with me?
This is Michael.
Oh, no, you won't.
Grandpa has plans of his own.  Michael, I want you to do this. Everybody has been bending over backwards for you.  You come home late.  You sleep in to the middle of the day -- Sam is always alone. You do exactly what you want... tonight do what I want for a change.
Can we go now, huh? LUCY Maybe later.  Grandpa's expecting us.
In here?
Okay.  Have you been eating pizza?  You smell like garlic.
Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.
Vampires, Mom!  Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers!  The TV stations! They'll listen to you.  They'll believe you...  you're a <u>mom</u>!
No, I'm not...
Mom!
So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy?  We've got it all.  Best selection in Santa Carla.
I'm not looking for a tape.  What I need is --
It's <u>garlic</u>!!  I like garlic, but...
Our batting average isn't very good is it?  So far we're zero for two.
I don't understand Sam.  He's just not like this.
I hope so.
Well... what do I know?  I'm a bachelor.  Lucy... this is going to be a very special night, I promise you.
If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
I'm Michael.
Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  David's blood.  I'm one of them, Star!  I'm just like them!
You're not going anywhere...  Sam...
Take laddie.
Come on, Sam, you know before there were malls there was 'like the ocean.'
Entertain yourself.
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
Don't kill anybody until we get back to you...
I know.
Anybody sick?
I've got six dead Norwegians on my hands, a burned up flying saucer, and we've just destroyed the scientific find of the century.  Now fuck off!
No, you're not!  I don't trust any of you!
I don't know who to trust.
Know what you mean, Blair.  Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
What?
Have you come across Fuchs?
Don't get near 'em.  The plants! They're alive.  Those things can imitate anything...
That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.  Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
I'm working it!  Nothing's happening!
Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
Well, go on.
I don't know how.  Because he's different than we are.  Because he's a space guy.  What do you want from me, anyway.  Go ask Blair.
That's good enough.
Then kill me.
What do you mean "you think so?"
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
Maybe we shouldn't.
All in Norwegian.
Damn you, MacReady!
Yes, there is.  I'd like to go up.
Started with six.  There'd be four others left.
Then get a move on.  Childs, come with me.
Then we go after him.
What for?
MacReady...?
Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
Exactly like you.  Well, maybe not as healthy.
You have books?!  Kalen, you've got to take me there.  There might be history.  Records.  Something to help us find where the Morlocks took --
What kind of stories?
This is it?
You know of them?
What?
It frightens you.
Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?
Yes.
What do you mean?
We make them see what we wish.
How?
As our bodies atrophied our minds... compensated.
I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now.
But this is barbaric!  Have you completely lost all sense of --
Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw.  Why would you come back to this?  To save a few cattle?  No.
No...
No...
It's always the tiger for you, Alexander, haven't you learned that by now?...
I'm a foolish man.
I don't think that's going to happen.
I've only read about them -- and the new internals.
Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
Not like this.  Never like this. Emma, I swear to you -- if I've learned one thing, it's that moments like this are rare.  And I will thank God for them every moment of every day.
God, and I'm running late --
Alex, this is your first year as an associate professor.  You might want to play things a little more conservatively.
That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
Oh?
There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
You care for me.  And you're concerned.  And I have to start living my life again.  I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
I'm glad.
Why not?
Every night.
I can see Kalen's point.
What's it all for?
Or mud carriers.
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
Looking back... I suppose it was. I didn't quite realize it at the time but...
Someone you loved very much.
Do you have it?!
Yes, sir, he --
Do they?
The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation, a careful evolutionary process, not chalkboard parlor-tricks.
He said he traveled for two months.
Why?
New Yorkers.
We have to go after them, find where -- !
Then it's time to change that --
Now you are upsetting my fowl. Please go.
And you've no idea where he went?
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
It's not my job to believe you.
Means we believe in doing his work and fear what the world would be like if we didn't at least try to.
I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know.
I thought you said you never knew your father.
I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
I never touched your father! I swear!
[Beat] Thank you.
I can't take you out of here in your condition...
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
[Beat] What?
Yeah.
How? Did they figure it out after I died?
Then, where are you going?
I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive.
You're not crazy.
No. I don't want it to.
Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.
I was working with a boy named Eugene.
Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place.
Well, what time is it?
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
I did?
Yeah, you were. What you said about them taking me out to the woods...
[Beat] How do you know?
You could still always give Becker an itch. 'Course you might get killed when he goes to scratch it, but seems to me you're saying that's about to happen anyway. [Beat] Just be careful not to walk yourself right into something.
[Shrugging] What if we are? There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [Beat] Everyone does it, don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3.
[Beat] I'm not deaf.
Sure.
You like it?
You remember it?
Uh-huh.
You want anything special for dinner?
Funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a Friday night.  You'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend.
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say it was some ol' gal, some ol' gal's husband.  But it wasn't either one of those two.  The tall one, the redhead, she left me a huge tip.
Sure.  Maybe over coffee sometime. I'll buy.
Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
Well, we're not in the middle of nowhere, but we can see it from here.
I do believe you.  That's what I want everybody to believe.  Trouble is, it doesn't look like an accident and you're not here to tell me about it... I need you to help me here.
Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.
Just some young guy.  Around twenty years old.  Dark hair.
He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  Nothin' at all.  He already got all their money.  I just don't know what we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just wait it out a little longer.  She said she was gonna call back.  Let's just sit tight.
We don't have a whole lotta choice, do we?  I can't figure out if they're real smart or just really, really lucky.
What for?
It's okay.  I'm married, too.
Stop it!  Goddamnit, I mean it! Louise is gonna wonder where I am. Let go!
Thelma?  It's me.
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
Well, you wanna use the shower?
No, I mean how would you do it?  Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
A regular outlaw.
What the fuck is going on?
Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.
Peaches.
What?
It's nothin' like that.
Front.
As far as I'm concerned, yes, ma'am, you are.
Then what difference does it make if we stop?  Come on.  I never get to do stuff like this.
Tell me somethin'.  Is this my vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.
Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
In the meantime, you said we were gonna have some fun.  So let's have some!
What?  Oh, I don't know.  Let me look.
I don't know.  I won't be.
Louise and Darryl don't get along.
No we shouldn't, but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime!
Litterbug.
To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.
I... I...
Just past Boise City.
I can see that.
Well, now, maybe you won't have to.
We should have just ignored him.
What?  What's not funny, Thelma!
Please, God, please don't let us get caught.  Please, please, please...
You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you?  I mean, I just wanna know.
Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all?
It would have to be pretty damn good.
And, oh my God, that other thing, that pointing to your lap?  What's that supposed to mean exactly?  Does that mean pull over, I want to show you what a big fat slob I am or...
What?
How do you stay so positive?
Grrrreat!
The thing's kind of heavy.
That's great, Woogie, I'm happy you're better -- you seem... good --but... you put me through quite an ordeal, you know.
I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.
Good-looking?
Nah.
Well why don't you look her up?
Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
Yeah, I guess he still lives with her. Seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence.
Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.
I am?
No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this.
Got cash.
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!
Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!
Out getting coffee.
From high school Mary? Yeah, I saw her about six months ago at a convention in Las Vegas.
No, thanks.  Love a little bundt cake if you have some!
Stalker, huh?
I'm doing okay.  I gotta get ready for work.
What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
Relax, he just ate.
Healy, what I just tell you?
You own a home there?
Thanks.
No, I mean
They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff.
Why bounce when you have your own condo in Nepal to go to?
Huh. I guess I just wish they made them like they used to. You know, something like The Heartbreak Kid... or Harold and Maude.
Well, I'll see ya.
Hey, watch your mouth -- she's a great gal. I'm the dumbshit for lying to her.
Don't play games with me, Ted.
You don't buy what?
No.
You want her dead, don't you?
Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.
So she hasn't changed?
Oh my.
She's in a wheelchair?!
Good good.
Oh. I thought  That's not it anyway. I know this doesn't make any sense to you, but I just can't turn it off that fast. I still feel something for her.
That's right -- if you weren't you would've looked for her yourself!
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
Who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me?!
What do you mean?
I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico -- please!
Nice.
Why you son of a --
I never said that.
A salesman -- that's what I am. I mean, I'm gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own company -- video sales -- just as soon as I get enough seed money.
'That right? Good for you.
I don't want someone who'll put up with him. I want someone who will enjoy him, the way I do. Do you know what he told my friend Tucker? He said he would've popped the question a lot earlier if Warren wasn't in my life.  Well he is in my life and I'm goddamn lucky to have him. The hell with Steve.
Must have a sweet tooth. See if you can find some cookies.
Oh no? I ain't seen you beaming like this since you broke ninety on the Blue Monster.
No, it's an old football injury.
Oh, are you on the team?
The prom -- you going?
Oh yeah.
Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of mine decided to... ah... you know... just... drive down.
Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets.  God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.  There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution.
Trying to be.
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
That you put a murderer on my trail?
I did it because because I'd never stopped thinking about you and if I didn't find you I knew my life would never be good again.
Go!
Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun -- the guy doesn't even drink beer or gamble.
Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!
Oh.  Oh, that's a good one.
Teddy, be brave.
What are you doing?
Carrying out our mission, Mr. Secretary. If you don't mind, we're very busy right now. We need to be able to do our jobs.
Get out of our way, Mr. Secretary. The navy has been running blockades since the days of John Paul Jones.
This was not the President's intention when he gave that order. What if the Soviets don't see the distention? What if they make the same mistake I just did?  There will be no firing anything near ANY Soviet ships without my express permission, is that understood, Admiral?
And it can be relayed beyond Comrade Khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government
Then you'll call, right?
We've got bigger problems right now.
McNamara's on his way back here now. We need to pick the right ship. No subs. No armed boarding parties either. We need a little more time to figure this one out.
We got a bunch of smart guys. We lock 'em up together in there, kick 'em in the ass til they come up with options.
It's too politicized with you in there, anyway. They need to be able to stick their necks out.
Give it a rest. You were thinking the same thing, just didn't have the guts to take the heat.
Something your father would've come up with.
We just got a second letter from Khruschev. The deal's off.
What does the letter say?
And if there has been a coup and there is no acceptable political solution?
All right. Then I guess it's time.
No. I'm glad I'm home.
I want an hour with him.
I, uh...
Then we need to do a few things right away. No Pierre. He knows, the press knows. You're going to have to keep up your schedule -- your movements are followed too closely. And we need to get these guys out of the White House. George Ball's got a conference room at State.  Reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight.
There is no expert on this subject, no wise old man.
Damn right I'm scared.
I don't know. I don't know.
Fair enough. But Castro's on alert and we're flying attack planes over their sites, on the deck. There's no way for them to know they're carrying cameras, not bombs. They're going to be shot at, plain and simple.
Zorin must not have gotten instructions. Somebody in their Foreign Ministry's blown it big-time.
Okay, Ken. We're going.
Why else would they approach us in this way? It's deniable. The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us. This could be more of the same.
Oh, I'm set, Sir. I'm set.
A murder. On the reservation.
The main problem is, Ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non-Indians. Relations have not been amicable.
It ain't Geronimo.
Who are you?
Whoever dusted Leo, dusted him from the driver's seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the Badlands. Jimmy Looks Twice has never been behind the wheel of a car. It's a known fact out here that he's petrified of driving. His parents were killed in a car wreck.
Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...
Ray. I never get into bed with somebody unless I know for sure. Just the way I was raised.
Never turn your radio off! I thought I was gonna find you scalped! Damn it!
We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray. I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over.
You're steppin' on sign.
Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.
He says he saw you in a vision some time ago.
Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament.
Grandpa traded with me.  Goodbye.
Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
And I don't give a goddamn about whether you wear a badge or not, Crow Horse, but I didn't cut you.
We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water.
Listen to the water... the river keeps goin' down then rising again.
What we need... is Richard Yellow Bird.
He's looking at a few hundred years in Leavenworth. He's not gonna come out without a fight.
Bullshit, let's get outta here,
Black Tail District, X22. You ready for this? Leo wasn't killed in the Badlands. I... I found the location.
Go ahead, Ray.
Leavenworth a tough joint?
Washington sent ya. I know that.
Get up!
Leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell Jimmy. But you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered. Do you realize what Leo could have told Jimmy?! Do you?!
Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
Why not?
I saw one.
I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
Where did you see that?
Where were you?
You know. The finger.
Um. You.
Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
Used to what?
You ever think about killing another human being?
. Yeah!
Doesn't it ever bother you?
This is it, then.
The dark side. The price you pay for all the fun you're having. You knew about it, of course. Didn't you?
Do what, show you a good time?
Hardly ever.
I like to play "reality".
It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing.  One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.
How could you?
I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was "I'm embarrassed, I feel I've done something wrong, that I've failed, and I don't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." That about it?
Sir. You are going to give me a warning, Sir!
Maintaining course. Straight for Mustang.
These guys are getting on my nerves.
What?  What is it?
You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
So, you're scared--so what? You ever get a good look at me in the back seat, I'm goddamn terrified.
Swell! Passing ten thousand!
The list is long, but distinguished.
Mister to you.
Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
Don't chew it, you won't have it that long. Easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks.
Come on. I died enough for one night.
They should have warned you about that one.
What'd you do?
Until last night. Did you see the moves I was making on that girl at the party?
I think I can work it out on my own.
So have I.
Didn't everybody?
I lost.
Not something they tell dependents.
Freaks?...'Fraid so, man.  Goes with the territory.
I think my grampa might be here.
I'd advise you to hurry.
Thank you.
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
Listen to me, Richter, I want Quaid delivered alive for re-implantation. Have you got that?  I want him back in place with Lori.
Who told you to think?!  I don't give you enough information to think!  You do what you're told!!  That's what you do!
Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!
Why not?
Slim, athletic, voluptuous?
Forty-one A, Ernie.
Any news of Quaid?
Not since you lost him.
This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down.
You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?
"RekallRekallRekall."  You thinkin' of goin' there?
Harry!
Are you crazy?!  I don't know anything about Mars.
Level 2.  Galleria.
Split up.  Find him.
Mmmm.....
It was implanted by the Agency.
Beats me.  I just work here.
I didn't know you were so kinky.
I'm here at Rekall.
Doug, don't!
Good to see ya. Right this way.
Right.  Mars.
What's in the two week package?
No options.
I'm not interested in that.
Not any more.
Forget I said wife.
No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
Melina, please...People are trying to kill me.
I'm not sure dear?  What do you think?
No problem.  Nice meeting you. Hope you get it sorted out.
Probably couldn't move too easily on the surface.
VAL, STOP!  THEY'RE COMING!  DON'T MOVE!
Could we make it to the mountains?
Has a lot of rain.
I thought you called it your pecker.  Look, don't make the mistake I made.  Twenty years of looking for a woman exactly like Miss October 1968, and where'd it get me?  Here with you.
Yeah, sure.  Go ahead and plan it...for a year or two.
In the past year I must've said a hundred times "We gotta get out of Perfection.  We gotta better ourselves."  You gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think I'm the reason we're still here?  You want to know how close I am to going to Bixby right <u>now</u>?
I'll call that little bluff.  How close?
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
Especially when it's two hundred feet off the ground.
You got <u>that</u> right!
Little sons of bitches.
Fuck you, too.  Pardon my French.
It's been listening to us.  It's got no eyes.  It sure as hell can't smell anything underground, so I figure...
Its tires are flat...
Like hell you are.
Don't worry about me, jerkoff.
Yeah...but no ties.
You are so full of shit...
You bet.
They're tearing down the houses here!  We all gotta get outta here together!  Now!
Ah, but consider this, if we don't finish the roof, we can looks at that sky all the time.
Could be.
Okay, ten dollars.
Yeah, well, I'm getting what I refer to scientifically as "weird vibes."  every sensor I've got is giving me strange readings.  I mean, the school has had these machines up here three years and they've never recorded anything like this.
Yes, see, they move very easily through the Pleistocene Alluvials...  ...the dirt...the loose soil that makes up the valley floor.  But they can't move through solid rock. I think we should travel west to the mountains.
It does.
Why do you all keep asking me?
You guys do all the odd jobs.
Please... I need to sleep...
I would like to put Shu's alleged crime in a context, your Honor. And we do have the foremost expert on prison and street gangs right here in this room... If it please the court, I'd like to call Mr. Reynard.
A "description"? What, Asian male 18 to 30, black hair, brown eyes?
No. No...
-- an angel dust dealer --
-- a speed manufacturer --
-- Listen: "November 5, 1980. Cecil Stipe walked into 5th Precinct. Says he witnessed Chin shooting, saw suspect's picture in Post. Says Shu Kai Kim wrong man."
What, the lunatic who --
Hey, Clyde Gruner sold these guys a pound of crystal meth at cost. We're Clyde's buddies, it's cool.  Next exit.
That's not gonna happen. I'm gonna create reasonable doubt. Buckle your seatbelt and watch me work.
Eddie, I'm not working on this case. You boys have fun.
Kitty, where exactly do you place the microphone to catch the most incriminating moans?
Have you considered that Chuckie Roeder's not calling himself Chuckie Roeder these days? Get his mugshot from one of the many law officers who've got hotpants for you... then canvass those art supplies places. We're gonna win this one, Kitty, but ya gotta believe...
EXACTLY!
Well I know that you're innocent, Shu -- even if you forgot.
"No," what?
When I joined up I took an oath of secrecy. I told you what you needed to know.
Good. Now we're going to take an affadavit from you, but only concerning the facts of the Chinatown shooting. We honestly don't give a shit about the Kennedy assassination.
Did the police make any attempt to phone you, to follow up?
Don Reynard.
This and that.
That's right.
But I'm a quick study. Tell your Deputy D.A. -- Rabin? -- that I'll see him in court.
Calls for speculation.
We just discovered him, your Honor! His appearance is critical to a fair presentation of our case! He is an inmate at Ossining Correctional and --
The witness will substantiate Mr. Kim's modus operandi. It's circumstantial evidence in the case at hand!
Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
I hope so, Mr. Reynard.
Shouldn't one of us...?
I'm Roger Baron. I work with Edward Dowd.
A Cubano army, basically... inside and outside prisons.
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.
If a member of the Aryan Brothers tries to cut in on your distribution?
You mean to say Mr. Kim told you that he murdered Jimmy Chin?
What color hair will she have?
She is preparing a great abundance of food.
I'm glad you let me talk to you. You used to not let me talk to you.
I want you.
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
We've got our own clock. We'll lock up.
Sam, get the body and put it in the van.  Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
Chalfont. Weird. Chalfont was the name of the folks that rented the space before they did. Two Chalfonts.
That's right. That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here.
Oh.
No you couldn't.
I think I'll take off my badge as well.
Anything else?
Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil?
And neither will I.
No one could've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this.
No, sir, we did not.
That would indicate that it's the future.
No.  Ask Irene over there.
Say no more.
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
Yes, it is good.  What do you think is in these other drawers?
Agent Desmond, would you hold the finger for me. There's something up there.
I don't take it, Sam. I give it.
Thanks.
When?
The usual, 9:15.
Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
No, and yes. I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.
Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?
Oh god, Laura.
Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D.
Laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink?
Nothing.
I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night long.  They all knew you at that place.
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
I haven't got it yet.
But Bob isn't real.
Bob is real. He's been "having" me since I was 12.
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
How can I be together if I'm not together?
What?
No.
Sex?
We throw away the whole head.
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that?
Norma, are you alright?
How good's your intelligence?
...tell me about this case.
We thought it was just.
That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone. She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends -- and the people who should care for her: her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way. We have been paid to look the other way. I came in here to take your money.  I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.  I can't take it. If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.  I can't do it. I can't take it.
Mickey told him to call.  'He's some very hotshot surgeon at Mass. Commonwealth. He wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye. You meet him at the hospital.'
It looks that way.
You know these doctors could have settled out of court. They wanted a trial. They wanted to clear their names.
You've just said you signed it.
Because I kept a copy. I have it right here.
No.
What book is that?
...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
Nothing further, your Honor.
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby... Ms. Nevins...
...We did everything we could...
I understand.  I went to the Bar Association. They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
...I made a reservation at...
You know... sometimes people can surprise you. Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
I am on the staff of...
And you wrote that...
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
Right. Who called?
Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.  Her doctors murdered her.
Do you know who her doctors were?
...the case with anyone. And I'll meet you Tuesday, and we'll go over your testimony...
...things change.
That's perfectly all right.
The TV didn't work.
That's what I'm going to try to do.
We, we... No... we just had a small reversal in the case...  I have some, uh... I have some work to do...
What happened...?
Yes.
What is that to you...?
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
It's locked?
...we, we love her, Dick and me...
My doctor told me that I got to move out West... that's when we filed in court. We didn't want to sue...
...But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson... and they called him up and said to come out. He's a good man. He's only trying to do what's right.
I'm going to see you get that chance.
Are we going to win?  We have, you know, other tactics, though...
I'm going to help her.
Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
Mary Rooney. She won't talk to me. I tried her at the hospital. I'm going to try her back at home. Read this.
I'm swell.
Who? They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
She didn't do anything. She took the patient's history and signed the charts. 'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
I don't want a mistrial.
I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
She told me.
Yes, that's correct.
Yes.
So far you're great. You got a cigarette?
Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
Why, sure -- I got it!  Do you have a match?
How can you say that when you don't know him!
Where are we?
I liked him.
Maybe ...  Maybe they want to take us alive.
You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
Don't let's lose each other.
Have you got a pocket compass?
If we get what transportation we can, and pick up instruments and books from Pacific-Tech...
Looks like the fishing was good.
I'd like to borrow your car and take a look at it in the morning.
And they'll go out the minute there's another ray.  A cylinder reported down by Huntington Beach.  That's a job for the Navy.
Thank you, sir.  If they start anything, we can blast them right off the earth!
I don't follow.
Chase...
You get any sleep last night?
Okay, but it still doesn't mean it can't be over with.
Chase. Hi...
Like Freddy.
Diabetes?
It was an earthquake and it was dark.  I have no idea.
Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
You have a fever, sweetie?
Just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
Call it a guess...
When it is denial.  I don't think that's the case here, but if you're really worried, have a doctor check him out. You'll see, everything's fine.
Kids know when something's bugging a parent.  You've got no idea who this is calling?
Steady...
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
Thanks.  Just give them the time he called.  They're keeping a list, supposedly.  Sorry.  My nerves are so raw these days.
Sure.  We'll do an operation, Doctor Dylan and Doctor Julie. We'll fix him good as new.
By storytellers, of all things.  Every so often, they imagine a story good enough to catch its essence.  Then it's held prisoner for a while.  In the story.
Choice?  What kind of choice?
Maybe we should ask him, hmmm?  We've got a surprised, Heather.  A great big surprise for you and our audience.
Black's fine.
Me too.
She said "None the better, you all go to hell..."
Good.  Let's go sailing.
We've got weather moving in from the west.
But your instinct was to lose sail?
I know.
It's not a vacation, it's private school.
I guess.
Well, and it's pretty cool too, ya know?  Bein' here together an all...
But that's not the point...
Yes.
Look, I just better go.
'Cause they're getting a divorce.  That's why they sent me here.  My sister's at Tabor.  They just wanted us out of the house so they could get down to business.
Kennet Square, PA.  'Mushroom capital of the world'.
I couldn't.
Speak up boy!
He killed the dolphin.
It's his father sir.  He's suffocating him.  We've all seen it...
Is that what you were trained to do?
No.
No.
Will you shut up?  You sound like my fucking sister.
Because I felt like it.  What do you care?
What is it... the secret?
It hurts too much to care.
About anything.
You've gotta be kidding?
But, they don't speak English.
The first thing is I don't like people talking when I'm talking so the two of you, shut up.
I'm not staying out here.
I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
They are much more than that, sir.
I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.
Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
Thank you. It's listeners such as yourself who made me want to get up out of that hospital bed and back into the studio as fast as I could.
Why? He's right in the groove.
Seein's how you're about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss, don't know how you can criticize.
You know, I really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... Can you fuck like that?... You like it like a bunny?... Huh?... Cause baby, I'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack-rabbit bunny... Jump all around in that hole... Bobby Peru doesn't come up for air.
Someday honey, I will... But I have to be goin' now... Conta i no joras...
You an indian?
What's that?
Well... I mean like Lula bein' in a family way.
Have now.
Come on outside, I got somethin' to show ya.
You heard from Reggie?
Muchas gracias.
Don't talk down to me, Johnnie Farragut. I know what volition means, and that's why I want Sailor Ripley off the planet! He's pure slime and it's leakin' all over my baby. Maybe you could push him into makin' some kinda move and then kill him dead. You'd only be defendin' yourself, and with his record, nobody'd fuss.
Did she tell you where she was callin' from?
Seven tomorrow evenin'. We can eat at Galatoire's. Fix it.
Peanut...
I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'?
Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after I planted Bob Ray Lemon. A man can't ask for more than that.
I can't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth.
And you never told nobody about it?
Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin' in Myrtle Beach. They still got way too much traffic there for my taste... And another thing, baby... That government of ours should be keepin' us separated from outer space...
You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut. Ain't we been doin' a pretty fair job this far?
You tell the boy who knocked you up?
It was my cousin, Dell, done it? His folks used to visit with us summers.
What happened to him?
Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
Her face was half-pushed into the pillow, and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said, 'I won't suck you. Don't ask me to suck you.'
They sure do stink.
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
Come look at this.
Say what? Honestly, sugar, you can talk more shit sometimes?
You really are dangerously cute, honey. I gotta admit it.
Ever imagine what it'd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast? Sometimes I think it would be the biggest thrill?
I was hopin' you would. I know that night by heart. Sometimes, honey? I think it's the best night of my life.
No, I like gettin' up around four a.m. and talkin' bout wild animals... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn't remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldn't remember any of my dreams.
What was this one?
Who knows, baby?
I know you're thinkin' that I got more'n some of my mama in me? Well, I couldn't help it. Sailor, I really couldn't. I'm sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin' hunk of awful-smellin' meat out of his pocket? I near barfed. And them poor diseased puppies!
Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.
I can't take no more of this radio...  I ain't never heard so much concentrated weirdness in my life, Sailor Ripley, you find me some dancin' music right this minute... I MEAN IT!!
...They was laughin' arm in arm like animals.
I do trust you, Sailor. Like I ain't never trusted nobody before.
No, I don't think so, Sail. I just need to lie down.
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
That smell's still fillin' this room good.
You talk to 'im some?...
He's the kind liked it.
Lead the way.
Boys frightened, Lula. This ain't no good.
What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there.
How can you say that, Sailor?
The Indian official who supplied this information did so only on condition of anonymity. The Uttar Pradesh state authorities last October released five hundred turtles...
Like hell.
If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am.
You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
Right?! Mama, was it right for you to sic Johnnie Farragut on us? How could you do that?
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
What if I asked you not to?
And jus when my baby's out on some Texas road with a killer.
NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
In the head.
Yes.
My very best to Johnnie... Bless his soul.
What?...
Well, she wants to fuck you.
Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
Life is unpredictable.
Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it?
Actually... I just want to go home.
Yeah. Like in Against All Flags. Only they use a couple big hams.
Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion.
You're welcome.
Your wife.
Perfect. Well then, shall we?
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.
Isn't she?
She left me. Crabs.
But. ...why didn't you say something, Tripp? I mean, what are we doing here?
I'm sure. Where is everyone?
He is. Take my word for it.
Shit.
Hey, I heard all about it -- the parents, the grandparents, the China town thing -- and I believe you, okay? That's why we're here. Now go get dressed.
Uh huh. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car...
Jeff. Sorry. I didn't even know this was your house until about an hour ago.
Oh, Professor Tripp? You know, last semester, what I said that time in office hours -- I hope there's no hard feelings.
The last month maybe.
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
And you're saying it's some kind of sign? What the fuck's the matter with you?
Sure.
Sounds like a good one.
So I'm told.
Really?
I had to. Didn't I?
Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.
That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
Most of the time he is, James. Some of the time he isn't. Now what do we have here?
Mmrrmmm... KNAP SAP!
Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the English Department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia.
Who?
Your aunt?
I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt.
Kinship. And what's here?
Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you can start on the box.
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
I eat.
Nowhere. You just sit here and... eat.
I'm not going, with them.
Near Carvel?
In the crawl space, with the rats and the casks of Amontillado. Come on. Up.
Well, let's see if we can keep that from happening.
I thank you.
No, it's not that, it's...
Hm.
You got me.
Did you confess?
Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...
Are you limping? Why are you limping?
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
All right.
What's he doing out there?
It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
Inside.
Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
I know, but sometimes...
James is... I don't know...
Tony. Now that I'm home.
Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one.
That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
It's a bathtub. What she's standing under.
Well, jeez, you're reading his biography, aren't you?
Her husband.
It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you know that. It's a young man's book. It got me remembering how it felt to be young.
I might have his number on campus.
You want to keep him happy.
Law says I can't come within one hundred feet of where children congregate. I figure the distance from my window to the school is one hundred and twenty. Make a bet?
I'm working on it.
How old is Anna?
She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.
She's got all this new furniture now. She said it didn't fit anymore, so I kept it in the attic. I thought you might like it.
You should see my appointment book. It got crazy.
It's not what you think.
Isn't it?
The important thing is that you and Annette need to talk. She needs to see you, and you need to see her.
You don't have to tell me this.
Did you ever... Do you have feelings for Anna?
I don't like starlings.
Why not?
How does it sound?
It's a bright sound.
Got something to hide?
You can't talk to me like --
You going to take me on a nature walk?
I fell asleep.
Do you believe in them?
Woodsman?
The one with the ax?
Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.
That's it. Little Red Riding Hood jumps out of the wolf's guts with hardly a scratch.  Ever see a seven-year-old girl sodomized almost in half?
Know what?
No.
I was asleep.
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
You're a cop. Figure it out.
And your new apartment?
Can I ask how old you are?
I will be in three months.  I can't wait. I hate being eleven. It has to be the stupidest age in the world.
They could be finches. I don't know. We should go before it gets dark.
Someone will talk to your daddy. And then he'll stop doing those things... the things you don't like.
You should go home.
Can't I stay a little longer?
It's all the same.
What?
A diary?
Ev-i-dence.
Bad idea.
You think reflection is good.
I'm still thinking about it.
What are you afraid will happen?
I'm not that crazy.
You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
That is a marvelous image, Walter. Because by going in circles we find the things we missed the first time around.
How do you define it?
I know --
You don't know!
Please don't do it again.
I don't see --
I see my sister.
In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?
We're little kids.
I'm only asking questions.
That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.
All right. A small house... with small rooms.
Time.
I feel... okay.
Yeah, I'm fucking fantastic.
No weirder than a sharp, young, good- looking woman working in a lumberyard.
I'm just quiet.
What about them?
Yeah?
Don't you think I should know before we have sex?
Since you've had sex?
Maybe later.
I suffer from insomnia.
I molested little girls.
Between ten and twelve. Once a nine- year-old told me she was eleven. Once a fourteen-year-old told me she was twelve. I always asked how old they were.
Twelve years in prison?
I'm sorry, Walter.
Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
I've got problems.
Guess that makes you pretty special.
What's your fucking problem?
Fucking liar.
No way that could just be seawater.
Forget it, Sonny.  They're gone.
I... they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead. I thought... some of them... you know...
Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that angel comin' toward me.
You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
Do you always have to call him that?  The Suit? It makes you sound like such a hick.  His name is Michael.
I'm telling you what is there.  You're just not hearing.  The impulses somehow aren't getting from you ears to your brainpan.  There's something down there.  Something not... us.
I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry.
We all see what we want to see... Coffey looks and he sees Russians, he sees hate and fear. Bud, you have to look with better eyes than that.
Yeah, but it's gonna take them a while to find us.  We better get this flooding stopped.
Somewhere behind this panel.  Hold this.
We've only got one suit.
No way!  Forget it.  Not an option.
Monk, Schoenick... secure the package.
Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get something to breathe.
Missed what?
Just hold your water, okay?  So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk about it?
Wilhite, anything?
Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving.  We're on a tight timeline.
How many are there?
24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
Gimme a break!  Coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking Russian.
Going over the wall.  Coming to bearing 065. Everybody stay tight and in sight.
Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?
What kind of luminous things, Bud?
Check this out.
Through three miles of water?   I don't know.
What a question... Because I want to be with you, naturally. I hope he doesn't close the deal so he'll leave me alone at least for a few days... Isn't this water wonderful!
You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety.
There you go... Must you always spoil everything!
This one is gorgeous.
You already know what they are.
I understand very well. Only I don't want any rash assumptions to be made.
It takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca.
All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.
That's Patrizia's way of letting us know she's with us.
I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be that they're in love?
Yes, very much so.
But then when will we see each other?
I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia, is for us to be together.
Who knows why they all left...
I don't doubt it. But at a time like this we're the least suitable persons to be with him. And as far as telephoning him... Who knows where he is?
I deserve it.
I would say he's pretty depraved.
One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
It means being without money.
I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
But for what reason should I come there?
Please, do come... Don't leave me alone with him. He's capable of... I don't know... Have you noticed his eyes?
But why all nudes?
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
But why?... What if it starts to rain?
What do you think?
This is Claudia, Anna's friend...  You've never met my husband, have you?
Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
Anybody can hold a brush in his hand. All you need is to buy some oils and start painting. Even Rembrandt did the same.
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
So that's why you've turned to smuggling, eh? You need the money. Now, I can help you. I can see that you get some assistance from the government. But first there's a little formality we've got to take care of. Just a few questions and then we can all go to lunch... Your friend tells me you dropped anchor three times...
But for you, what comes first: music or love?
Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses, you'll need some rope and ladders...
And do you remember where she got off?
Good. Then I'll meet you there.
Now listen, if I had any information, I wouldn't have come here to ask you. But I see that you, too, lack any information ...
Yes... of course... But you should also print that in your paper... But right away, tomorrow morning... It's the local Palermo paper, isn't it?... I mean, it's widely read...
One of the other Sisters?
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
Who tells you these things?
Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
You've got to eat something Agnes.
What do you mean?
For what?
You've been alone together?
Where?
Yes I do,  but I want you to...
Then let's talk about something else...
Martha Louise Livingston.
No.
Would you like to be?
No.
I've stopped menstruating
What?
Well I think they come from... angel lights on their mothers chest and whispers into her ear. That makes good babies start to grow. And bad babies come from when a fallen angel squeezes in down there, and they start to grow, grow, till they come out down there. I don't know where good babies come out. And you can't tell the difference... except bad babies cry a lot... and they make their fathers go away... and their mothers get very ill... die sometimes.
What else did she tell you?
You have trouble sleeping?
Agnes...
No.
Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint... 
... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me.
I really love you.
As much as Mother Miriam does?
Because I'm in trouble.
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
I hate them.
A wastepaper basket.
I feel as if I've eaten glass.
From the belltower the day she before she died.
Yes.
Not your fault...
Agnes who did you see?
???
What?
Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
I'll have it.
Who are you?
Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves,  some wheat, corn, some vegetables.
Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?
Uh huh.
Who told you this?
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
Yes.
Obviously there was.
Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
I am not with the Inquisition.
That's ridiculous...
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
Not simple, no.
And I intend to take her away from Him. That's what you're afraid of isn't it?
... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are?  You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child.
I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud. 
I am...
Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court.
Oh, some time in January.
Was the child full term?
Oh, Dear God, I should have guessed...
I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
She molested her!
Oh, dear God.
Because I didn't know... 
The woman's health is at stake.
I don't give a damn about her spiritual health.
Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...
So you left the Church because you had freckles?
Fine thanks...
Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
Pipe!
Yes I do.
Become?  One is born a saint.
Listen to her singing.
My God, you're as crazy as...
Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
How  ?
This is insane.
But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
Where is she?
Too late for what?
The scandal...
You went to the room to help with the birth.
She didn't want any help.
... Oh, I'm all heart, Ma'am, all heart ... Well, I let ...
We'd be thrown out.
They are?
Are you now?
Not much cop without 'em, is it?
Yeah.
They'll be here.
Oh now, they can't do that to me.  It's all your fault.  Oh yes it is and if they don't turn up I wouldn't be in your shoes for all the...
Aren't you supposed to be in that box?
You never know, you might be lucky this time.
Oh, you can come off it with us. You don't have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our benefit.
And that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you won't meet Susan if you don't cooperate.
I beg your pardon?
Get him out of here. He's knocking the programme's image!!
Ah well. Eh, look!
Follow your impulse.
Oh, sorry I spoke.
I've got you worried, haven't I?
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
How'd you guess?
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
And you honestly think that's what she meant?
Oh, definitely, it sticks out a mile, she's trying to get him to marry her but he doesn't want ... well ... I don't reckon any fella's ever wanted to get married. But girls are like that, clever and cunning. You've got to laugh.
Yeah ... what's in it for me?
I'm not wrong.
What are they saying?
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
Why do you always use your left hand?
That little old man.
Him, he costs you a fortune in breach of promise cases. He's a villain and a right mixer as well.
Nothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind.
No.
Well you're not going.
You wouldn't!
I would though.
You're a swine. So hurry up ... we're travelling!
Hello.
No, I'm not.
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
Aye, but you know him well.
That's what you tell me.
Thanks.
Do I have to raise me voice?
It's not my fault.
Well, you stick to that story, son.
Who?
Down the ... er ...
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
I know, that's the trouble.
Oh, a little savage, is he?
Or something will be able to see us.
Activated.  Vertical drop checked. Correcting course.  On tangential course now, orbiting.  Crossing the terminator.  Entering night side.
Receiving.
Wretched.  What happened to me?
Yeah, okay.  Go ahead.
It couldn't translate the whole thing, only three phrases.  I'll just read it to you the way I got it:  "... HOSTILE... SURVIVAL... ADVISE DO NOT LAND... "  And that's all it could translate.
Shit...
It's still in the ship?
Well, we should at least be able to each buy our own planet.
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
And when will you be ready to do that?
I hope not.
Careful, don't get under it!
The door was closed.  It must still be in here.
How's Broussard?
He's running a fever.
Still unconscious?
The machine will bring his temperature down.  His vital functions are strong.
Got a better idea?
Thing is, I'm about out of fuel.
What we really need is some red meat in here for bait.
Whoever's doing the herding is gonna have their hands pretty full.  I think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it's inside, and to serve as... as... 
It's not going to work.
Well... this rock rotates every two hours.  The sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes.
All right.  Now just remember: keep away from those weapons unless I say otherwise.  Martin, do you read me?
Let's let the machine work on him.
I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.  Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen.
Let's get moving with this net.
All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  Okay?
About four hours.
Let's hear it.
Any microorganisms?
I don't even know what I'm looking for.
I've always respected your opinion, Martin.  If something worries you, it worries me.
Well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them...
Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!
With great pleasure.
Where are you?
It started crashing around right after we locked it in.
Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
The man would need protection, obviously -- as well as some way to drive the thing before him.
Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me.
No, I had to seal off a whole section.  We'd lose too much of our remaining air if we opened the connecting door.
But the idea's good, if we could just turn it around somehow.
No good... it's eaten too much of me...
It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!
Nah.  I just wanna squeeze off a few rounds.  'Sides, they tagged the rhinos for the migration project, so they're protected.  They'll dock you a month's pay for just mentioning it.
Oh man...
Shit.  When?
Yesterday.  We got the Network feed from Gateway; it was the top story on 'Sixty Seconds'.  Biggest market crash since twenty-four.
That's impossible, man.  This fence is high-tensile.  The breaking tolerance'd stand up to the strain of a rhino, easy. I know, I put it up.
I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.
It's moving slow.  About... eleven metres. On the left.
Auto-shop?
And, nothing.  They checked out just fine.
Well... try the headset.
I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.
Uh-huh.  Used to get it pretty bad.  I'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch.
I... I can't!
Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range.  They're making their own way back tomorrow.
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
Eddie what?
Oddly enough - she didn't say a word about Margo. Just that she'll be happy to do what she can to see that I play the part.
Stars.
That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
Addison, will you please say what you have to say plainly and distinctly - and then get out so I can take my nap!
Very well, plainly and distinctly. Although I consider it unnecessary - because you know as well as I, what I am about to say.  Lloyd may leave Karen, but he will not leave Karen for you.
What of it?
It is true that your parents were poor. They still are. And they would like to know how you are - and where. They haven't heard from you for three years...
I had lunch with Karen not three hours ago. As always with women who want to find out things, she told more than she learned...  ... do you want to change your story about Lloyd beating at your door the other night?
I don't think I'm going.
You're being childish.
Miss Caswell is an actress. A graduate of Copacabana School of Dramatic Arts.  Ah... Eve.
And too many of them are produced.
She may be later than you think...
Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell?
Then you two must have a long talk-
Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise.
It's good luck before an audition. She'll be all right once it starts.
I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
It just slipped your mind.
How nice for Lloyd. And how nice for Eve. How nice for everybody.
Huh?
Geniuses don't need good luck.  I do.
Show me a human and I might have!
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
How childish are you going to get before you quit it?
Then you're crazy.
Bill, you know how much I do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff...
And who remembered it? Who was there on the dot, at twelve midnight...?
The reading could have been better, but you said it - now "many happy returns of the day..."
She did...?
Okay.
I'll check with Eve...
You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
Well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about Hollywood, she seemed so interested...
I don't think that's funny!
She hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! So when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom, Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - I won't have it! Eve Harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love! And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of!
Cut! Print it! What happens in the next reel? Do I get dragged off screaming to the snake pit?
Eve?  How enchanting...  Wherever did you get the idea of having Eve read with Miss Caswell?
Such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little Nell from the country? Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt-
I am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts!
Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.
I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.
Then what would be enough?  If we were married?
That suddenly makes the whole thing believable.
I want everybody to shut up about Eve. Just shut up about Eve, that's all I want. Give Karen more wine...  ... never have I been so happy. Isn't this a lovely room? The Cub Room. What a lovely, clever name. Where the elite meet. Never have I seen so much elite - and all with their eyes on me. Waiting for me to crack that little gnome over the noggin with a bottle. But not tonight. Even Eve. I forgive Eve... there they go.
With the paper to prove it.
I'm going to have a home. Not just a house I'm afraid to stay in... and a man to go with it. I'll look up at six o'clock - and there he'll be... remember, Karen?
A foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady... that's for me. And no more make believe! Off stage or on... remember, Lloyd.  I mean it, now. Grown-up women only, I might even play a mother - only one child, of course, not over eight...  Lloyd, will you promise not to be angry with me?
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
I have a suggestion.  There's really not much time left - I mean, you haven't had a minute alone yet, and - well, I could take care of everything here and meet you at the gate with the ticket... if you'd like.
Of course not.
What have I got to do with it?
Everything.
You're always after truth - on the stage. What about off?
Of course!
You don't have to apologize for me!  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'...
An answer.
She thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?
My back's open.  Did the extra help get here?
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
Ours was one of the first. Erasmus Hall. I'm the president.
I'll just pick up the broken glass.
Don't bother.
I hope you don't mind my speaking to you...
Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.
You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?
Not at all.  Margo, this is Eve Harrington.
I'd like that.
Well... Miss Channing's affairs are in such good shape... there isn't enough to keep me as busy as I should be, really - not that I've ever considered anything that would take me away from her... but the other day - when I heard Mr. Fabian tell Miss Channing that her understudy was going to have a baby, and they'd have to replace her...
I think she would cheer.
Of course.
Well - if she's got to pick on someone, I'd just as soon it was me.
Oh, but there is-
- and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
- and you felt just like that talking to Addison.
Tell me. How did your lunch turn out - with the man from Hollywood?
Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is, really. If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison.
I wish I'd never met him, I'd like him to be dead... I want my friends back.
I'll never get over it.
I'd do much more - for a part that good.
'Remembrance'.
Not at all...
I was dreadful, Miss Channing, believe me - I have no right to be anyone's understudy, much less yours...
Thank you, Eve. I'd like a Martini - very dry.
Hello, Miss Channing.
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
I find these wisecracks increasingly less funny! 'Aged in Wood' happens to be a fine and distinguished play-
Autograph fiends! They're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes-
You've what?
I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down.
It get better! "- About the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched First Ladies of the Stage to encourage, shall we say - younger - actresses; about Miss Harrington's own long and unsupported struggle for opportunity-"
I can't believe Eve said those things!
With tears.
You'll be there, won't you.
Eve?
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
I wonder why.
I'm trying hard to follow you.
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
With gestures, of course.
Now just a minute-
The cynicism you refer to, I acquired the day I discovered I was different from little boys!
Margo!
I'm a human being, I've got some!
Old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy! And a phobia against truth!
Within your time, buster. Lloyd, honey, be a playwright with guts. Write me one about a nice, normal woman who shoots her husband.
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
- in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
I placed...?
An audition for the part we're replacing. What's-her-name, your sister...
Would you?
All you got to do is name it.
Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?
--what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen--
Right. Nixon didn't get where he got by being dumb--  --listen, that was a Watergate question--
I lived here all my life, I got a million contacts, but they're all bus boys and bellhops.
Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--
It's not us, they were scared before we got there.  What do we know?
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
--Haldeman I know, who else?
What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?
It's nothing personal, though. 
Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.
I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun.
--according to sources involved in the Watergate investigation. Beginning in the spring of 1971--
--jeeeeeeesus--
--what time is it?
Morning or night?
The telephone calls... we know about that.
The rest is Barker's bank records. It's mostly the eighty-nine thousand in Mexican cashier's checks--
Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man.
I called him from Washington. He's the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning.
He is not in the car.  Sorry.
Mind if I try?
I've got a lot of energy.
They never told me anything except my own role--I had to find out the rest in the papers.
I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Miami.
And?--
--Deep Throat?--
--it makes the break-in real--it's a major goddamn story--  --I'm not going to kick ass over this, but I'd like you to know I hate getting beat, I just hate it-- don't forget that I hate it--
--what about you?--
Where are your bills, Carl?
Lot of pressure at the Star.  Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this.  How much did the damn bike cost?
You're two months behind--you got enough to cover?
You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl?
Anyplace really public, they'd know about it--they know everything at the Committee, Carl--
FBI too?
If you don't like it down there, why don't you quit?
I never worked for Sloan or Stans.
The ones who could disburse the money.
Irwin? I really feel bad, doing something like this--you know that, don't you?
Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
I'm not your source on that.
Probably you're right, but a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars.
Are you implying you don't believe me?
I see. And how do you think it reached Miami?
You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?
Follow the money. Always follow the money.
In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.
Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.
Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens? The break-in and the cover up, of course Mitchell knew, but no more than Ehrlichman.
Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti.
And Justice and FBI know all this?
Are you sure?
No.
Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.
Two o'clock, work the phones 'til you go.
Don't know; who the hell's Howard Hunt?  It's probably nothing but check it out. Just go easy, it could be crazy Cubans.
I can't sell hints to Simons--  --you called everyone you know?  Call someone you don't know.
That was awhile ago.
--maybe I'm tense--
No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
Well, when Liddy came and asked for money for what turned out to be the break-in funds, I went to the safe and gave him--out of this whole fortune--I happened to give him the same hundreds he gave me--banks have to keep track of hundreds. If the money had been in fifties, or if I'd grabbed a different stack, there probably wouldn't have been any Watergate story.
Oh, well...  It came from the heart.
I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge off, doesn't it?  And where might your date be?
No idea.
Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
Yeah.  Right, uh-huh.  I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.  Music is so expressive.
Do I have to?
Yeah, me too, okay, cool.
Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk.
I wasn't making fun of you.
That's nice.
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
Alright...yeah...thanks for understanding.  So I guess...I'll see you later.
You called me Oz.
Are you kidding?  You've never double- clicked your mouse?
Of course.
No, a <u>pact</u>.  No money involved.  This is more important than any bet.  Now here's the deal: We all get laid before we graduate.
Yeah, enormous.
Come on, Jim.  Where are you?
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
Okay, okay.  I'll let you hit those books.
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
Yes.  Seriously.
Highly, highly overrated.
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.
Bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night, blinded...
Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.
Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
Okay.
I suppose that would be okay.
Yes, slowly.
Um...okay...
Me?  Nothing.  I'm the one whose ass he kicked.  I'll tell you one thing, though.  I don't think he's gonna have a problem shitting in school anymore.
I think you're so right, Kevin.
Kevin...  I want to have sex with you.
Yeah.
I love you.
Yeah.
What?
Dude, prom sucks.
Yep.
You try to be a good sport, and look what happens.
A-duh... You're a werewolf. And we, as your victims, have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted.
Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.
Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
If you leave it for more than a few minutes it locks up. Now I must reboot and type a dozen fucking passwords. He was security crazy.
Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
And who's Claude?
Maybe I didn't know him like you did. But he's my uncle. And I owe it to him to get some answers. It's a quest like, uh, Hemingway, the Old Man and The Sea. Except instead of an old man I'm a young man, and instead of the sea, it's a bunch of tunnels under Paris. And instead of a big fish it's... who knows? That's what I'm going to find out. Au revoir.
Are you okay?
Listen, I'm coming over. Don't go anywhere. Stay right there.
A cure?
I had to be a damn Hemingway hero. Well I'll tell ya, the old man and the sea didn't go through half this shit.
I don't know...
Guess that's why he hid it there. Let's go.
Really.
What?
Well, they are French.
Let's go from both ends. We'll cut him off.
You too.
FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
My uncle's in a coma you moron!
What, you think Claude hangs out underground cause he likes to dance?
And you call me a moron...
Why isn't it doing anything!?
I leave these open. Maybe something comes back to you.
I know. I'm Andy McDermott. Terrence's nephew.
You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
Yeah well, that's like really groovy and everything, but who hacked my uncle's legs off?
Yeah, well if I claw my face off, just pack it in ice, okay? Jesus... the cops were probably right. My uncle was messed up with a bunch of fry brains and they went berserk on him.
I told him it wasn't ready...
Yeah. Look, uncle Terrence -
The ADM! Quickly! Where is it?!
That's McDermott, but yeah.
Right. Listen, my uncle, it's not serious is it? Did he eat some bad snails? Slip on the bidet? What?
Yeah, well, these fleas must have teeth like fuckin' chain saws.
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
Puking on yourself in midair is not a good death.
Oh, did I hurt the little girl's feelings? Well excusez moi... I confess my desire for ADM is quite "intense". So I deceived you and our poor friend Terry - a competent technician, but let's face it, a bit naive. "The great cure for lycanthropy!" Hmph. He didn't have the vision to grasp the potential of ADAM, until it was too late. And even then, he came rushing down to tell me, as if I would be just as shocked! Ha.
I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri?
Good day!
I'm fine.
I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.
Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
I was all out of dynamite!
It's the best fork of all
It used to be a private yacht before the government took it over.
I'm glad you	did too.
No, no child... shush... it's all right ...
No, not about the ceremony, Anastasia - do you understand the choice you must make.
Okay... you're not gonna like this but, well, it looks like Anastasia is ... still alive.
Shut up!
He's her?
Look!
Watch me.
I know, I know ... you thought I was dead. That's how the history books will remember me - not as the ruler of all of Russia, which I SHOULD HAVE BEEN - but as the guy who was never dead when you expected him to be.
How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
Remove him at once.
Oh, Dmitri.I wish that I could.
Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
Perhaps you could convince her?
You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?
Come on.
Alvy Singer. It was nice nice... Thanks very much... for everything.
I took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a meeting with Charlie. You take a meeting with him.
Alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life.
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
Well, why not?
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
Well, stop listening to him.
M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.
I-you know, I don't wanna.
I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.
Talk to him. You speak shellfish!  Hey, look... put it in the pot.
Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera.
You know, I-I think... if I could pry this door off... We shoulda gotten steaks 'cause they don't have legs. They don't run around.
Oh - you're an actress.
No, no, no, no, you just... just watch the road. I'll get it-
Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.
Oh, you do?
Yeah, my grammy.
Yeah. Oh, God bless!
Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?
You're gonna sing? Do you sing? Well, no, it isn't  No kidding?  this is my first time. Oh, really? Where? I'd like to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, I'm interested!
No, so help me.
Yeah.
Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure.
"There goes another novel."  Jesus, you were great.
You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me.
I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
Yeah?
M'hm. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?
You- Do you love me?
All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.
How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh? 
It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it.
Well, have you ever made love high?
Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
Who cares? Who cares?
And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
G-go on, I'm interested.
Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.
Yeah?
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
Are you okay?  What's the matter?  Are you all right? What-
I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
It was just great!
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
Hey, what am I-your son? Whatta you mean? I-I came over to --
It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.
Oh, darn it.
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
Yeah, I know. Just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just...
Don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were-
Well, I've been moody and dissatisfied.
Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
Well... H-h huh... Oh, good... Yes, I'll tell him.
Boy, this is really a nice screening room. It's really a nice room.
I'm cool.
Tsch, I know. A relationship, I think, is-is like a shark, you know? It has to constantly move forward or it dies.  And I think what we got on our hands  is a dead shark.
Well, let's see now... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine.
I'm late.
This is my room.
Oswald and ghosts.
Oh, sex with you is really a kafkaesque experience.
He's screaming his opinions in my ear.
...as opposed to a print...
No, I don't! You know, I was in a record store. Listen to this- so I know there's this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and he's lookin' at me in a funny way and smiling and he's saying, "Yes, we have a sale this week on Wagner." Wagner, Max, Wagner- so I know what he's really tryin' to tell me very significantly Wagner.
Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here.
I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy...  I feel dizzy, Max.
No, no, I came out here to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis, so I... He's my-my food taster. Have you two met?
But she's colored.
If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
We're going to take them to the airport.
Uh, well, I'd like to talk to you about that sometime, if you get a chance.
Well, hey, that's, that's nice. Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? Uh... and... uh... Tony Lacey.
Yeah.
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
Oh.
Yeah.
Uh, how did this personality come about?
Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.
Oh yes.
Would it make a difference?
Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and...  The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?
How nice for everybody.  Come swimming. The water's glorious.  You'll fix it.  You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas.
I...wait, what are you talking about?
I'd love a Xanex.  Sally, please don't tell Sophia that I'm not breast feeding.
Never.
Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis.
Are you the funniest person I know, or what?
What a nose.  You missed your calling.
Oh, very jealous.
And?
Leave us alone right now.
You're crazy baby.  I love you.
Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you.
It was fifteen seconds.
I don't think so.
I know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.
We'll be fine.
Ryan's novel.
Panes is not on your team anymore.
Otis!!!!
It's a novel.
Who the fuck do you think you are?  The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life.  Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally.
You don't have to.
He's my favorite.
Come on, Panes...
It's a novel.
I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you read the new Styron?
And I you.
Ah.
Mmm hmmm.
He's the best dog in the world.  They're both coming tonight.  Not my idea.
Right away.  Are you sure you wouldn't like something soft, Ryan?
In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.
A little out of my element.
No you're not.
Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction.
I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating.
Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was more generous, actually.
I will treasure this.
Medallions.
Come here.
Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us...
We have to find the dog, Ryan.
What?
Sally?
Yes.
Oh?
Exactly!  So I dug it, and I did a lot of research.
You see, that's worse.
It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
Like the last time.
No.  Really.  For real.  Really.
Yes.  Fine.
Why not?
Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.  And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.
That's not an answer, is it?
Yes, you're a monster.
From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle...
Well today it was Otis.  And you should keep him away from our yard.  Because Sheila will defend herself.
I hope they're watercolors!
The both of you.
She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.
I trust you.
Well good.  Thank God.
Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
No, no, not at all... I mean I've still got plenty of time.  Don't I?  I mean I still have a good six years, whatever. We could have three kids yet, if we wanted.  And I know I've always said I never wanted kids, and I didn't... but this year, I really, truly, feel ready...
No you are not.  You're Sally Nash. Listen to me, you're Sally Nash.  You're my best friend and I love you more than anyone, and you're not going to move to London to have the offspring of a sexually ambivalent man-child.  "Oh now I'm a novelist, oh now I'm a director..." English prick bastard Joe Therrian who's probably going to leave you for Skye Davidson anyway.
Mmm, yes, I see what you mean...
Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.
Z?  <u>Our</u> Z?  The little guy made it!
That's right!  He slaughtered hundreds of termites single-handedly!
Invisible!
Oh...and I was afraid we had nothing in common...
Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
Aren't you gonna stand up for yourself?
Let me think.  Hmmnn...  Never.  Bye!
I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
Want a list?
Listen, "Princess", you can't order me around.  Out here, you're not the boss anymore -- out here, you're just --
Well, I...I know it's a little strange, but...I thought it might come in handy if I...needed a scarf someday.  Well, to be honest, I just liked having it.
I know it's crazy, but -- I can't just leave.  Don't argue with me.  If I've learned anything, it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world.  Or beans.  Something like that.  Anyway, I've <u>got to warn the others</u>.
A <u>few</u>?
No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.  I can't feel my legs...
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
Royal victory party?  Will...will Princess Bala be there?
Oh, hey, that's great, I think I see an old war buddy over there, it's been fun chatting.  Good luck with the hallucinations.
Yes, General Formica.  Carry on, my good man!  I don't know what we would do without you.
'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.
I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.
I can't think of any.
Yeah, I know.
What do I do?
Don't tell anyone you're a worker. Follow that column over there.  And come right back after the inspection!
Sheldrake?
I've been here twice as long as you have --
I sort of like it.
You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.
Why not? Now that they're kicking me upstairs --
No.
This date -- is it just a date -- or is it something serious?
It used to be serious -- at least I was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.
Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
So I see.
Thank you.  I thought you were avoiding me.
You couldn't help yourself. I mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man. You did the only decent thing.
Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're tops. I mean, decency-wise -- and otherwise-wise.  Cheers.
I thought so.
Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
I think so.
All right. Have a nice Christmas.
It's not important, Fran -- the main thing is that I got here in time -- and you're going to be all right --  -- isn't she, Doc?
Let me help you.
Where's my dress? I have to go home.
I just want to go brush my teeth --
Who?
In his apartment.
They had to pump it out.
Thanks for reminding me.
Open it.
Cut.
Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
I think you should. I have to run down to the grocery anyway -- all that's left around here is one frozen pizza --  I'll be right back -- okay?
Oh.
Thank you.
I know so. He's a taker.
You did?
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
Where?
Here.
Oh, no. Sometimes I have dinner with Ed Sullivan, sometimes with Dinah Shore or Perry Como -- the other night I had dinner with Mae West -- of course, she was much younger then.  Cheers.
I'm fine all over.
Don't worry about Dr. Dreyfuss -- I happen to know he was out on a case.
Yes, sir.
That's very flattering.
I don't know.
You do?
Who?
How do you work it with the key?
Well -- I guess so.
No, you don't understand. She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
No, sir. That's very unfair -- especially to your wife.
Yeah.  You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --
Sir?
Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast -- I'm very pleased -- especially for Miss Kubelik. Now that I've gotten to know her better, I think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody --
Oh?
You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
What do you mean, sorry?
So what's it going to be?
Now hold on, Baxter --
Save it. The old payola won't work any more. Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
Yes?
I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
I don't mind in the summer -- but on a rainy night -- and I haven't had any dinner yet --
Listen to him.  Little Lord Fauntleroy!
Well -- it's all right with me, Bud. Let me check. I'll get back to you.
No!
That's okay, Buddy-boy.  Now like I was saying, I'm in this joint on Sixty-first -- and I think I got lucky --  -- she's a skater with the Ice Show --  -- and I thought maybe I could bring her up for a quiet drink.
And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.
Well, after all, it's my apartment -- it's private property -- it's not a public playground.
Look, Mr. Vanderhof -- I've got you down here for tonight -- but I'm going to be using the place myself -- so I'll have to cancel.
Cancel? But it's her birthday -- I already ordered the cake --
That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were.
Aren't you?
How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?
Me? Oh, you mean my body. Don't worry, Doc -- it'll go to the University -- I'll put it in writing --
Booze we don't need. Why don't you join us, Baxter? We got two brain surgeons, an ear, nose and throat specialist, a proctologist, and three nurses from Bellevue.
Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.
Yeah. What's Buddy-boy done for us lately?
Dr. Dreyfuss.
I took sleeping pills.
No.
Yes, I know.
Do I. That leaky little boat you rented -- and me in a black negligee and a life preserver --
What do you think?
And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --
What are you talking about?
Don't you ever stop talking?
Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?
Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia -- instead of Friday - could we make it Thursday night?
It won't happen again.
Propagate -- you know, multiply -- baby flies?
Captain Willard -- go ahead.
I'm not that fond of blondes -- maybe I like brunettes --
Esprit de corps --
You can keep your fucking fuel --
Get out --
Delta ?
Let's talk about you.
A year ? Waiter another beer.
Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.
Chef -- is that 'cause you like mangoes an' stuff?
Sure.  Recoil... I feel the recoil of my rifle.
Beats me -- the sun was too much for him, or the mud. Who knows ?
In the middle of the jungle -- a goddamn light.
Ours.
Yeah, it still runs.
Charlie?
NVA regulars. They're coming again tonight. Tet -- their big -- assault.
This gentleman or myself ?
Do you know that jungle?
What about an American named Kurtz?
Your daughter.
What, sir?
Hell's Angels Four to Big Duke Six -- we'll need green smoke -- suggest you have the FAC mark it.
Haven't got time, Hell's Angels -- lay it right up the tree line.
I met him.
He musta changed !  I got to get into the Nung River, here or here.
What about this point here?
The truth that you were sent here to murder me, ans so far you haven't done it. And do you know why?  Yes, you know why.  Your mission makes about as much sense as those idiots who sent you on it. Asshole ! Schmuck ! How long does it take you to figure out that nobody knows what they're doing here.  Except me.
You know what you're doing? You are interfering with my plans !
Oh Captain, that is so true.
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
I'm taking you back.
Yes I was... He said his last words to me.
What?
A Yater spoon is hard to get -- especially here.
And you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped?
That's me.
Simple. They don't want him to go.
Kurtz.  I know you've heard of him.
Yes.
But Captain, I mean -- cannibals.
Anyone got a card?
Needs patching.
134  CONTINUED:  
175  CONTINUED:
So they can patch me up and put me in a cage?  Forget it. Meyerling's right -- I'm a dinosaur.  Greedy bastards like him, it's their turn with this land.  Put me in the woods, let me live or die on my own.
Keep back.
He still might be around.  I saw fresh tire tracks coming in.
No way can he get away with this. I'll be back by tonight.
You make it sound like a prison sentence.
Look, why get into this again. As long as it's working, let's leave it alone.  It's been nice so far.  We're together --
Come here...
That's my line.
Where's Corbett?
I got your plate number, asshole. Maybe you feel like spending a few months in jail.
We've got another two hours of daylight.
Going to be a bit of a challenge with handcuffs on.
You know Meyerling?
If that means freeze my balls off, no thanks.  I'll be okay.
You don't know how true that is.
I liked you better frozen.  You didn't talk so much.

Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.
I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
Will you rent me a cabin, or not?
I'm the one should be sorry... Goddamn Kenai, always out for a score.  I never should've let him go over there.
This isn't your concern.  It's over, here and now.
Ease off.  We do this my way.
You met the gift.
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
No.
Spence.
You're not worried that someone might take him?
Sorry.
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
Just how grateful I am.
Hey, what I did for you is working out?
You take off when you have to.
Are you still coming?
Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good night.
Hello... Oh, my God, who did that to you?
Welcome.
Anybody here who's interested in what Melvin has to say raise their hands.
That wasn't payment. When you first came into breakfast, when I saw you -- I thought you were handsome... Then, of course, you spoke... So now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. Tell me, why did you bring me?
I should've danced with you.
Maybe we could live without the wise cracks.
But you're beautiful... your skin glows.
That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
I'll take care of myself --
There's not going to be a debate. You must leave.
What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?
Thanks for looking after him.
Like the wind but I'm not doing it.
Well, I can't reach them.
You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.
Where'd they teach you to talk like this -- some Panama City "Sailor want to hump-hump bar"? Or was today getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey. Sell crazy some place else -- we're all stocked up here.
Get out.
Never a break. Never.
This stuff is pointless.
I know. I'm a little bit nervous. Suddenly everything seems so easy. Carol, a load has been lifted.
It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.
No...  Okay. What I do is watch and wait for, um... You ever watch someone who doesn't know you're watching...  an old woman on a bus, kids going to school and you see this flash come over them and you know immediately that it has nothing to do with anything external -- that it's in respond to a private thought they just had? They are just sort of realer and more alive. And when you notice it so are you. If you look at someone long enough, you discover their humanity.
Yes...  well, there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good.
Right.
Didn't you here all them sirens? It's been all over the radio.  Some guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the Trattoria Roma.
You can't --
There's a sand barricade up ahead; I'm going to ram this cab into it. The cab has an airbag, odds are good I'll survive.  But with this steel casing and bullet proof glass, odds for you are not so good.
What?
You're too late.
No.  No.  No.  I don't believe it.
A new player.  He's using the name Nicholai.
I know.  It was a joke.
He stole another contract.
We have an M.O... Her system is protected by her 'pussy virus.'
Um, five.
Yeah?
You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
Someone hired both of you?
We don't have a choice.
No.  Just Electra.
He was Russian.  Nicholai Tachlinkov.  A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him.  When I heard he loved chess I became obsessed with the game.
He was killed.
I was just different.
Ahhhh...
Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.
Then you went freelance?
No.  Just the first one.
I don't.
Yes.
I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.
You should.  It's very important, that the body release the energy that builds in it.
Then, we wait.
What?  What if he brings it with him?
That's right.
What?
What did he say?
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
And you were drilling these holes...?
What?
Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
Attraction is a complication?
No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.
When did it start?
Shit.
Oh, God.  I see it!
I think you're supposed to answer that question.
It's possible.
Right.
Can I ask you a question?
It's okay, they're training me on the cash register and after I hope to work on one of the jewellery counters.
We're only joking.....It is your round though!
No, just crap. I want some picture frames.
An alternative literary venue!
No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place?
So? DOUG Well, there's tons of empty buildings - why don't we get one?
No thanks, I think we ought to get going though.
I don't know man, I'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.
You got my word on it.
Scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. If there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.
And put it on expenses?
No.....But I think Honza at the office has. You keep shifting this crap and I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. Take a break for lunch and I'll catch you up later.
No....The Asylum!
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
See if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls, give it a bit of atmosphere.
Like helping a sick kid?
What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
You should have said it was Bring-A-Bottle.
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
I can't, I've got to split. I have to take a class at two o'clock.
I fell in love.
Well, I take it you're going to drag her down to your minimal existence and adjust her mindset.
What?
Huh?
Damn!
I don't know, I'm waiting for the transcript.
So?
What happened to those disks I gave you, have you still got them?
Yeah, somewhere?
Do you know the way?
Yeah, pretty well.
Yeah!
Follow that Budjovice sign.
Regards to Her Majesty.
Sure, they wanted to know if I ever voted Conservative.
We should be done by the weekend.
Ooh, well excuse me.
Whatever!
What? You are crazy!
Fernet and tonic.
Okay.
Great. And your all set for the performance?
Don't go making it too simple, we're on the cutting edge here.
I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.
Well she sure isn't normal.
We_re not all running away
Sure!
Run into Josh?
It's Josh's.
Cool....Either of you know the way to Krakow?
Fuck you!
Really!
Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
Yeah.
Shit Honey, you could've told me. People might think it's about us!
Can we talk in your office?
I don't understand it, there were a lot of people there last night, many Americans, I believe we should move carefully.
I don't think you realise what will happen if those files are made public. The lives of thousands of officers depend on the secrecy of those records, including your own now.
It was all on a Russian format, I don't think that would be so easy; we must take that chance.
Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
I'm sorry about how we --
And I have no idea why.
About a job.
I don't want his money.
I can't know things if you don't tell me.
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
Yeah.
You do. You're handsome and charming.
He wants to talk to you.
No. Hey. We're sorry, man!
'They won't.'
'Believe in yourself and they will. Let me ask you, Lizzie. Look in the mirror? Are you pretty --?'
This play -- ?
You think so.
Interpreted by another guy like my father.
Healthy as can be.
And why would that scare me?
That what's happening to you, only faster?
You're sometimes not sure?
The truth. I just left you out of it.
Yes. I try to keep my power.
Yes, one of many.
I'm not going back to school.
That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you.
Does it have to do with Jamie?
I'm not tired.
Where did you get -- ?
Show me some respect, you little asshole. It's Special Officer Tannen to you.
Uh, yes, sir...
Fine.
Mom, how else are we gonna see the sunrise?
Oh, I'm feeling much better now.
But he didn't ask me.
Coming, Eileen...
Okay, then!
Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear?
Hey, Mr. Arky, gimme a break!  I'm seventeen years old! I'm not responsible for all these problems!
Well, yeah, I was thinking, if cars are gonna be going two or three hundred miles an hour, they're gonna be using an awful lot of gas. Like, what if we run out?
Run out of gas?
March 11th.
What's this all about?
Oh -- Marty -- what time did you say it was?
Oh, right, right... 
Yeah, a shopping mall. You know, a shopping mall?
Oh. That expression probably hasn't been invented yet... I can get behind -- I agree with you.
Believe me, Professor, running around on a nuclear test site can't be any more dangerous than what I've been doing.
But that's impossible!! George asked her out! He had to! I saw him walk her home! Oh, God!
Jesus!
That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
What theater was I at?
The Orpheum.
What? 
Me neither. I've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married. You think yours did?
What did you do to your hair?
Gone?... Where?
You don't mind?
Well, I don't notice us hustling trash, either.
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
Well. I got some stuff to say. Guess I'm kind of lucky that way. Most people don't have anything on their minds, do they?
Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage.
Yeah?
Kids eat that kind of stuff in Korea.
How bad off is he?
You said that once already... Too late now.
Put that down. It's dirty.
I got him in the stomach.
Yeah.
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
Well, I shouldn't expect miracles, should I?
Sure.
Planet 10?
There's a Harley behind those bushes.  Get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula.  We don't have time to ask questions. Just synthesize it-
So I was right.  That's nice to know...
Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...
Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
He offered you money?
You.  Like the papers all say.
No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
Any time.
Go where?  Where're you going?
Absolutely.
That's just what you would say.  This is so unreal.  I'm dreaming...
I have a radio fix...
Jammed--? By who? Whom by?
Should we be on Code Red?
Barton. You see, Barton, I'm not just Bill's secretary  Bill and I are... I love. We-
What?! He's a son of a bitch!
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
Before Bill came to Hollywood.
That doesn't help anything, Bill.
Not anything, Bill. Don't test me.
A week, eight, nine days 
He... I'm trying to think... Nothing, really... He... He said he liked Jack Oakie pictures.
Mmm. Wal, me, I just enjoy maikn' things up. Yessir. Escape... It's when I can't write, can't escape m'self, that I want to tear m'head off and run screamin' down the street with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail. Mm...
I'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp, brick by brick. Raisin' up a levee to keep that ragin' river of manure from lappin' at m'door.
I said drown 'em all! Who is that?
Okay. I'm just having trouble getting started. It's funny, I'm blocked up. I feel like I need some kind of indication of... what's expected 
What do you do far a living?
Yeah, I'm fine, Garland  I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance.
Not big in the sense of large  although it's that too. I mean important. This may be the most IMPORTANT work I've done.
Have you read the Bible, Garland?
All right, hell, you trying to work and me carrying on in there. Look, the liquor's good, wuddya say?
Damned difficult, I'd imagine.
Doesn't surprise me at all.
Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying  a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!
Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, I'll let you know if I'm bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view.
Well, we've got something in common then.
See you, Charlie.
Charlie. How are you.
Nope.
That's all right, really 
Well, that's all that wrestling is. Except usually there's more grunting and squirming before the pin. Well, it's your first time. And you're out of your weight class.
Hi, Charlie.
Because that would mean they gave you mine.
You're leaving?
Funny, huh, when everything that's important to a guy, everything he wants to keep from a lifetime  when he can fit it into a little box like that. I guess... I guess it's kind of pathetic.
I'm at the Earle.
No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help 
Colonel Lipnik, if you don't mind.
What do you do, Fink?
He's a little funny in the head.
All of which he's now missin'.
But, you know, with the head still on.
You don't look so okay.
No, Nick, please --
Yeah?  Well why don't you find some friendly therapist and work some of that hostility out.  But take my advice.  Put a little more life into it than you usually do.
I had him in two classes.
She's evil.  She's brilliant.  Be careful, Nick.
That's right.
It's got to be tiring to beat that machine.
They were drug buys.  I was a vice cop.
She wiped out her whole family.
I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
Do you?
What if I call you Nicky?
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
What do you want from me, Catherine?
A boy kills his parents.  They have a plane.  He makes it look like an accident.
Yes.
No.  I wrote it years afterwards.
I'll risk it.
I thought it was a pretty good beginning.
Do you want her to join us sometime?
I told you I had a vivid imagination.
No more games, Nick.  I'm tired of playing games!
I don't know.
I'll convince you.
I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
Did you miss me?
I'm very good at research.  I'll help you.
No thanks.
Why?
What is this -- some kind of... Joke?  Are we playing games again?
We fuck like minks.  We forget the rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
What are you going to do?  Charge me with smoking?
No.
I'm a writer,  I use people for what I write.  You write what you know.  Let the world beware.
Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.
Nilsen?
He had a girlfriend?
Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.
Not now he don't.
She want to play?  Fine.  I can play.
What in the hell for?  You think I'm gettin' any at my age?  I don't like blue-haired women.  I don't like 'em.
I don't know.  I'm just not.
That's her pussy talkin' --He gets a real nasty look from a very fat woman eating a cheeseburger.  He winks at her.  The woman looks away from him, shaking her head.
You're my friend, Gus.
He was I.A.  He probably asked her about it.
He ain't that way.  He's got heart.
What was it?
What about me?
No.
You don't but it, do you?  She knew nobody would but it.  She knew I'd say she did it.  And she knew nobody would buy it.
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them.
Gee. I don't need to. You're a natural. You should sign up with my modeling agent.
You think those are good presents? Who wants an old wig?
How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
I don't like beer.
I really think you should talk to him about this.
Not what?
Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
Really?
Why don't you try letting her in, Steve  I mean Shenge.
Who am I?
Thanks.  Your dad called again  something about a job.
Your people.
Oh man! Folklore guy  worked on the railroad. Y'know, pounding in spikes and laying down track. Then one day they invented a machine to do it. And he says "Fuck that, I'm a MAN" and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track. It takes two days. Neck and neck the whole time. They get right to the end, and he beats it by one spike.  Got a cigarette?
What's your fuckin' problem, anyway?
You mean babies with you?
You want three Big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
I'll take it.  Andy, gimme three thousand dollars.  Just the caviar  I'll get the rest.
That's great.
Hi.
Wanna Mac?
Haitian. I'm going to kill myself. I'm taking pills. Reds, blues, greens.
No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get.
Can you put me in the ring with him?
Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
So what?
I sculpt. I'm really just starting to find myself. How old are you? Twenty? You're just like I used to be. I'm forty-one. And I'm glad I haven't gotten any recognition. It gave me time to develop.
Uh-oh!
You mean mistook <u>me</u>?
Well, I could ... free up some time...
I'm listed.
"We"?  You and...
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
Had one.  Didn't work.
Nope, I told her everything.
Sure.
If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
No hard feelings?
Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
I'm not scared of you, Max.
Wayne, I'll not stand for mud- slinging in this office.  If my assistant were here, she'd already have escorted you out, to --
Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City.
My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
One way to find out?
Fred.  Fred?  He's ... actually he's been on an extended vacation, and --
I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
Point is, listen to them.  They've lost faith in old symbols. They're ready to bond with you, the icon of the future.  If it works, don't fix it...
I think you'd feel out of place at my party.  You see, it's for winners.
And a very, very good one.
Too good?
That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
The boys need help.
Women.
Specify, please.
You'd be surprised.
What are you talking about?
Happy.  You honestly don't know, do you? You can't even see what's in front of your own eyes.
I hate being lectured.
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
No, Robin.  He's going to jail.
How about, nice to see you?  Glad you're here to save my life.
I'm totally over her.  Positively.
Open Sesame...Chicken.
Can he save her?
What can I do for you, Doctor?  A research grant?  A hospital wing?
Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
Acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet.
What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
Well...um...her.
Yes.  But Alfred's condition is less severe.  Freeze's research says he cured a case like Alfred's.  It just doesn't say how.
Dick, don't push me right now.
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
As a team, the duncely duo protect each other.  But the Robin is young. Impetuous.  If I could get him alone-
You're skating on thin ice.  My passion thaws for my bride alone.
I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
Tell me and I'll kiss you.
Love you?  I loathe your bipedal arrogance, your animal superiority. My only joy is knowing that even now my poison kiss is sucking the life from your ape-like face.
Hello, Jason.  I think I've had a change of heart.
Apology hastily retracted.
Don't be ridiculous.
Why, indeed?
How? As Batman, knowing she wants me? Or as Bruce Wayne and hope...?
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.
Recognition, of course.
How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
Master Wayne's dead wives.
Exactly!
Precisely. What's on all our minds? Brainwaves. The future of Wayne Enterprises is Brainwaves!
So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes.
And into a black dress.
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...
I said I'm sure he did.
Why do I feel like the other man, here?
What?
Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your fees are a little rich for me.
Spare me the diagnosis, okay? You're being ridiculous. I can't be jealous of Batman.  Can I?
What are you talking about?
I figure telling that cop I'd stay here saved me a truckload of social service interviews and good will. So no offense but thanks. See ya.
Who is it?
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
You're right, Edward. I didn't mean to be impolite. Please.
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
WHICH CAR?
Too many people. Come on!  SHIELDS!!
Great.  Give me a grant.
You're just back from Corto Maltese.  I saw your combat photos.  Quite a departure for you.
Then stay away from Vicki. That's all I want, man. I just want your word.
I'll take you home if you'd like.
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
... Where are you calling from?
I suggest a nice big bomb.
Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration.
Very good idea, Jack.  In fact --  -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.
Huh. Demands. Well, gents, this is kinda embarrassing, but... I'm having such a swell time, I just haven't thought any up.
... Behind the makeup?
Honey - - I would know any randomly selected square inch of Vicki Vale.  If I had a good enough hint.
Too much glamor, huh.  What's in the bag - - Monte Carlo?  Apes in Kenya?
I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
You okay?
And what did you say?
Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.
That's exactly what I said ... before I said - Great, it's a sensational idea."
What's wrong with you, David?  All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.
0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know.
I know... I know. I've been an arsehole of spectacular proportions. Olympic standard.
Well, Ahm....
But the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the program to every room in the gallery.
She's ... well, she's good.
Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this.  I'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that.
And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.
I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.
We have.  In fact, we've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world.
I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
Yes, although, I really..... thank you.  Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.
I'm fired?  Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...
And I need Fridays off, to spend more time with my family.  Speaking of which - if you'll excuse me .... I've got a lot of time to make up.
Welsh.
Sean Connery.
No - but when you've torn out a man's throat with your bare hands, you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life.
You.
Dammit! I need a TV now! We're missing everything!
Uh... maybe he's blind... Huh huh, check this out.
Me first?
Huh huh. We're gonna score now.
Yeah, heh heh, enough'a this crap.
Yeah, it's just the same thing over and over again.
Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.
Uh... I think I'm seeing something too. It's like a really long time ago...
Heh heh. Bye bye. Heh heh.
Turd-burglar...
Huh huh. You guys are funny. Let's have a drink on it.
Washington! That's where she was gonna meet up with ya?  Damn, she's goin' all the way!
Oh, that's nice.
He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
Deep and hard.
That's better. Yes?
Bork, when this is all over, remind me to make you an appointment with Agent Hurley.
Uh, Butt-Head.
That's right. I'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
You scored with two chicks?!
Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we could do you. And he was gonna pay us.
Slow down there, honey... I don't want the vibration to weaken the model.
I am sitting.
Two hours.
Look at the publisher.  Handbook for the Recently Deceased Press.
Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do?
What about this Beetle guy?
Are you crazy?  She can't hear you.
Bet... el... geuse.  What an awful name.  I thought it was like -- you know.  The <u>juice</u> of <u>beetles</u>.
N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots.
But he didn't.  We've got him where we want him.
I didn't --
Can you scare them off?
Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go!
We have to start simpler, is that it?
We're...
Are you Juno, our case worker?
Yes.  I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
Yes.
Our cemetery?
Yes.
You've got to help them.

Otho, why didn't you just come in the door?
There's only one Chinese restaurant in town, darling, the owners are Irish and Irish people happen to cook Cantonese.  They don't know better.
Lydia, we're the first trickle! In a couple of years this whole town will be <u>filled</u> with people like us.
Lydia.  Try to be civil.  I'm going to see if I can set up a noise-free zone in the study.
... asked you for something, didn't she?  I'm going down to relax.  I want a noise-free zone. Do you understand?  Noise free.
<u>This is not a joke</u>!  That sheet was full of ghosts.
No listen... we'll talk about this visiting later, I gotta go, I gotta meeting on the Japanese joint venture.
Yeah yeah, we'll think on it. 'Bye ya, Charles.  You relax up there, ya hear?
I say let's keep it the way it is.
That's Charles' study.  But you don't have to even look in there. He'll love whatever you do to it.  He's such a sheep.
Remind me to talk to your mother about the dress code.  I'm sure you're going to be very happy there.
It's okay.  How's the dirt business?
Well, I just placed a call to your mother.  She had stepped out but I have some news for her.
I'll need something personal of theirs.
Claim...? ... Oh, claim, that's what Thomas asked me.
Yes, I will.
How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
That is so true. You're different, Chauncey... Quite different than most men.
I know, Robert... But, strangely enough, I don't feel too bad about now... I feel all right... I guess it's easier... knowing Chauncey is here... to take care of things...
Stay here? Is that necessary?
Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.
Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations.  Good night.
Fine, it will save a lot of unnecessary fuss and it will be so much more pleasant for you...  David, we'll just go on home. Jeffrey, would you call and let them know?
No. I'm a gardener.
Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?
No. It won't do that.
... Mentor...?
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
Yes. That could be true.
He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while.
... Is that all you want...?  ... To watch me...?
... But I've never done...  ... You mean...? When... When... When I do it? ... When I touch myself...?
No. I'm not busy.
Then, I'll be brief. I covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and yourself.
Do you like it?
Really? Really!!!
I see.
Yes, it is very good!
... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
What'd I tell you? Kid-lawyers! The S.E.C.! Damn them!
Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey? Well, I can understand that. When a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time. Just give it some thought, work with the idea, I'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days.
Yes.
Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
I never needed money.
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
No. I'm not badly injured. But my leg is very sore.
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
... I see.
Yes. It is.
Yes. That is surprising.
Fine, then let's get started. The current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and I would like to know if you agree with the President's view of the economy?
Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
Yes, Thomas - I understand.
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
I live here.
Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952.
Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
No, Thomas. I have never been in an automobile.
Do you need a secretary?
I'll see you after the doctor has a look at your leg, Mr. Gardiner.
Hmmm... Take this down.  I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes."'
Very good, Your Excellency.
And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
No problem, Chief.
Right, Chief.
I would appreciate that.
It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific!
Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.
This is my fiancee Maxine.
I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
... and I want to show off his skills by performing a one-puppet extravaganza in Reno.
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.
We have to make it an early night.
Sorry, I'm so late. Lester just wouldn't let me go. Were supposed to have dinner with him on Friday. I can get us out of it if you want. He's really amazing, this insane old lech. It's actually sort of amusing when you get past just how disgusting it is.
The iguana.
All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little.  I'll be in soon. A little while.
Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now.
This is absurd. Besides Feldman's an allergist. If you're going to do something, do it right.
What?
I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.
Yes.
We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
Me and John.
Ah, but you're forgetting one thing, Lambchop.
I'm in love. For the first time. It's funny, but when it happens to you, there's no question.
People make mistakes.
I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.
Pardon?
Yes?
Music to my ears! Whatever you said. Speak, speak, speak, my magnificent friend, speak!
No.
I'll keep that in mind, sir.
No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.
I see. Are you unhappy at our little company?
No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and...
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
Dont let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.
No.
He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
Good. We'll sell tickets.
Tickets to Malkovich?
So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.
It's an interesting story, Wendy. Many years ago in the late 1800's, James Mertin, an Irish ship captain looking to invest in the future of our great country, came to this town and decided to erect an office building.
Ha ha ha!
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
Why are you being like this?
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
Fine woman, Floris. I don't know how she puts up with this damn speech impediment of mine.
Do you?
I'm sure you're not going crazy.
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.
Good. I think its time to beckon Mr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us out of this pickle.
Oh, be still my heart.
No you mustn't, my child.
You bastard!
Yes, Hi.
I've never been looked at like this by a woman.
I have to see you.
Did you see the reviews?
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night."
Lotte called me.
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
It's okay, my sweet.
I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today.
Busy day, my little fire chief. Why don't you climb into bed, and I'll meet you there in just...
Here, let me carry that.
Say the Word!
You getting into bed to think about yellow?
No, Stamp. I ain't.
You saying nothing counts?
Not like He punished me.
Aw, Baby.
No. I'm looking for what I was put here to look for: the back door.
and she is mine...
You best leave that quilt alone. That was grandma's quilt.
That's not true. I told you, I had to get you out, make you safe...so's you and me could be together on the other side, forever..
They treating you right over at the Bodwins?
No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.
She gone like they say?
I don't. I have my own.
You grown.
Yes ma'am.
I never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me. Always. Never be another like her.
In case the house burn down or bad weather slops the roads so bad I can't get here on time or late guests needed cleaning up after. Anything.  Don't ask me what whitefolks need at night.
What you want there? Somebody invite you in?
You sure?
Might see anything at all at 124.
Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few days he been there.
Girl, give it up! We been friends too long to act like this.
Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or what she is.
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
Never found out.
I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for my brother Paul F. Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years. But then they hung my other brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't surprised when I found out they tracked down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. A breeder.
She was only-
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
I'm tired, Paul. So tired. I have to rest a while.
Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at all.
Why me, man?
Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive.
She's not my special lady, she's my fucking lady friend.  I'm just helping her conceive, man!
Hey, man, I'm not--
Who're you working for?  Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?
The?  Who the fff--
Zere ARE no ROOLZ!
Fuck you.
Yes, so we were informed.  However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle.
I am the Walrus.
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
This Saturday.  Quintana and--
Saturday!  Well they'll have to reschedule.
What's that, Walter?
Uh-huh.
We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
Yes, uh, very impressive.
Please!  Please!
--smoking thai-stick, breaking into the ROTC--
--and bowling.  I'll tell you the truth, Brandt, I don't remember most of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!
Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my papers.  Business papers.
And what do you do, sir?
I'm unemployed.
Far from it.
Yeah man.
Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you.  You will receive no bill.  He's a good man, and thorough.
No it's fine, really, uh--
And please don't call her my mother.
But your father--he runs stuff, he--
Exactly.  What happened to your face? Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?
This was a valued, uh.
You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
You mean--beyond pacifism?
Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!
Yeah.
It's all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin said, look for the person who will benefit.  And you will, uh, you know, you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying to say--
Have it your way.  The point is--
My dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude. The whites.
Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight. The ringer can't look empty.
We're screwed now!  We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!
Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!
No, Walter!  I said I thought she kidnapped herself!  You're the one who's so fucking certain--
Walter--
It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking know it's been stolen!
Thanks Walter.
Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me a very secure feeling.
Now Dude--
This whole fucking thing--I  could be sitting here with just pee-stains on my rug.
No, I'm--
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
Uh-huh.
Not exactly a lightweight.
Is this your homework, Larry?
THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, just call Donny then, and ask him to--
Okay, but how does all this add up to an emergency?
What the fuck are you talking about?
You know this!
He can't walk, Walter!
AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK!
No Dude.
You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
But I do work, so if you don't mind--
You're missing the point.  Their vampire victims don't die.  They turn.  They become carriers.  If the Reapers continue unchecked, there could be thousands of them before the month is over.  Do the math.
No.  They've been training to hunt you.
What the hell are you doing, Blade?
If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
Nomak's different.  He's the carrier.  There's something driving him beyond the Thirst.  Something we're missing.
You don't have to hunt to do it.
It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
Why?
Well it's in mine, too.  I'm a pureblood.  I wasn't turned.  I was born this way.  Just like you.  Am I evil because I want to survive?  What about a wolf?  What about any predator?
We'll split into three units.  First team that makes contact wins the prize. Try to maintain radio silence from here on out.
Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
From his father, of course.
You experimented on your own, son?
No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
You little shit.  When did they get to you?
Are we bringing home strays now?
You should've killed her, then.
Just do it, old man.
Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back.
Frost!!!
But I just got here --
I'm sorry, I --
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
For some. Live forever, never get old. The ultimate high.
There are worse things than vampires out there.
If you're not human, then why do you bleed like us? I've seen vampire blood, you don't have it running through your veins.
Cancer.
What are you talking about?
What about the chemistry panel?
Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac.
Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
You.
My name is Abraham Whistler.  This is Blade. As for our little homunculus here --
Some of the old wives' tales are true -- they're severely allergic to silver, various types of wood. Feed them garlic and they'll go into anaphylactic shock --
I'll take my chances.
Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.
Try, please, Anna--
My eye, is there something in my eye?
--my God, Nick???
I just wanna go <u>home</u>.
--he's not my husband!
Down or off--you're giving me a migraine.
Domini. Domini Von Teer.
What?
--whatever; that's her.
It was <u>free</u>--I recall that was the chief selling point for you.
You don't want it though.
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
You want me to scooch over next to you?
--bullshit!
No.
Just...try and go back to sleep.
The clothes--take 'em off-- I want to see every square inch--
--hours before--
Yeah.
It's my fucking <u>job</u>, man!!
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
Yeah?
Still don't see it--
The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
I am.
It's a <u>serious</u> sociological study.
First enormous brick warehouse on your right.
All I need--
A Cyber Entrepreneurialship.
I can't!
Guy who killed all the kids in the '40s.
Why?
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
There is something <u>there</u>--don't ask, just trust me.
Still working on it.
That's why she kills children.
I think you closed the bar again. I'll have to go out.
Yeah, I know. It's...alright. We're all a little--
He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
--it's urgent!
Your mother's pastor.
Yeah.
Where... where you going?
Yeah.
Yeah.
What the hell happened, Ray?
...What was that?
Thanks.
What night is it?
Listen, I ain't a marriage counselor. I don't know what goes on, I don't wanna know... But I like you. I always liked you...
It's, uh... it's in reference to that gentleman and my wife. The more I think about it the more irritated I get.
I didn't say that.  Well?
Ya catch any fish?
Ya catch any fish?
So it would seem.
Right.
Right.
Where?  ...I'm very careful about that.
Yeah, well, I may be getting in over my head here, I mean you're the geologist, but my theory for what it's worth, you got all these volcanoes and each time one pops it's the equivalent of what, twenty, thirty megatons of TNT?  Enough to light Las Vegas for how long?  How many years? Course, I'm no mathematician but--
Tuesday is ladies' night.
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. goddam!!! This is the suavest guy I know. look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. this beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. it makes me puke.
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Okay. I gotta tell you. I've. discovered some things. .Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
Who knows you have these?
Oh my God. Is her son OK?
Hey. Tits. I'm taking your neighbor to the country. maybe something for you too.
Frank?
Those are my breasts.
Yeah. but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Oh yeah, that's good.
Jeffrey.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
Yes.
No.
Don't say that.
There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it.
I sure don't hate you.
That's good.
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything. anything.
Frank would open you.
Does that scare you?
What if Frank came over here and found us?
I'm glad you do.
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. there is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. in every hole. It's opening me to a death.
Dorothy. no!
Who, Dorothy?
A ride?. Hell, that's a good idea. okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
Yes.
I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!
There ya go.
Good, let's drink up.
Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
Yes.
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
Yeah. Good bye.
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Yeah. let's get outta here. What happened?
I'll drink to that.
O.K.
. I wish you wouldn't do this.  It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay?
. OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. this is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.?
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
I'm really sorry.
Nothing really, but it's interesting. they know each other. they seem to like each other.
Jeffrey!!
You like mysteries that much?
Frank!!
For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
Jeffrey. honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do. it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.
You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. real good.
Yeah. okay.
On the plane.
He what?
Yeah.  I am.
Are you kidding?
We'll take it.
Relax, baby.  We're going to wind up like us.
What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not a chance.  So, what's the verdict?
Two years.  George, I can't wait that long.
What?  You're not going to wait for me?
Yes, I am.
Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the United States Government in connection with your testimony in this case?
Padrino will pay ten-thousand per kilo. For everyone.  For you, and you, and you.
We want some grass.
You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred pounds a week.
Barbara and me.  No one else.
Oh hey, one more thing?
I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.
Twenty-six months?  For murder?  I must be your lawyer.
Because they caught me?
I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive.
I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and fifty.  How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?
I just got released five minutes ago.
George, are we gonna do this or not?
Touche.
Try the back bedroom.
George, we've got sixty-one million dollars.  It's either here or someplace else.  We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it.
Que es lo que quieren de me, hijueputas campesinos?
I'm just happy that George has found someone he cares for.
Look at this credenza.  If you don't mind me asking, how much is something like that?  It's got to cost a fortune.
Un sapo?
With all respect, Padrino.  Diego is my partner.  I do not do business without him.
I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up!
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
Of course, George.  We are beautiful. We are brothers.  Real brothers.  Not like Diego.  We started this, George.
No, Dad.  I don't want to...I mean, I just don't want...
I'm going to California.
Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
Let me tell you something, son.  You would have been great at anything.
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?
That was a beautiful message.
Did you know I died two weeks after you sent me that tape?
My problem?  We're broke, that's my fucking problem.  And you're a fucking spy.
I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony.
What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
That's right.  Three o'clock.  Thursday. At your mother's.  You and me.  It's a date.
I don't believe you.
I swear.  On my life.
Swear on my life.
I swear on your life.
I love you.  I love you so much.  You've got to know that.  You've got to know.
Okay, George.
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing?
Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.
Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
That was it.  Seeing Dulli after fourteen years sealed the deal for me. The rest was just details.  My end was roughly five-hundred thousand.  Kristina and I could have a good life for five hundred grand.  Start over somewhere. One final score.  That's all I needed.
You know, he's got a point.  We're fucking Americans.  We stick out like sore thumbs.
The strike is a success; but ...
The successes obtained are the results of those methods. One presupposes the other and vice versa.
The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ...
And those who explode bombs in public places, do they perhaps respect the law? When you asked that question to Ben M'Hidi, remember what he said? No, gentlemen, believe me, it is a vicious circle. And we could discuss the problem for hours without reaching any conclusions. Because the problem does not lie here. The problem is: the NLF wants us to leave Algeria and we want to remain. Now, it seems to me that, despite varying shades of opinion, you all agree that we must remain. When the rebellion first began, there were not even shades of opinion. All the newspapers, even the left-wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed. And we were sent here for this very reason. And we are neither madmen nor sadists, gentlemen. Those who call us fascists today, forget the contribution that many of us made to the Resistance. Those who call us Nazis, do not know that among us there are survivors of Dachau and Buchenwald. We are soldiers and our only duty is to win. Therefore, to be precise, I would now like to ask you a question: Should France remain in Algeria? If you answer "yes," then you must accept all the necessary consequences.
Second name.
What "group"?
The NLF has condemned you to death.
You've got to change occupations, Hacene. Right away!
I don't even know your name yet ...
No, it's better if he doesn't. The house is filled with new people.
Please, we just want to take a short ride. A friend of mine has never seen the Casbah.
We don't trust you, colonel. Come forward, show yourself.
You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie.
I'm trying.
You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
Cause?
Very poor.  He was suffering from severe arterial disease.
What induced it?
Yes.
Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
No -- never.
Marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will.  That's motive. She admits to being there the night of his death.  That's opportunity -- and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle.
Why would she want that?
Aren't they all?
I was just about to make my point, Your Honor.
I'm just curious to see if Mr. Troxell reconstructed anything else.
Really?  What does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning?
The State's investigation just uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday afternoon in Chicago.
No.
Tell the court about that, please.
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
Yeah.
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
Why do you think she left you?
I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson?
Well -- I realized that she wasn't interested in me.  She was just trying to get information out of me.
What did she say?
You called him?
No.
She suffers from severe menstrual cramps.
A previous witness stated that she saw Miss Lawson pouring a white powder into her hand on October twenty-eighth.  According to your records when did you prescribe the drug?
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
He used to call me -- tell me that I couldn't just walk out on him.  He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable.
He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over.
What about Miss Lawson?
He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him.  That his heart couldn't take it.
You're lying.  Marsh was wearing a cast on the tape.  It was right before he went to Chicago and met Miss Lawson.  He dumped you for her, didn't he?
Money isn't the only reason people commit murder, Miss Braslow.
She talked him into it.  She wanted everything.
Yes.
Dristan nasal spray.
Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
Then you would have gotten your money?
Yes.
Frank -- what are you doing here?
No further questions.
I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
Andrew hardly needed leading.  He was a very passionate man.  He was eager to explore.  I gave him what he wanted.  We fulfilled each others needs.
I am who I am.  I can't deny it, anymore than you can deny who you are.  I like sex different -- I like it wild.  That's not a crime.  I loved Andrew.  We made love together.  We made it differently, but we still made love.  It was our way.  It was private -- and now the whole world wants to look in through the pretense of justice.  If I was some middle-aged divorcee who screwed him once a week do you think this would be happening to me?
As it pertains to you -- not me.  Did you always know you had different... tastes?
Yes.
We started talking.  In fact, we talked until four in the morning.  We discovered we shared a lot of the same interests.  After that we were together all the time until he left. He used to call me every night after he came back.  Then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him. I've never left.
Is it against the law?
No -- it just doesn't look right.
No -- not at the office.  I've got a better idea.
It won't be that hard.
You take a lot for granted.
You can see me now.
No -- I'm a survivor.
How's it supposed to work Rebecca? You and Paley celebrate your victory. You get me over here and provoke a fight so he has to rush in and save you -- but then he's given himself away as your accomplice -- now he has to kill me.  After that I figure she'll tell the Police that you broke in.  That you were crazed because we humiliated you in court?
I'm supposed to be on vacation.
Is Mom yelling at you too?
I gotta go.  I'll call you later.
Maybe you don't know what it's like where Mrs. Crawford comes from -- but I do.  I came from a neighborhood just like hers.  This is a whole other world for her.  She's a poor working woman who has been thrust into a room full of highly educated and mostly unsympathetic people.  So, she puts on her best dress, fixes her hair and tries to present herself as intelligently as possible.  Being poor and having pride is not a crime, Mr. Dulaney -- and before you attempt to impeach another witness' testimony in my courtroom -- your foundations better be based on something other than semantics.
Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on to another line of questioning.
Mr. Roston?
You better.  Please answer the question.
Why don't you talk to him now?
We can't pretend this isn't happening.
It's more involved than that.
It was a place to start.
Not even if they're a dork?
It had to get there somehow.
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that.
I said NO!
Well, I don't care if it's legal or not, we're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we can't even go visit her because she's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray.
Sshhh. "After going through the safety deposit box, I'm sure you'll find you're way to this letter. It's hard to write this to my own children. I could let this die with the rest of me, I suppose.  But as one gets older, one fears subside. What becomes more and more important is to be known -- known for all that you were during this brief stay. Row said it seems to me to leave this earth without hose you love the most ever really knowing who you were. It's easy for a mother to love her children no matter what -- it's something that just happens. I don't know if it's as simple for children. You're all so busy being angry at us for raising you wrong. But I thought it was important to give you that chance. To give you the opportunity to love me for all that I was..."
Have you called Betty?  Maybe you should.
Oh, yes.
She changed.
Oh.
How long you been married?
Francesca.
Sure.
I thought it was funny.
A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.
And clean.
Is the dizziness gone?
I feel so embarrassed.
Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what I can tell, I got here just in time. Any later and you'd have made the front page, running down Main Street naked, smoking Camels out of your butt.
Well, let's just call it a compliment and move on.  Did you love teaching?
Francesca?
Are you all right?
Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.
But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
I told you, I love other people.
No, I'm just saying --
... I feel like something's been spoiled now.
I uh... I had lunch in town today. Happened to cross paths with "that Redfield woman." I apologize. I thought you were half-joking about that.
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
Would you like a beer for your bath?
Nobody's asking you to.
What were your parents like?
Yes, thanks.
Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
Well, these... women friends of yours... all over the world. How does it work? Do you see some of them again? Do you forget others? Do you write them now and then? How do you manage it?
What do you want me to say?
I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.
What about us? What about me?
I want to keep it forever. I want to love you the way I do now the rest of my life. Don't you understand -- we'll lose it if we leave. I can't make an entire life disappear to start a new one. All I can do is try to hold onto to both. Help me. Help me not lose loving you.
I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
I said to him Cary you're being ridiculous. You're more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
What about your husband?
Well you should all go to bed early. I'll do the cleaning up.
I don't remember!
Yes, they are.
Cremated?!
What the hell you talking about?
I believe in you guys.  You are the real shit.  And you know it.  Now I'm putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too.  Now all I"m asking is that everybody do their part.  We'll move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here --
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
Yeah, but I ain't talking horse.  I'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more.
I said, no thanks.
Go on.  It won't kill you.
Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.
I've got what I want.  Turn around baby, look at me.  Look at your man.
Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.
Time like this, is that what you really want to know?  How I got the fuck in here?
You mean as opposed to your life?
If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.
My God.  My dress.  We have to find it. And burn it.  And shut the door.
Why?
Yeah.  But when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. The fabric tears.
If I did, I wouldn't come within fifty yards of your door.
Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
Dad?
You cut him, or I shoot you.  Make your choice.
No time for eightball.  I got your tip.
You was just doing your job.
Maybe there's a pipe underneath the floor.  It leaked and stained.
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
You're pretty black to be growing up in Rossmore Park.
How could that be?  The box was packed!
Somehow I don't think he stabbed himself in the chest, then buried himself too.
I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
Where is it?
Where's what?
That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
You're right.  You don't have to tell me, if you don't want to.  I just hope you understand you're among good people here.
What?  Oh, come on, I didn't use one of the good towels.
I told them to run it through the cycles.  But I guess Gino has plans for it because he's coming here tomorrow night to pick this shit up.
What are you talking about?
No!  They're still on their way.
I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes.
So what?!  So fucking what?  Use your head, Violet.  The money is gone.  Gino is coming here to get it.  You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  Is that what you think? I don't.  You know what I think?  I think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in the brain.  That's what I think!
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
The money?  The money's gone.
Caesar ...
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
They're just cops.  Stall them as long as you can.
I don't know.  it could be anywhere. We don't even know if he was alone. Please, Caesar, we don't have much time.  Let's get out of here.
Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
They were in a car accident.
I should be going.
Another time.
When I reach ten, then I'll start with you.
Why?
I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
...  thank you.
Oh, I'm sorry --
I don't, really.  I was referred to him.
My pleasure.
Yeah, come on in.
No.
I have a tattoo, would you like to see it?
No.
How long have you been with him?
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.
How can you sit in that bed and say that?
What was it then?
You mean Shelly?
What?
That's his brother.
Yeah, twice.
Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  He gets right to the point.  Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
Trust me, Violet.
Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do.  I'm getting nervous, really nervous.
...  Me neither.
Jesus Christ, Pop.  You got two hours until your plane leaves.
Yes.
We're exploring <u>every</u> possibility.  We are in pursuit.  How much more do you want me to tell you?
Yes.
Why?
That's all I get?
You call about Monsieur Kane?  John Michael Kane?
You are a friend of his?
Yes.
...I understand...
Who?  Who came?
I need a ride out of here.
It's a little late for that.
I've got a situation here and --
Get me out of here.  <u>Please</u>.
You have blood on your pants.
I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
What if I say no?
Then I'll find another ride.
I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?
I don't know.
When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
I don't know.
I don't remember any of this.
Thanks for the ride.
How could I forget about you?  You're the only person I know.
...omigod, no...
-- where does this come from? --  How do you have my picture?
-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>.
-- we'll tell them what happened --
Who paid the bill?
I don't know. 
<u>So what are we doing</u>?
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
-- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
That'll solve all our problems.
-- he's running from the cops, he's got a bag filled with God knows what, he's in the building and I don't know where! --
You're American.  I thought so. From your teeth -- the dental work --
Mumble ... Tuttle ...
Well not exactly. But, if you help us we'll help you. The Forces Of Darkness have won the day ... but, tomorrow is another one
He will be pleased when he comes home.
In fact, killing people -
Well ... well, I ...
What? - Oh, yes - vividly. I used to wonder if they were real.
OK. Come back this afternoon, about four o'clock. If you give me the number of the case, I'll have the dossier here waiting.  My tailor,... well worth the investment.
How do you mean?
Not much.
No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for.
{baffled) I don't follow you.
Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
So what are you going to do about her?
What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury.
Of course. We went to school together. You're my oldest friend.
Say it was a mistake.
What?
You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
Stamped?
No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
Information Adjustments.
Us. Them. I don't know ... just get going.
I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams!
Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you.
It's my fucking life.
Why?
Where are you taking me?
It does doesn't it?
What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties.
What parcel?
A heavy Christmas present.
Really.
No. Please. They're going to arrest you.
Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop! 
"And your children all gone."
It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have 31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle.
Oh, good!
I've never seen a Ministry cheque before.
We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
Here we are. Pink and blue receipts. All you've got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque.
All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified.
I never signed the form.
Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next door, ha ha!  My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome to Expediting.
This is your dream girl, is it?
What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
Is Mr Helpmann here?
Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
What? Now? It's my lunch hour.
Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...
It's too exciting. I've left Dr Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.
Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer
Hello. Mr Lowry?
Who's that? 
I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
No. Wait here.
On the house. You did me a favor. Check the corridor.
I don't think a week's gonna do it.
Pregnant.
No, no, that's impossible.
Are you pregnant? Estas embarazada?
She's having a baby. Twins.
Es impossible.
No underwear?
Mary said you might be coming.
What about Kanita?
You're going to three-four Avenue C, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information.
What's his name?
John, play the Sinatra.
Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
You sure? I know my father would hate to be tied down. He wouldn't even go to the dentist.
Look, I'm sorry, but it's important to me. I mean, a week ago I was wishing he was dead. And now I want hear his voice again, just once more-- you know what I mean?
Not as good as Nino's.
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
No, I'll be fine. I'm just visiting a sick friend.
Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?
Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
The ghosts--
Thanks.
It's coming.
Here's to the greatest job in the world.
Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.
Ten-four. El Toro de Oro. Blast off.
Let me think.
Okay, whatta I do?
You learn that in the army?
Do it!
Frank!
What?
Sure, I'm taking the captain's exam next year. After the kids are in school, Louise can go back to the post office and, I thought, what the hell, I'll start my own medic service. Out on the Island the volunteers are becoming salaried municipal. It's just a matter of time and who you know. Someday it's going to be Chief Larry calling the shots.
We sure do.  I don't mean it as a knock either.  Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think and you can disregard it if you want.
The pointers were great.  I'll study the tape.
Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late.  Sorry.
London.
No, I liked the way it made me sound. Okay.  Be good.  So long.
Now listen, Arnold just said that he's been making three million a movie now.  But he's not ever gonna change.  He's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie.  He feels no different.  He also bought a brand- new condo with Maria, they gonna furnish tastefully.
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
You're welcome.  Sow how does it feel to...I know you gotta go -- Me too.  We're very busy here.
They're not that dumb, after all.
Yes.
No.
I lost six pounds...
Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too -- he couldn't help.  My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland.  The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks.  Personally, I think he should aim higher.
Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...
Ernie told this story.  How he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices, he cried.  He was till that way when they promoted him out of obits.  He says you're lucky if you can get out while you could still cry.  I should have quit this place  three years ago.
Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
I'm going to take it.
Well, we met about three months ago. He works at the surgeon general office. He loves boating.  So, he's been getting me into water skiing.
I'm gonna go look at it again.
We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased.  All right?
I understand.  I'll go with you.
How long has it been since you've been home.
You can make it a little less brutal by knocking a million dollars or so off your salary.
And Bobbie says...
Bad manners.
Yes.  That's right.
Yes.  How do you know?
My roommate's very social -- somebody from Justice was over and...I always hear things before they happen.  Hey, and from now on, so do you.
Oh, please.  So they were really impressed with you at work.
I wish it were you giving the story.
No.  I'm doing fine...Look.
Finish quickly.  I don't want you getting obsessive about these things.  Good night.
Okay, that's your opinion.  I don't agree.
No, I really got this job on a fluke and wait till you hear where it ends up.
I don't write.
Hey?
And it has nothing to do with the fact I left your room instead of staying there?
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
What do you mean clean?
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
Excited.
Yeah?
Hey, I know how to have a burger by myself.  I feel like a little solitude.
I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.
Too many smart people in one room -- it's not healthy...
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
It's not important.
What pills did you take?  You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.
Why, you need me for the story?
Uh-uh.
Where are you?
Uh-huh.
He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
This is a one-way argument.  We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger deal.  I go to London right after that. So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here.  The plane's boarding.  You're good at deadline.  Here's your ticket.
What I don't know, I can learn and what I know, nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself, but I think it's true.  What do you think?  Never mind what you think.
Okay...It's so good to see you.
God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind? Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him.  I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?
I can't be.
Right back to you.
It would never occur to me to worry at all about you.
Don't be silly.  What are you sorry about?
I decided to make a female figure after all!  I want you to pose for it.
Shh!
Honest?
It's a...full length life-size figure!
Ready?  We've got plenty of time.
Hm...
I thought you did on account of you kissed me the other night!
Is it?  I've forgotten.
Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...
I'm totally serious!
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
Oh come on!  Even you can see its value.
Yeah then you could unload - sell this stuff for a lot more.
I don't know it was made out of driftwood and dipped in sulfuric acid.  It was out there...
Let's check out the scene.
Well I was uh, just looking...
Well it sure looks dead enough.
Well I don't know -
A parakeet?
You want me to open a window or something?
Yeah, why?
Excuse me I have to make a call...
Uh, sure.
You're coming downtown with me, Walter.  You're gonna come clean with me, you're gonna name names or I swear to God I'll see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate! Are we understanding each other?
I ain't going no place with you!
Call me...Maxwell.
I thought you didn't respect money!
Hello Walter.  I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
If you see him.
My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
Stay away from my thang.  Sorry, honey.  'Thing.'
Suck!
I'm hungry.
You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?
Maybe.
Hi.
I do?  I guess I do.
No, you didn't.  When?
It was.  I think it's pretty much ready for the --
Not exactly.
They were vampires, weren't they?
Well, stay here tonight.
I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
Merrick...
It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand.
Pretty shallow of you.
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. You should have been taught, prepared.
I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
Let me get this straight.  You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.
Did you ever dream that you were someone else?
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
Here?
Oh.  Good.
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
A what?
Another distraction.  It's not right.
I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
All right.
What's happening?  What do you want?
Got that.
I heard she got straight A's.
Probably was.  What do you suppose she was doing out there.
Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
You want some punch?
Oh, please.
Right!
Except for Prom.
Right.
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
No...  You want me to give him a message?
You should think about leaving, too, man.  Sell this place... Something's going on here.  I don't know.  Something real weird.
I am.
Honey, don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love. They'll say the strangest things.
Would you rather me be making love to him, using your name, or making love to you, using his name?
Which nostril am I breathing through?
It's all the same thing.
Nuke?!
No.
Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty?
He did?
I'll be back when we lose.
I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me.  I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit...I mean I'm getting it--
I won't be needing these anymore.
We all deserve to wear white.
Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not "dim".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
Who?
Why not?
Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were?
Not yet.  It takes years of practice...
You'd be great, just great...  'Cause you understand non-linear thinking even though it seems like baseball is a linear game 'cause of the lines and the box scores an'  all--but the fact is that there's a spacious-"non-time kind of time" to it...
Three-fourteen?  Hmmm...  Look't those thighs, Jackson
Never heard of 'em.
Chicken bone cross take the curse off this bat and bring me hits.
Yes.  A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.
You missed the tag!
You're close, Crash, you want me to run you?  I'll run you!
Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that?  Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh.
Shake off the pitch.  Throw what you wanta.
But he ain't seen my heat--
Awright, meat, give him your heat.
You're the boss.
It's time you started working on your interviews.
You outta your mind?  If you give in now you might start losing.  Never fuck with a winning streak.
Then go.
You fuck!
Okay, I'll kick your ass there.
Forget it.
No.
No.  Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
The Crash Davis. ) And you, Larry Hockett, should recognize me 'cause five years ago in the Texas League when you were pitching for El Paso and I was hitting cleanup for Shreveport, you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game in bottom of the 8th and I tattooed it over the Goodyear Tire sign, beat you 4-3-- and I got a free wheel alignment from Goodyear.
And where can I go?
It's a damn easy thing to play with.
Better find our bonus baby, eh?
C'mon big 'un, you're okay...
--we had the gun on him tonight-- the last five pitches he threw were faster than the first five. 96 miles an hour, 98, 97, 97. 97.   He's got the best young arm I've seen in 30 years.
Eight and twenty-four!  How'd we ever win 8 games?
It's a miracle.
It's a damn convention.
Looking for Crash Davis.
...he did what he was told.
It's like everything else in this place. You don't do it yourself, it never gets done.
Now, instead of the cops only lookin' at Nicky, they started looking at Green too. And he was supposed to be our squeaky...
That's right.
Liar.
Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out?  And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license.
You got it.
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake?
Yeah, yeah. I know that.
Sam, I - I don't know where she is, okay?
I'll call you right back.
You got it.  Schmuck.  All right. I just bought us a few minutes. Want to get back at this prick?
They payin'?
Listen...
Hey.
Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
What?
Hey, Rich.
Here, let's put a little of this on for you. I know you like this. A little butter, right, not a lot?
What're you doin'? He's a square guy, for chrissakes.  You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the FBI.
Fuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you?  All of a sudden, you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time.
I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head?
You should say so.
I'll be honest with you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.
Listen, I would -
It's none of my business?
I see you, you motherfuckers.
...hundred yards further down the road.
Oh, I don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin' casino because I made that possible!
What are you -
Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
Back - Back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you?! When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?! Get this through your head, you -
Yeah.
Yeah, she's with that cocksucker again... and they got Amy.
Well...
How do you do?
Oh, thank you, sir.
You bet.
Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?
Okay. You come by the house?
I'll come by.
Half - I'm comin' down. 
...trying to offer you the respect that your...
That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris.
Yeah, Bill, listen, I'll explain to you later. Just - You - You got a gun at home? Yeah. Bring it over here right away.
I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
Understand?  I'm sorry.
Yeah.
It's nice isn't it?
All this stuff doesn't mean anything. Money, this, doesn't mean anything without trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life.
Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
But as much as they loved her...
Why do you need that much?
Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.
Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff.
We had a deal. Remember that?  He said if it didn't work out between us, that I could get my things and I could leave.
Listen...
...the rest of the two million is still there?
Okay, no big deal. That's okay. Yeah. He got his twenty-five.  That I'll live with. Any more I couldn't.
Yeah.
You hate my guts? I want you to come with me now.
Get out of here!
Oh...
So what? So who fuckin' blew you in the parking lot before you came in... huh?
Just wait there for me!
Oh, you are...
If she calms down...
Good evening, everyone, I'm Paige Novodor.  What should have been a routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, Sam
Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, maybe more.
Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you.
Get out of here.
What expenses?
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving you fifty thousand cash.
She's on the account. There's nothing we can do.
Bullshit, you're out of here, cowboy!
I did - I didn't -
Well, listen, uh... Good luck with the joint, huh? 
What?
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -
But I'm just trying to leave.
How are you?
I'll take care of it, Remo.
It's in all the papers.
What could I say? I knew if I gave the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've would up gettin' killed.
Hm.
I understand.
Fine.
Oh, come on.
You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
Yeah, right. That's Sammy. And he's probably got it there too.
Yeah.  Boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he?
Yes, you are.
Yeah.
Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it.
How the fuck am I gonna get your fuckin' money now? You think he's gonna give you fuckin' money? Are you out of your mind?!  Look what you just did to this fuckin' guy! If you would have just kept your fuckin' mouth shut!  Ah, what the fuck is the use? I should've never got invol-
You fucked with me for the last time!
Right.
Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?
You're driving me nuts!
Listen...
There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more.
Oh, there aren't?  What's that?  Huh? What's that.  There's no more. Thanks, hon.
Why?
Come here, come here.
Get up.
Every night, on the couch.
Yeah?
Remo.
It's up to you.
You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at.
Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
And you make it disappear, you know what I mean?
Shh.  Hide her car in the back!
Fuck you, you motherfuck!
Kill you,  You motherfucker you!  Frankie, do him a fuckin' favor.
You sure?
Yeah.
Maybe if I stick your fuckin' face through this window over here like, you know, you'll - you'll get unconfused. Give me the fuckin' money!
All right, take it easy now, take it easy.
I can't take this no more. Back and forth, back and forth.
Uh, I have a plane to catch to Cleveland...  Can I get my winnings?
I don't know. I can't remember.
I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff."
There's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion, if..
Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
"Well done," Cactus.
I know how you feel, humiliated in the hands of a woman. I'd rather eat my soul on a paper plate...
A bit sadistic, don't you think, Captain...?
Just a homeless woman. Wrong place.
Oh, I like her. I like her a lot. I want to save this one for later. Something that tasty you don't eat all at once. Go back to your alter- egos, we'll regroup in the morning.
And...your point?
It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say "I'm wearing no underwear"--it'll be funny..  You do know you're evil, don't you?
You're not strong. You're scared..scared that someone like me will see right through you. Whatever the Cult of Good was, it's not anymore... You don't have to listen to me, just listen to you..
The Mission is happening tonight..It's up to you to...to save the City...
Hello, Rachel. I'm Selina.
Yeah, as in born before..Ooh, I suppose it's "sexual harassment" to give a woman a compliment. Sheesh. Come on, gentleman...
What if I were to say "You're Fired?"
Uh. "Thanks?"
But of course you are.
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
Oh, I forgot to tell you, you're on a diet...The fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you.
What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"
Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..
I don't see anybody in there but you.
Don't you have children?
Matter of fact I did have a kid once.  But he's a lot better off with his father in Milwaukee.
He ran out on me to be with you? Well fuck him!  Everything worked twice as good without him.  We didn't need him then and I don't need him now.
Oh.  Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
I am not!  Fuck you!  Theo's a genius.
You could've made me lose my call.
I'm not staying in here with him puking all over the place.  Get this door open!
And stop with the directions.
Make a "U" and go back.
It's rolled up in the tube on the floor back there.
Allow me.
Because you know you'll be killing us.
Then hang up!  Do it!
They tortured my husband.  Made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts.  Once they get what's in the safe deposit box they'll kill us.
Rachel!  They're going after Rachel now -- and I can't stop them.
Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.
What are you doing now?
They say she resembles me -- dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. They all wear the same uniform.  Please.  Be careful.  The man driving the car must have a gun.
How much time do you have left on it?
I've lost you.  You're gone.  I can't hear anything.
I'm trying to.
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
What do you mean?
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
How come everybody turns out to be a crook?
Yeah, sure that's me.  Ask anybody.
You can't give up.
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
I can't do it.
Yes.
Why can't it be her?
We've almost got your husband and your daughter out.  So don't get any ideas.
They tortured us.  And you're going to let them have all that money?
At least one.
Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
Shit.  You couldn't be in much worse shape.
He seems to be headed for Topanga.
What's that supposed to me?
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
Let me talk to him.  Hold the phone to my ear -- but don't nudge me.
Fine.  I want half.  Plus the release of the family.
Whatever you say.
You got time on your side.  Pretty soon they'll be missed and we'll have the law up our ass.
308-9962.
We're waiting for the light to cross the highway.  It just changed.  We're in a grey van.  It reads "<u>Noble Carpet Cleaners</u>."
I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio.
Negative.
She's yours.  What are we waiting on?
Next I want to see Rachel.  Put her on the phone before she gets out so her mother can tell her exactly what to do.  Keep her calm.  Tell her you're fine and that she can join you in this car.
Then you can sue the cops. Collect from both ends.  Tighten your belts.  Here it comes.  Ready?
What does it take to kill you?
Five minutes.
Where do I turn?
None of your business, but it's in the cab.  That's all mine.  When we take from them, we divide, eighty-twenty.
In your dreams.
Tell the truth, I was going to take a much needed leak.
From here on, I dish it out.
He's what she should run a mile from.
He gave me a look.
Nice.
Maybe he wants something.
Jimmy.
Fuck off back to Essex!
Fucking mad!
Not me.
Where?
Like what?
Did you do that to him?
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
Don't call me that.
When?
I'm working on it.
Don't be cruel.
He'd bring me carnations.
Don't.
You following me?
She's the thing you had to tell me.
You got the keys to the shop?
No.
You promise?
I promise.
No. Want to make you into something new. That nobody recognizes...
Prescription. For my condition.
Only in times of extreme stress.
I got the order to shoot him. Before I could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and died.
Died...
In a manner of speaking.
It was you...
Try and go, then.
Never.
It's my name, Dil --
Tell me what she wore.
Not if you go.
Stop it, Dil --
Fergus.
Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
You're back in the pink, Tommy? How're you keeping?
Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.
I know.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche. You know we won't leave her out of this. But I'm glad to see you care.
And what happens then?
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
So?
Aye, I do, Peter.
Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we would call a legitimate target.
Right.
I can smell her perfume.
What?
It was a job. So I get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face.
"Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No use telling them I came from Tottenham.
And you play cricket?.
How different?
Yeah?
Thanks. I know that wasn't easy for you.
That you guys shouldn't be here.
What?
Yeah?
What does that mean?
What you say, faster?
No, fuck the bear. The name. Jude. And it's June. Jude in June.
You know what I mean -- the envelope with the stamps. I want it.
What are you talking about?
First her husband, now her -- she hoodwinked you! She batted all them big eyes and you went 'n fell for it - like a egg from a tall chicken! Here!  You want? Here -- it's yours!
That's right.
It's lovely.
That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
But Charles' appointment was last week, not --
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
Yes -- and tell me if you recognize anyone. Just a moment. Have a good look.
Then whose is it? His or theirs?
And I'm afraid we want it back.
That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it.
Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
Like I said, Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger. Remember what happened to Charles.
Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?
Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really.
No.
Gratine, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
No, Mrs. Lampert.
Herman Scobie. And you've never seen him before, either?
You can't prove it, can you? You're still trying to --  marriage license! Did you say -- ?
You'll wreck your raincoat.
We wait -- with our mouths shut.
I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?
Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
It's all right with us --
I thought that was Peter Joshua.
Why not a lying Blackfoot?
Which one are you?
So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
I'm not fifteen.
Why can't you be serious?
Cutting it out.
I think I love you, Alex --
I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.
Maybe.
Or Tex?
No, about Scobie, I mean. I can't think of any reason why he was killed.
Yes, I know.
First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
How often do you go through this little ritual?
Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around -- I want you to believe that.
Are you trying to say that I might have killed Charles and Scobie?
The man's the same, even if the name isn't.
Yes.
Not unless we're blind.
Leave me alone -- !
I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of the Police Judiciaire. Would you be so kind as to come with me, please?
I don't know.
Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
We took the liberty of calling your dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we would learn something.
One more question. Is this your husband's passport?
I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Flix lives?
He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild.  We don't know each other, do we?
I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
How do you know?
Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.
Instant divorce you mean?
You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
I don't think I follow you.
Who said?
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
I believe what he said.
Don't put yourself out.
Come on now -- sure you do. An' you'd better give it to me, Miz Lampert -- cuz I ain't foolin'. No sireebob!
Va jouer, mon ange.
He's the only husband I've got. I tried to make it work, I really have -- but --
The American Embassy.
Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him!
Me too. I'm going to start telling people that I saw her drop to her knees and latch on to his unit vector.
ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?
WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
is there anything you do?
You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
Daddy you scared me!
Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
What's wrong?
Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
She said she was Kenny's aunt Lisa.
It can't be.
There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
Should we close down any eruption?
Two kids were found mutilated in the woods. Lock the door after me.
I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here.
No.
Yes that's the whole point. This is what I was put on this earth to do. Rape the town that raped my mother. Steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers. I've planned this since I was a very little boy. You have no real freedom either. Your father has cast a shadow that you've never eluded.
That was before he pulled this 'Dick me or I dump you' shit. I say fuck his best friend.
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.
Why?
Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.
No I'm really grounded. When I got in late the other night, my father was waiting up for me.
I'm not using him as an excuse.
That's not why we broke up.
I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.
Have you ever heard of someone named Lisa Sherman?
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
Not that I know of.
The library. I'll be fine.
And the police did nothing?
Yes. He asked me to come over and talk to you.
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
But you don't really mean it.
Yes. Unfair to me.
...shit.
Andy.  Another fuckin'...
...off.  Say, uh, three seventy-five. Seein' that we both have so much love...
No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait.
Yeah, I believe him.  He was my friend.
Then you drive me to McGrud-...
That dog was mean before I met him.
I'm gonna stomp your a--
Shut...
Fine. 
God-...
Okay, okay! 

Don't gimme that "nice job" shit, man! They still got a vanload comin', and what do you got besides an empty...

...I'm not the psycho.
You wanna hit me?
...let live.
...up!
...Shift.
Come on, old Pete.
Come on!
I know the likeli-...

All right.

...here!
What?
This river's fed by a glacier.  Willing to bet my life that it's a good deal under fifty degrees.
Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You...
So I took his truck, yeah.
 Yeah.
...Long.  Somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis...

A-And you  owe me...
Are you all right?
Huh?


Arlo!  Arlo.
 I'm sorry.  I'm a little 

Okay.  Okay.
...our ass!
Tunnel.
You've gotta be...
Forty-nine point four.
What?
It's melting, man.
 There's gotta be...
We're the shit.  Bigtime.
Who drove the ice cream...
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
Us.  Owes us.
I think so too.
What about all that "no need to get in the man's...
Yeah.
I was undercover as a tennis player.
...about him.
This country trained me to kill...
I did what I could for you...
 ...have it.  You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
No!
You'll kill us all!
Damn you, Long!  My people are out there! Your people are out there!
...not at all like a man responsible for the deaths of eighteen peo-...
...me?  Well, you could've saved yourself the trip.
...that.
...and the government.
Forget about him.
...Destry, Fair Oaks....
And I'm warning you, Leo.  Don't test me. Get your men and your machines off my radar screen in five, or three million people will die.
INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - DAY.

Uh, you wanna hunt outta season, it's cool with me.  But mostly, well, they just take a six...

Cold?  Cold.  How cold?
And what if it does?
Well,  Costello's finished with the stability profile, but Abbott is still chewing on the load file.
I got eight thousand yards. Radius is five...
What?
If it was Wednesday night, I was workin'.
You find yourself wearing a...
That's not the way I...
...public drunkenness....
What happened to Colonel Brynner?

The Army, sealin' us in.
I'll lead 'em out.
 
INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK/BOX - DAY.

'Course you do, Jake.
So anyway, he says, 'whyn't you do what the Chinese do?'
Tell me. What do the police say?
Who's the investigating officer?
Was he right?
If Mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him.
Yeah. Do you remember the last time you talked to Mulwray?
Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
Avocado groves?
Hollie was always fond of tide-pools. You know what he used to say about them?
There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting.
Have you got your checkbook handy, Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.
Just bring your checkbook.
What's that, Curly?
Not for your wife. That's the unwritten law.
Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
Curly, where's your car?
Could you drive me somewhere?
You sure this is okay?
How'd you get past the guards?
Looking for someone.
Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered.
Tell us about it on the way to Pedro.
Give you three minutes.
Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
Iced tea.
It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
My husband.
Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me.
No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
Yes. He never forgave him for it.
Before this I turned on the faucet, it came out hot and cold, I didn't think there was a thing to it.
What dam?
The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
Yeah. They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid.
So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
The Albacore Club.
It has to do with my father.
Mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing. He wanted to know where she was.
Give me an example.
The police?
She's not tied up!
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
...That's not what I meant.
Upstairs. Why?
I want to see her.
You know any good criminal lawyers?
Who is she? And don't give me that crap about it being your sister. You don't have a sister.
To Mexico...
Where can we go?
On his day off. Get the exact address.
Okay...
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
Get me the Times. Whitey Mehrholtz.  And how about that snotty broad?  What does she think, she's perfect? Coming in waving her lawyers and her money at me  so goddam smug. She's no better than anybody else in this town.
Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.
I think I got something.
There's just one question.
Don't be sorry, neither does Dad. Wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey?
I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
We understand, c'mon, sweetheart.
Help yourself.
Hope so. He's working for us.
Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
I don't understand.
Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation.  I don't know what you're talking about.
I said, the northwest valley.
Yeah.
Mr. Gittes...
Now, Mrs. Mulwray, what seems to be the problem?
I'm afraid so.
...Yes of course.
I'm sure he loves you, too. You know the expression, let sleeping dogs lie? You're better off not knowing.
But I have to know.
Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.
May I ask what this is regarding?
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.
Apple core?
Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives.
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
Cross was looking for her all over the country. Offered rewards, everything. Felt real sorry for him, with all his money.
Of course I knew your father. He was tall, thin, pleasant, and had a moustache like mine. Always smiling. He looked like Clark Gable.
It tastes wonderful!
Heeey! Totooooo! Don't get pissed off with me now! Come here! I don't know where the fuck I have to go.  And the next time be careful how you talk. Not to take credit away from the Lord, but if I had created the world, in all modesty, certain things would have come out better. But unfortunately such was not the case.
You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.
Could be...But I don't like this business. It smells fishy to me.
Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh? 
Elena. My name's Elena.
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
Politics. He's the district representative. We met at the University in Pisa.
Then where's the money?
What does it say there?
I didn't see that.
All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case.
Ready for dinner, Brad?
You know how long it took the "Chronicle" to get that staff together?  Twenty years.
We certainly do.  Vacation's over - starting right after dinner.  But right now - that lady over there -  - that's the new society editor, I take it?  You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?
That's a long story.
And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in?
Enthusiastic?
Well, well - isn't that nice?
Not some girl he knew casually and then remembered after fifty years, on his death bed -
Just old age.  It's the only disease, Mr. Thompson, you don't look forward to being cured of.  You ought to see Mr. Leland.  There's a whole lot of things he could tell you - if he wanted to.
Who said anything about brooms?
You've got a private office here, haven't you?
Because we're running a newspaper, Mr. Kane, not a scandal sheet.
No, Mr. Kane.
Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
Of course.
Emily -
Oh, they'll publish it all right. But that's not going to stop me -
Rogers, I don't think I will postpone doing something about you until I'm elected.  To start with, I'll break your neck.
Charlie, please don't -
In the water.
Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you?  I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that -
And I know too many people.  Obviously, we're both lonely.  Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
Oh, me -
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
Can't we go back, Charlie?
I'm not going to have my guests insulted, just because you think -  - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic, that's their business.  You've got no right -
You're my wife, Susan, and -
Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you.  What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at?  It's only money.  It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.
Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!
Love!  You don't love anybody!  Me or anybody else!  You want to be loved - that's all you want!  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  Whatever you want - just name it and it's yours! Only love me!  Don't expect me to love you -
No, you're not.
- And left?  Of course they'll hear.  I'm not saying goodbye - except to you - but I never imagined that people wouldn't know.
You can't stop me.
Thanks.
"Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast."  You know you haven't the slightest proof that this - this armada - is off the Jersey Coast.
I think we'll have to send our friend Wheeler a cable, Mr. Bernstein.  Of course, we'll have to make it shorter than his, because he's working on an expense account and we're not.  Let me see -  Mike!
Marie has been packing since morning, Mr. Kane.
Yes, sir -
No, I don't, Mr. Kane.
You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
It doesn't make any difference about me, but one of these days you're going to find out that all this charm of yours won't be enough -
Sure I am.  She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes.  I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -
Rogers isn't even pretending.  He isn't just scared anymore.  He's sick.  Frank Norris told me last night he hasn't known Rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years.
I can remember everything.  That's my curse, young man.  It's the greatest curse that's ever been inflicted on the human race.  Memory -  I was his oldest friend.  As far as I was concerned, he behaved like swine.  Maybe I wasnt' his friend.  If I wasn't, he never had one.  Maybe I was what nowadays you call a stooge -
Sure, Mr. Leland.  I'll be glad to.
I wonder how they put all those pieces together?
Yes, sir.
Hold this thing up for a week.  Two weeks if you have to...
Nothing is ever better than finding out what makes people tick.  Go after the people that knew Kane well.  That manager of his - the little guy, Bernstein, those two wives, all the people who knew him, had worked for him, who loved him, who hated his guts -  I don't mean go through the City Directory, of course -
The banks are out of luck, eh?
Oh, I don't know.  They'll clear all right.
Think again!
I had a toothache.
It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
It's cheaper than cigarettes. And it certainly beats this.
No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!
Like I'm responsible for all the smokers!
You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
She said not to come home until graduation.
Train. It took eight hours.
Very dramatic, I thought.
I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby.
No, you're not really getting married?
Was I right?
But you were.
Stop it. He's a nice guy.
I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years.
But can we date?
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words.
Was it you?
Well, I don't know if sorry can make up for it. I found your remarks highly offensive.
Well, he missed!
Hey, neither did ET; but that was a great movie, right?
Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
Why?
You win.
I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
Seven months.
Eight and a half?
In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
I think it's safe to say yes.
It would stand to reason, yes.
I think they were Catholics.
Compliments of Lando Calrissian.
She's in here?
Perfect dozen.
You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?
What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them.
The best Burtless movie ever made.
He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
See? There you go again.
I just want to play hockey like I was scheduled to.
Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.
Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four.
I can't close the store.
Thanks for putting me in a tough spot. You're a good friend.
Bible truth.
Reach what?
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
May I be blunt with you?
I know I'm your hero.
Five hundred dollars.
Holy shit. That girl?
Now I know you're lying.
I'm not. She just left.
Bunch of savages in this town.  Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.
Why do I have this life?
You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.
It's not like I'm miles away.
No fat, but no tone either. You don't get enough exercise.
Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
No, she's getting married.
I'm not dealing.
Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid.  E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs.
A half hour.
How do you figure... HEY! You can't roll a joint in here!
It's not my store.
A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
So why do you sell it for so much more? I'll tell you why-because people come here and they're like "A dollar eighty for soda? I should get it at Food City. But I don't feel like driving there. I'll just buy it here so I don't have to drive up there." That's exploiting a weakness, too, isn't it?
We were going to start again, I think.
Veronica.
Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
I don't know. She was senile and shit. Used to piss herself all the time. C'mon Silent Bob.
Such a wiseass. But go ahead. Crack wise. That's why you're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day's work.  I got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch.  You make sure this gets back. The number's eight-twelve-Wynarski. And I wanted to get a damn movie, too.
Why did you agree to come in then?
I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.
Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?
Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
How do you figure?
It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
We might have; I don't remember. How many?
You've slept with twelve different girls?
You're a pig.
John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
They put up the least amount of struggle.
Why do you say that?
Dante...
Um. Thirty-seven.
Really?  You're the best.
What did he say?
The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
Sure.
It was only a few times...
And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I've gone down on a couple guys!
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
The due date is on the bottom. This summons cannot be contested in any court of law. Failure to remit before the due date will result in a charge of criminal negligence, and a warrant will be issued for your arrest. Have a nice day.
Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.
Check this out, he's from Russia.
He is.
Feel that.
I have first dibs.
C'mon, man--it's perfect weather for a monster, full-fledged gutrush!
What?
More bang for the buck.
I don't know.
What usually eats a banana?
I want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy?
The clip's not gonna hold!
Sarah, hold on, he'll have you in a second.  Jesus Christ, grab her!
There wasn't time for anything else.
We'll never know, will we?
My pleasure.
Fine, I guess...
Sarah, we could take off and leave this guy behind...
Just keep lookin' at me and only think about the distance <u>across</u>. Count it as you go:  One, two...by eight you'll be there.
Can I count as fast as I like?
Sure you can.
Help me!  I don't want to die!
When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.
After the funeral I just had to leave.
Did I miss something?
Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
Resuscitation?
--mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe...
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
Where?
I only came back for you.
You know me, I'm a night person.
It was great.
Want me to lead?
What?
Don't let me fall!
Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
Take the rope.
Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
Now you get burned.
Ryan, get a rope, I want the man on a leash, too.
I'm touched.  Kristel, check the chopper, let's go.
Qualen, go fuck yourself.  The game's over--you lost.
There.  You blind?
Hold on, baby, he'll get you.
Who the hell ever is.  This is the most protected shipment we've got-- and the most useless. These bills aren't even <u>in</u> circulation; the one thousand dollar bills we're transporting are only used for international banking exchange.
On my way.  The cases are hooked up and ready.
Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
The monitor! I never ask twice.
Down there you buy a life, up here you earn it or die.  How's your health?
Then go fetch.
Primed to go off right over his head, officer.
Pardon me. Luce. He raises glass to breast, pulls red handle between her legs. Milk spurts into glass. Dim joins the others. Alex looks at a party of tourists.
Then, by God, you have been sent here by providence. Tortured in prison, then thrown out to be tortured by the Police. My heart goes out to you, poor, poor boy. Oh, you are not the first to come here in distress. The Police are fond of bringing their victims to the outskirts of this village. But it is providential that you, who are also another kind of victim, should come here. But you're cold and shivering. Julian, draw a bath for this young man.
My wife... Alex freezes.
... used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing.
Hullo.
I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
You've not been to school all week, son.
Hullo love, how are you?  Nice to see you, Dad.
What gets into you all? We study the problem. We've been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. You've got a good home here, good loving parents, you've got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?
Not true, sir. It was only a slight tolchock. She was breathing, I swear it.
I beg your pardon?
Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much down in spirits.
It's this Health Farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up with like gold and silver and like jewels.
We always help our friends, don't we?  It is no secret that the Government has lost a lot of popularity because of you, my boy. There are some that think that at the next election we shall be out. The press has chosen to take a very unfavourable view of what we tried to do.
Thank you, Fred. Thank you. Minister turns and signals. Door opens and a crowd of cameramen and reporters rush in. Aides push two 6-foot loudspeakers and a Hi-Fi on a trolley.
Aye, that's Joe. He... ummmm, lives here now. The lodger. That's what he is... he... he rents your room. Alex confronts Joe.
Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy.
There, there mother, it's alright. He doesn't mean it. You were in the papers again, son. It said they had done great wrong to you. It said how the Government drove you to try and do yourself in... and when you think about it, son... maybe it was our fault too in a way... your home's your home when it's all said and done, son. Em sobs.
... and that... He pulls Alex's ear, pushes him off balance and plants his foot on his chest.
Then your toes belong on the other side of it!!!
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
Pick that up and put it down properly. Alex does so, and continues to empty his pockets.
Now then, were you in Police custody this morning?
Do you mean Church of England?
No, sir.
I'm your Psychiatrist.
Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
Right... Knickers... Cabbages... It doesn't have a beak. Alex laughs. Slide of woman speaking to boy.
Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.
Fucking hell...
I hope so. Is that the end then?
Yes.
That!... Using Ludwig van like that! He did no harm to anyone. Beethoven just wrote music.
You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform.
No Father. It's nothing like that, Father. It's about this new thing they're all talking about. About this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again.
Amen. They cross themselves.
Leave to carry on, sir, please?
Carry on, Chief.
Something to sharpen us up, you especially. We have the start.
Thank you.
First Friday of the month?  Linens. Roll right off the trucks.  They're in and out in twenty minutes...  ...which means they left fifteen minutes ago.  Traffic will be smooth.
No.  You were right, I was wrong...  ...Max.
There were two of us.  I had the other guy killed.  Don't need the competition...
<u>Kill</u> you!  He's coming to kill you!
Comin' over Coldwater.  Goddamn deer jumps out in front of me.  You believe that?
Jesus...
The crowd was most kind.  I was born in 1945, but my life began the night of July 22, 1964.  That was the moment of my conception.  Right here in this very room.
Then let's have it.
Wouldn't dream of it.
So?
Oh, right.  The guy flipped out or something?  Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?
They found him dead in his own cab down by the Port Authority.
So?  It was a random thing.
Elvis?
Jesus.  Two in one night?
And you came all the way down here to see me?
Of course!
I'm standing right here.
Who the hell is this?
Hang on.  Carefully...
...I'm sorry, I don't see it that way...
You prefer nights?
None taken.  There are talkers and doers.  I like doers.
No shit.  Since he has two .45s double- tapped through the sternum and fell six floors onto his head...
You're cool.
The trunk?
Yes.
I didn't throw him, he fell.
What do you care?  Ever hear of Rwanda?
Then don't let me get cornered, Max. You don't have the trunk space.
Good luck.  You think they got families?
It was an accident.  I'm not liable.
Next time you pull any shit, I'm gonna kick your fat ass.
Yeah.
Collateral damage.
I don't understand...
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
I'm not catching a melody.
That's the point.  You play <u>between</u> the notes, you dance <u>around</u> the structure, you improvise.  Some people know where they're going to be ten years from now.  Same job, same neighbors, same shit over and over.  That's not living.  That's dying a little every day.  Not me, pal.  It's not knowing what's around the corner that makes like worth living.  That's jazz.  That guy up there, he knows what I'm talking about.  Hell, it's the same thing <u>he's</u> talking about, if you just open your ears.  You can hear it in the conversation he's having with that trumpet...
You mind?  I'm working here.
I'm done.  Find another cab.
There's no way I'm taking you to see my mother!
Jazz.
Maybe so.  Maybe she hears what you tell her.
What do <u>you</u> call it?  Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.
I told you I don't like to talk about it.
Why?
The man who hired me for this contract.
I shoulda saved him 'cause he <u>believed</u> you?
Some living.
The guy came right at us!
Sure.  And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone.  Nearly snapped me in half.
You think I'm crazy.
I think you're different.
Johnny Dancer.  You've been in my office ten times.  How come you never asked me about that picture before?
That's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out.  A lot of people are after you, Jerry.
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
Them who?
Oh, well, maybe to the untrained eye.  Hmm... Ahh...  Ooooo...
I have no idea.
I'm not sure.  I think I figured something out.  It must've been in my newsletter.
Never heard of him.
You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
Just a guy trying to put out a fire.
I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?
I put an ad on a computer bulletin board.  I log on at the library so I can't be traced.
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
Henry Finch.  That they monitor everything.  That it was only a matter of time.  And now four people are dead.
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
Murdered?
Right here in Manhattan.
Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.
It's Geronimo.  Love. It lets you see things.  It gives you insight. I've loved you since the first time I saw you.
Connecticut.
Did you kill him?
That's the last time you rode, isn't it?  Do you think it was your fault?  Is that why?
Love at first sight?
Why not?
Without a love of my own.
I like that.  A gun to your head and you ask about your partner. He's okay.  May have a headache for a few days.  Are you here with honorable intentions?
You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
You're here because you figured I might show up.
That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
Only on the football field.
Brain washing, mind control, that sort of thing?
A vulgar pop term, but yes.  Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin.  That was our goal.
As in 'resulting in death.'  We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate.  Why is that?
Wait --
You don't understand --
I don't know.  Didn't see him.
No idea.  Honest.  What are you going to do?
Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
I disagree.
Oh?  How's he doing?
Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
You can't just pull the plug, David.
With me.
Are you threatening me?
We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
You were right, Ellie.  You were right all along.
It'll just take a moment.
Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
It's incredibly rich.  We've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages'; right now we're on 10,413.
I don't have an official response, Michael.  All I have are the same questions you have.
And current theory holds that to sustain the sort of wormholes you're talking about, even for a fraction of a second, would require more energy than our sun produces in a year, is that correct?
Try again between the static and 'Hey Jude'; that's where they're hiding.
On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers.
Okay, okay... there.
Can you help us?
But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.
But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat.  I understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it?  The 'primer' that will make decryption possible...  I've found it.
What are you talking about?  It's over.
Oh, not quite yet.  At least for their sake...  ... I hope it's not.  Because they're running out of time.
It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made.  I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist...
Ellie... even if you do manage to raise the money, have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this?  I mean a college fetish is one thing, but we're talking about your career. You won't be publishing.  You won't be taken seriously... and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all.
It's almost there.  The hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time.
Thirty-one linked dishes.  You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.
Peter -- if you can get him to do that for me he'd obviously do the same for you -- we could -- !
Ellie --
I'm -- I'm fine.
And mind, yes.  What are you --
Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
Can you try?
Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent.  But this experience went beyond both.  For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with.
Yes.  Very much.
Why?
It's too... elegant.  The degree of economy is extraordinary; it's really the next logical step... Even on Earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature. D.N.A. outclasses any computer we can come up with; the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable.
Losing Faith:  The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy.
Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
I don't follow.
It's late.  We should go back.
I remember.  You were indelicate, indiscreet and entirely less than tactful... Sound like anyone you know?
What is it?
It's not enough, don't you understand?  I know it happened -- but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point.  It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real.
Y'know what?  Fine.  I guess if we want them to know the truth about who we are there's no quicker way to show them.
I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --
But --
You never thought that's a heavy load?
Tried to live always just as free and aboveboard as you been, and well, they ain't that much elbow room.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
I'll give you fifty cents.
I got eyes, don't I? How my not gonna see something like that?
What happened? How far did you get?
A cold drink? Okay?
A Lucas Jackson.
Back at it in the mornin'. Just need a little nap...
'Atsa sign I got me an affectionate nature.
Foolin', Hell! I would have eaten that dirt for them. They coulda used my head for a shovel and a my face for a broom... They just never did get a piece of my mind.
But what am I gonna do all by myself?  Oh if'n I hadn't lost mah head. I only had two more years to go. But when I saw you tearin' down with that truck... But you right Luke. We oughta split up. Be safer for us both.
You ever eat fifty eggs?
No more than five. For a cold drink.
Cuter.
Hell, no. I ain't goin' down in the ditch.
This is a big day for the guards. They get to remind us who's boss.
He doesn't know when to give in. They'll kill him.
No. No chains either.
You ain't man enough to wear them!
You phony creep!
Fear of what...
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
No, dear.  You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.
I want to die.
I wouldn't.  He'll be back.  If you want him.  The cute brutal type with handcuffs.  Very sexy.
I'm the only friend you've got, darling, and I don't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us.
What pattern was that?
The same as the first time...
No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.
You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago.  You read it yet.
<u>You</u> thought I was going to do Ted Bundy next, so you sent your partner...
I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...
Inspector Halloran, Homicide.  I'm in charge here.
For months... last October.
He felt remorse.  He covered her.
Nothing.
Look at the bottom of the screen. You see the icon with the arrow pointing left?  Click on that... twice.
Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
He's going home.  He slept over because I was a little anxious...
But it's a different m.o.
Have you got a warrant?  Get the hell out o here!  This is the <u>only space I have left in the</u> <u>world</u>!  Why can't you leave me out of it?
That little Winona Ryder manner... you're more convincing as Clint Eastwood.
Please thank Inspector Goetz for taking care of me last night.
That's exactly... I could have taken that same picture, this morning.
They're not talking to me.  Saks looks right through me.  I ask him for some bodies, for the phones -- he's so encouraging: "you make that <u>your</u> little job."  Condescending bastard.  Helen, on your lists to call is San Quentin.  Daryll Lee Cullum?
Ruben's dead.   So stupid, a cop thing, a crazy kid and a buncha dumb mistakes... I'm sorry... because you and he...
You're exhausted.  Let me get you a brandy.
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
MaryJane.  We call her M.J.
She on the passenger side?
Why don't you shoot off the lock?
I'm over here?  What's your name, Officer?
Yeah.  And you used that. Used <u>me</u>
Yeah, you did that too.  You earned what you got; don't shit on it, that's all I'm saying.
God, you're cute when you're mad.
Who gives a fuck?  In all the years I never seen you cry.  You loved him.
Don't ever forget how good you are.
Why would he send this to Helen Hudson...
Look at her legs.
Excuse me?  <u>Excuse me</u>?!  What do you...
It's against your rules that I try to help a witness who's scared shitless?  Who's...
Am I in charge of this thing?  Or not.
Just, I need results.  And -- I am short-handed.  Who else am I gonna give him?
I gotta have Ruben, and a...
Give me Ruben back...
No, she can come in tomorrow... gonna want to know a lot of things...
Then you shoulda known she wasn't buying.  She was just long-term leasing' you.  Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare twenty-second twitch, there ain't nothin' about sex I don't hate. But of course, I'm Irish.  Plus I got <u>real</u> problems.  I'm worried I might have to put you in over M.J.  There's something going on here, the Commissioner is targeting her now, I can't leave a woman in that position.  But the thing is, how can I move <u>you</u> in, if you go on acting like a teenage asshole?
You should have gone to the funeral.
I wish I had. They bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months.
What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet?
No, I couldn't. I feel too close to her.
I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant.
I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.
No.
It's something we're all intimately involved in: The reshaping of the human body by modern technology.
Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
Have you been in contact with the principal about your job?
Then, you should call.
I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too.  A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they'll be ours.
What about the engagement party?
Really?
What about the souffle?    Has that gone in?
We all agree with the doctor, Dear. He thinks it's safer for you to stay here for a while.
Paul said he'd call the school.  And your father thinks he's convinced the guard not to press charges as long as you get help.
As soon as Dr. Emlee says.
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
Mom, please.
And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke.
It's good exercise, Mom.
Lie?
To talk?  Well, OK, that might be good.
What about patterns? Do you find yourself checking and re-checking locks? Or washing your hands over and over again?
Wow.    I'm bad news.
What's my rap?
Schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid delusions.
No way.
That's where I always go when I get out.
And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
Do you?
Really?
Out? Are you kidding?     I've got all the fixings here.
It's sex time.
It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
I couldn't even face that one.
Bingo.
I didn't talk to her about medications, Michael. Don't be silly.
Silly, silly, silly.
I guess so.
Well then why'd it happen?
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
I know I don't want to lose you.     I don't think I could stand it.
Can you loan me a 20?
I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
Of course. Yes. I will.     I do.
I need to tell you something, and I'm not sure how.
Who?
It doesn't matter who.
I start on Monday.
I think I've heard this speech before.
Or, of course, you could take a sabbatical the rest of the year.
Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
When this is over you can say whatever the hell you want. I'll be long gone. Besides, who's going to believe you? You're just a two-bit crook.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
Oui.
Oui.
Oui.
-- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
When you return please extend my regards to Mr. Maranzano and his family.
Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.
I'm not here to negotiate.
You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
He missed three weeks.
But you were there?
You have enough to worry about, Angelo. You don't need my problems.
What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?
Thank you.
I'm trying.    It doesn't work.
I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go. He's telling you you're going! And if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go!
I think if he told me he was going to steal Van Gogh's "Sunflowers in a vase" I would remember it.
This ain't about that and you know it. This is about you never forgiving me for leaving the crew.
What is that a threat? Are you fuckin' threatening me, Marcel?
That's Frankie Zammito.   The Under boss of the Chicago Mafia.
I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi told him to.
Has to be.
Get out of the room! You've got company coming up. I'll meet you at the Chevy.
Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
Man, I can get anything.
Fine.
I'll tell you when it's time.
Okay boss.   Where are they?
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
That's brilliant! Care to elaborate?
Hey, you know you can't this in France.
No.
The hell it is.
You see that car?
Watch this.
J&amp;B?
How are we supposed to sleep with this noise?
The lucky ones.
Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.
You gonna forget about the money I owe you?
How's the arm?  Still sore?
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
So what if I don't?
He is my defeated foe!
I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you want to change into them?
It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
Yes.  Did you know I was once engaged to be married?
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
Don't distance us.  From now on, let's be like sisters.
I'll give them to you.
Come and get it if you can.
All right.  If you can take back the sword in three moves, I'll go with you.
If you don't, I'll come after you. And I won't let you off so easy.
Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me.
Too many men have died at its edge. It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade.
It's time for me to leave it behind.
It was Bo, Sir Te's man.  I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.
Then, why did you come?
But it's not your sword anymore. You gave it to Sir Te.
True.  But I must borrow it for one last mission.  Jade Fox must die at its edge.  Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone.  I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.
You did your job well.  But, this girl... I saw her last night.
All right.  I'll write you an introduction.  Take it to Wudan. Wait there for news from me.
Your hand, rough and callused from machete practice... All this time, I've never had the courage to touch it.
We must avenge mother!
Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying.  Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.
Then someone's trying to set him up. We should inform Li Mu Bai.
You buying?
No further.  I'm serious.
The venom of bad memories.  You were there; you saw her.  I saw you seeing her.
Leave here.  Don't do this.  I don't want you here.
He was a present.  Besides, we're moving anyway.  You said.
It can't rain all the time.
I dabble.  May I?
No name.  You sure ask a lot of questions.
No.
I think he's yours, now.
You mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave?  Euww.
Victims.  Aren't we all.
You don't even remember...
I took yours from you.  Your little girlfriend?  I took hers, too.  Your meaningless, petty life?  I took it so that tonight your existence might gain a purpose.  You're no avenger. You're mine.
Does it hurt?
Shelly?
You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going.
Very well, it's your ass.
18k.  Crap.
Only thing you'll get from that clown is a faster way to die. LAO To the contrary...
Did you know Sebastian well?
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
Really? I thought he said it all the time.
Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
No. I mean. I don't know.  What else do you know about him?
Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded.
I must say I found it rather appalling.
What'cha reading?
Is that the last thing you need? My your clever.
Thank you.
Why not?
Because you act like a pig.
What's the big deal? We're friends. Haven't you ever seen your friends naked before?
You don't even know me.
You truly want to do something to make me happy?
What?
If that's a problem, then I'll make arrangements to stay with some friends.
Of Human Bondage.
I can't win with you.
I thought you said we were going to be friends.
I have feelings for you.
Yes.
I'm sorry about that.
- wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me.
Greg McConnell.
He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.
Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me.
Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.
Doctor King is my favorite.
Really? Bulimic headcase.
That's great.
You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
Eyes closed.
Why didn't you do something?
I did?
I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.
I don't love him. I love Ronald.
That's one way of looking at it.
But I thought high school is only four years.
I look terrible.
I swear.
I don't want to kiss you here. I want to kiss you there.
Is it me?
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
You told her I never said I love you before?
I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone.
And this happened before you and I hooked up?
I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.
Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way.
I'll think about it...
What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
What's your problem?
I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.
A momentary lapse of judgment, soon to be rectified.
She wouldn't say. She apologized to your aunt and told her she was going to stay with some friends.  You blew it, Sebastian. That girl has come to her senses and she will never go near you again.
Kind of.
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
I'm not in the mood.
It clearly is why.
I have a flair for drama.
You were very much in love with her and you're still in love with her. But it amused me to make you ashamed of it. You gave up on the first person you ever loved because I called you names. Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered that you chose me over her, but please understand, I never loved you, Sebastian. You're just a toy. A little toy I play with. And now you've completely blown it with her. I think that's the saddest thing I've ever heard.  Cheers.
And if I don't?
War it is.
Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
I guess that puts me in my place. Thank you for the hospitality Mrs. Caldwell. It was a true awakening.
Well please leave a message that I called.
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
I did?
Kathryn. Did you hit her?
Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
Did you ever make a wish?
I really don't know, but I do know that you must return the ring. You get Edward to take you up there and bring it back to the old lady.
I got my wish anyway.
Sh! Then you must keep it true. Goodnight, darling.
She was very pretty.
Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
I wonder if you don't resent that in her?
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
That's the Farren house.
But I told her to go with you.
Certain wishes do.
Can't you tell me later?
Why didn't you run after them?
She gave me a ring, so I'm giving her a ring. I paid twenty-five cents for it, too.
This one hasn't got a name on it. Who's this one for, Amy?
Why, daddy, you know my friend too!
She's upstairs.. .the lady who lives up there.
My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
Will you be friend for always?
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
That's right!
This is more fun than just pretend.
But we don't have any sea weed.
Pretend, darling.  It's All Soul's Eve.  Round about the fire we go...  Over the flames we leapt
It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
She's dead! I know what it is now when people say somebody died. I know what they mean! And I'm afraid. She's dead; she's dead!
But why?
It's a pretty ring.
Will you come soon?
It got hit.
Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days  those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
Good.
My little girl said she'd kill you if you came to see me. I can't let you die. We'll have to hide you.
But I am Barbara. I didn't die.
Yes. Yes, Barbara, I shan't forget.

And Amy mailed them?
She needed, a companion, so out of her own hunger she created one. In her mind her friend was in the garden. In her mind her friend never leaves her. Right this very minute I'm sure she's upstairs sobbing out her grief to a friend who exists only in her mind.
Your lips look delicious.
Never felt better.
What does that have to do with me?
It's okay if you are, we just want to know. I don't want to be expecting grandchildren if...
Anything's better than Mark.
Can't you get contacts?
You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.
What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite, the old standby, "I have to use your bathroom."
Are you kidding? He might as well say, "Can I date rape you?"
Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
No. I don't think so.
I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
What? Why the hell did he do that?
He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him!
I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out.
Great. George is meeting Carlton first for drinks. We can meet and go together. It'll be a blast.
Oh my god. I've never had that before. I've had guys say they want me to suck their dicks and gross stuff but no one's ever said "Hey there beautiful."
No you don't, believe me.
It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
I don't know. You have to take Sammy. He's afraid of me.
Shit, I guess I missed work.
Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
Relax. Carlton was torn apart. No way could you have done that. Maybe you saw someone kill him and blocked it out... or...
Yeah, I guess. Mark?
I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!
What choice do we have?
So what do I do?
No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself.
About Mark? Carlton?
Frida? You okay?
God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower.
Starving.
They say sex is great for cramps.
My apartment's just such a mess.
Uh huh. So pee.
You never say that.
Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
This really isn't a good time.
You think that story's gonna make me loan you money?
My bra is my biggest supporter.
Yeah?
A little.
I think we should do something with strong female characters...
No.
Okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call.
I can forgive you a bestseller.
No, she died when I was twelve.
Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
He's bad news. He cheated on me, he insults me. Now suddenly he gets jealous if I have a date.
No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this.
A man killed in Central Park.
Yeah, every guy you date winds up dead.
I loaned him to Jennifer. George moved out and she was lonely...
Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.
What? Is there someone else?
I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
I have the silver bullets in case I need to protect myself. Does that make you feel better?
Oh my god, what happened?
No, take it.
Take some allergy medicine.
Hey, you hear about the chick that came in today? Said some chick bit her at Victoria's Secret. Bitches are outta control these days.
No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her.
And you think I'm sick?
She says she's on the rag every time I get called in to investigate a murder.
Only two bucks.  Shave as well...
What of?
Yeah, Im like that.  Senility says the wife.  But she sure cant complain.  Heh.  The erector set still works good.  And this aint no fucking rug! Ghead.  Feel it!  All mine!
I <u>know</u> it's his doctor...  I need the file on..  Daniel Paul Schreber M.D.
He tried to kill me!
He's seriously disturbed...
That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
I see.  One things for sure, hes ambitious. Youll be a busy man from now on.
<u>Fine</u>?  Look here!
Shut-up.
I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
Shut up, freak!  Monster!  You are insignificant.
No.  I mean...  that isnt necessary.
Well...
I don't blame you for getting angry. You are in a frustrating situation. You must be patient though.  Trust me completely.  I'm here to help.
We are...  living in their dreams...
They're dead, John.
Don't worry.  You won't even see her.
You're kidding?
And we're going away for a holiday.
Right and don't embellish.
I promise.  I won't.
You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
Yeah.
I know.
... What?
The guy's in a coma, Bob.
Soon.
Bob...
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
I just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be.
We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.
Oh, I know, I know... It looks awfully bad.  It's really embarrassing.  But it was Bob's idea.
She knows.
Why?
Certainly.
Oh, come on, we're not children.  I didn't have anything to do with this Fidelity nonsense and you know it.
Yeah... Sometimes they do.
On occasion for security purposes, to double for the President at the Secret Service hires someone public functions and exposed situations.
No.
Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
First thing they teach you at the academy.  `Don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my King.'
No thanks.  It's not that far.
Oh, come on, Bill.  Don't patronize me.   I'm not one of your little...  Turn around.  I'm talking to you!... Turnaround!
I run a temp agency.
Yeah.  And it's better than not believing it Their faces are inches apart.
... Me, too.
... Not exactly the Oval Office.
Oh... I lived with a President.  It isn't any fun.
Then why did you come here?
How did you know we were on this island? Do others know? Will others come?
Let's just....wait a minute. Get a better look.
Listen, Missy. I am the only due process that has ta be served aroun' tyere and one of the people doin' the servin' from now on is gonna be you. Now you been prancin' aroun' the Cave like yer ass was glass fer long enough! All that's
That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.
You disappear in here, darlin'. You get a knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer veins. You get lost out here and nobody's gonna notice. Rhodes, he counts on that. It all makes for food in the freezers.
What?
Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel!
We always planned to use it. We got some ground up already...but we could never find enough.
There's hundreds of 'em. Right where we landed our boat.
The hospital? 
He's my contact for Chrissake! There's two crates. Can you get me into the hospital?
One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.
You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done.
They will never be satisfied with anything else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh. I'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they don't get mine! Not while I'm still using it!
Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat.
I said, I'll take care of them. Just leave them there. Go help with the rest of the gear.
Sir!
Let me see your weapon.
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
Actually I don't
I don't think they're in school.
They're townies?!
Knox Overstreet.
But why?
Needs Chris!  Must have Chris!
Yeah.
Well hell no, Charlie, but that's not the point.  That's not the point at all!
It's every bit as hard as they say. Unless you're a genius like Meeks.
He flatters me so I'll help him with Latin.
How about a trig study group?  Right after dinner.
Ahh!  Eat it, Dalton!
This is it.
Don't you think they'll figure out who did it?!  Don't you know they'll come to you and demand to know what the Dead Poets Society is?   Charlie, you had no right to do something like that!
But I thought-
I'm sorry.  I, we
I think you're sweet.
I'm not?
That's not my fault.
You're welcome to join us, Todd.
All right.  I'll second that.
I'm supposed to turn everybody in, apologize to the school and all will be forgiven.
Stop what?
Ridgeway High.  How's Henley Hall, Gin?
You are?  She's glad I called!
Chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet.  But you can bring someone if you like.
Huh?
And if it so happens that you're wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you?
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
Then come with me.
Dead Poets honor.
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
A barbaric yawp.
YAWP!
A madman.
From the moment we enter crying to the moment we leave dying,  It will cover just your head as you wail and cry and scream!
I don't know.
What I have to do.  Screw the annual.
Nothing.  No mention of it.
I'm sorry, Neil.
Yes sir.  I'm sorry.
Oh, so you're that Anderson.
I don't.
Found what?
So?
Jesus Christ, whose side are you on?  I haven't even gotten the part yet.  Can't I enjoy the idea even for a little while?
No.
Sssh.  That's what I'm taking care of. They need a letter of permission.
I will be with thee straight.
All right, be cool, everybody, nice and slow, no sudden moves.
The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
Shut up!
What are you people talking about?
That's what I do.
Seen a lot of islands?
Yeah you did...
You know what kind of force it took to rip open the bow of this ship? A million little things like this...
...we gotta get outta here -- NOW.
That's it? That's all you give a shit about?
Oh yeah...and that my stich job doesn't make you uglier than you already are...this won't hurt a bit...
No! The man in the moon!! Who's driving this thing?
What? You don't think I can have a normal life?
Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast?
A little to the left...
Joey...
Joey...
You want some too?
Plans don't change...
I'm looking...
Those are mine!
You want 'em?
Hey Geraldine, let's eat!
We're all going.
They did too!
In case???!!! In case of what? In case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall?!
It won't open.
I love this car. Some cars sit, you know? This car, a car like this... grows. I mean you never know, with a car like this, where this car has been.
Nick...
No.
I have to go.
You are his friend.
Everybody love Linda.
That's right. That's exactly what I mean!
You mean...?
You call me Linda, just like home.
Thanks.
Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes says he goes one more... He retired, you know.
Shhh! Albert's gonna hump the Coup de Ville.
Sit down. Here. Right here.  Albert! Vince!
Not so good.
Kind of. You didn't know?
Nick, she won't say why.
You Biederman?
I got you on this flight, Biederman. Is that right?
That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret.
Naw, it's... This guy wants his money.
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
That's wonderful. I think you should... fresh air.
I don't know.
Playing?
Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
Merle, I wanna go home!
Yeah.
Pow.
Promise! You gotta promise!
It's ahead, Vince.
What are you, God?
What do you think?
I did. I... This is stolen. I came back.
John Wayne... Listen, Nick --
Wait a minute. Sal. Hold it. John Wayne's making so much noise I can hardly --
Merle gave me this?
Well... Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird... You want to hear the whole story?
Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.
Mom, I hate to break this to you, but there's a whole other species out there you're neglecting.  If you've forgotten, they're called 'men'.  Sometimes referred to in more colorful language.
We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
Where?
You stole the heroin out of the evidence room and planted it on me.  I was iced.  What better way to keep me from talking.  Stop me if I'm wrong.
Fine.
Shut up!  Drop it.

How do you know?
I'm not fond of television comedies.
Relax, let technology do the work.
GCI.  TM-1.  What language are you talking?
I was set up.
Hey, Rip Van Winkle, maybe we'd better call it a night.
Good night, Wade.
I'm serious, Wade.  This case is important to me.
Lighten up.  You're going to give yourself an ulcer.
How do I look?
Not yet.
Seat's too high.
From over the mountain --
I've brought you something to keep you warm, Mrs. Stone --
No, thank you -- what's your name?
And serve him right!
Why? It don't hurt.
All right, darling.
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
No. She's gone.
She couldn't be gone!
But she is -- I've taken her place. Don't you remember -- you wrote me a letter. Mrs. Stone was too ill.
Belle --
I'd like to know where you'd get it....
Stevens -- what's all this leading up to? You know something. Come on! Out with it -- you know something about me!
You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet -- it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities --
Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right. But--
Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --
About what?
Well -- I'll be -- if it isn't little Mary Sampson from Franklin.
Not long -- now.
How do you do, Belle? How are you, Jabez?  Well -- mighty elegant house you got here.
You mean that's all you had me come out here for?
That's fine. Now you can tell people all about the house, but don't mention Webster.
Shake!
Coming.
Now, Jabez! I've got on my Sunday bonnet and I'm going to church with my husband. Almost the first time since the beginning of winter -- and if that isn't an occasion, I don't know what is.
Mary -- it's gone.
To save us work on the spring plowing?
You always said, the field uphill needs a rest, but if you think --
Mary -- how do you feel?
Mary -- look! Hessian gold. I found it in the barn.
Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
I'd love to.
Looks right elegant, Mary.
Yes, Mary.  It's been a long day.
You'll never change -- will you?
Sorry, Ma -- but this consar-- this little pig --  He won't let me fix him --
That's right, Ma -- we ain't licked yet. A Stone's never licked till he's dead -- that's what Dad used to say, didn't he, Ma?
That's a word you're too free with lately, Jabez, consarn this and consarn that ...
But it's true. Take 'em up in your hands, Mary -- feel 'em -- they're real all right.  Aren't you glad?
Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
What's that you say, Son?
Now that's the way to talk, Son! I know you worked hard for that crop. But we'll make out.
Mary -- Jabez --
What mountain?
You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
Of course not --
Hullooo!
Why, that's different!  Well, boys, I guess we'll knock off. I've got to see a friend.
I'll be there, too!
Pretty good -- that's perfect!
Scratch will do for the evening. May I -- join you?
Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.
And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England? 'Tis true, the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in the country than yours.
Let it be the quick or the dead -- So it is an American judge and an American jury!
The quick or the dead! You have said it.  May -- the best man win, Mr. Webster!
Why don't you?
Married.
The past six months.
Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.
'Cause I'm a New York cop who used to be a New York kid, and I got six months backlog of New York scumbags I'm still trying to put behind bars. I don't just get up and move.
Tell me about it.
Who said we were terrorists?
It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open!
William Clay.  Call me Bill.
That was Gary Cooper, shithead...
When you're hot, you're hot.
Oh?  What idiot put you in charge?
That's okay...  ... I have an eye on his private bathroom.
My job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be.
I'm fine.  You throw quite a party.  I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan.
Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
Stand by, Powell.  I gotta check something out.
I'm serious.  Hey, this is my wife... Holly Gennero.
What's it look like?  We're going in.
Who the hell knows?  Maybe he was a stockbroker who looked at the Dow Jones and opted for early retirement!
Listen.
Fuck you, sir - if I'm right, I don't need you.  What I want is - if I make an honest mistake I want help.
Yeah.
Come on, what's under this?
God damn it, Sheila isn't gonna believe it.  They just call in and say gas up a stretchout and get it down to  and I say, 'shit, another load of Elks for the massage parlors.'
The robbers in the bank.  They got guns?
Yeah.  A lot of guns.
I'm really shakey.
Well, you know ... Moretti told me before that you were drugged up.
Yeah...
Yeah... obviously you don't... when you put a gun to somebody's head... and you say go to sleep so that it won't hurt when I pull the trigger. Death?  Don't talk about death to me.  I have been living with death for the last six months.  Why do you think I'm in the hospital?  I take a handful of pills to get away from you.  And then here I am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone... again.  I have no friends left.  No job.  I can't live.  I have to live with people. This death business... I'm sorry!
You're really crazy.
Why you going to Algeria?
All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
Thank you much... and huh, bon voyage.
Oh no!
I'm afraid.
Sonny-boy, one word?
You frisk me.
Okay, give us the women.
So -- you want me to send one out there ... Okay.  I'll see what I can do.
Calm down, you're not ...
Nothin' doin'.  I give you one hostage when you bring my wife, and one for the helicopter, one for the jet, and the rest can come home on the jet.
You tryin' to fuck me?
No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you.
Don't fuck with me ...
Okay ...
Eugene, at 3:07, this became Federal.  Why don't I take it over now?
I got two kids ... and I'd like to see them again.
You like me?
No you don't.
We like you, too.
Why not?
Yeah?
Yeah.  Well, you're okay?
When was the last time you saw Sal?
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
You don't want cancer?  You're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer.  Gimme the cigarette.
Yes...
But do you mean in? ... But you just told him that if worse comes to worse...
We'd kill ourselves.
Wyoming.
Why couldn't he talk about that here?
Aw, Jesus ... you been doin' us favors all night!
I've got a jet.  I'll have airport limousine here in a half hour.  I want the hostages.
Nothin' personal, huh?  The man that kills me, I want him to do it because he hates my guts.  Not because it's a job.  Okay, let's go ... but you gotta walk in backwards.
Come on, nobody's going to the bathroom - come on...
They're beautiful ...
Don't talk to them anymore.  Sal and me are getting a jet, we're going to Algeria - I'll write you from there.
He was very understanding - you ought to talk to him ... Algeria?
Did Pop come down?
Robbing a bank.
What about, ah, non-union occupations?
Of course not ...
<i>Morning.</i>
<i>I forgot.</i>
Fella takes out two kids and has the audacity to not show up for trial.
What?
What!!?
He sent us out to the Fender Compound. Out in the desert near the Chicken Ranch.
That's the rumor on the street.
That's the only way you can cope with the route your life has taken. The fact that you made the choice to pursue this life- style... much to the chagrin of your mother... who is so clearly ashamed of you.  Imagine her shame when we cart you off to prison because you won't just tell the truth about what really happened. <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- DAY FOR NIGHT [MESCALINE TRIP]
This is your last chance. Tell us everything you know.
I became a bounty hunter because of cunts like you.  I remember all the cunts in high school who were mean to me. Eventually... they all grew up to be just like you. Angry and bitter because they peaked early... and now they're stuck in some dead end marriage... or worse yet... an unfulfilling job that keeps them from meeting a man.
I was a musician.
You're wearing eyeliner. You look like a queen.
Many times.

But real. This is gritty. Like Cassavetes.
I almost had to yoke him this afternoon.  Tell me, tell me, Radio Raheem, to turn my music down. Didn't even say please.  Who the fuck he think he is?  Don Corleone and shit.
He makes all his money off us Black people and I don't see nuthin' but Italians all up in there, Sylvester Stallone and motherfuckers.  Ya see what I'm saying, homeboy?
We shouldn't buy a single slice, spend a single penny in that motherfucker till some people of color are put up in there.
Yes?
Excuse me.  I'm very sorry.
Damn, Sal, put some more cheese on that motherfucker.
Sal, how come you ain't got no brothers up on the wall here?
Ten.
I said my name is Eddie Lovell.
Don't ya love ya brother Mookie anymore?  I loves ya, Jade.
Do me a favor.  Go to work.
I'm working.
I'll see ya there.
No, you're tripping.  Don't come in Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.
I know, Mother Sister, but I'm here now.  Where's the stuff?
Sorry, comb got caught.
I'm not studying no Mayor.  Besides, he reminds me of my least favorite peoples.  My tenants and my ex- husband--Goddamn-bless his soul.
What is?
Do I have to spell it out?
Can't do.
You know you don't get paid till we close tonight.  We're still open.
Tina, what do you want me to do?
Later for you.
Tina, I'll be right back.
Be a man.
Hello, Sal.  Hello, Vito.
Fuck dat shit.  I deliver pizzas. That's what I get paid for.
And not Larry Bird?  Who's your favorite movie star?
Eddie Murphy.
Sounds funny to me.  As much as you say nigger this and nigger that, all your favorite people are "niggers."
He's right.
I understand.
My friends laugh at me all the time, laugh right in my face, tell me go feed the Moulies.
Stop busting my balls.  I said I'm listening ten fucking times already.
I know so.  He, them, they're not to be trusted.
Here, take the broom.  The front needs sweeping.
I'm sick of niggers, it's a bad neighborhood.  I don't like being around them, they're animals.
I'm gonna kill somebody today.
Baby listen, there's nothing more American than not doing anything and getting away with it.
Sleeeeew sheek baw...
You're the kid who was home schooled.
I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
Four colors? Neato!
We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.
Would you like something to drink?
Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?
That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
What? No! Look.
Well la de da.
Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...
No, it's a treasure map.
Why not?
Well, besides cooties and other medical reasons, they're not in the cool crowd. Which I am, and you want to be. Know what I mean?
Shift to your left.
Oh, of course.
You brave soldier.
I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
Yeah, go-cart accident.
Will not.
No.
Okay. Anyone else have any questions?
Welcome to public school, my friend.
Oh! Ho! Okay. You wanna go?
Some what?
What are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
Do you hear something, Captain Rob?
No. What happened?
No. Look.
He must be on his way to pee out a fire.
Well, I'm listening now.
But my mom gave me the map.
It was a diamond and you swallowed it.
That's because Captain Rob is not a pirate. We've been through this.
Well, that's too bad, this is his day.
Hey, where'd you go?
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
I wouldn't know. Being that I'm just the teacher and all.
Don't play with me dear, you're way out of your league.
Checking up on my friend, Harry.
Maybe it's this mix tape I made you. Or maybe these flowers. He gives Jessica the flowers and tape.
So no small talk? Good, 'cause I don't know how to make that. Yep. Small talk. Not for me. Not a fan.  Got any hobbies? How 'bout this weather?
Me too. I'm almost there.
This is so embarrassing, it's never happened before. Well, maybe a couple of times, but I was alone.
Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?
Uh-oh. Harry?
You know I do!
It's too close to call.  Okay next contest, now lets...
We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!
I reckon so.
Collins can be a pretty crafty guy, what do I do if he smells the trap.
Yes you are. 
But we don't drink from the house do we.
Small potatoes. This one is big time. This is visionary. This idea is genius.
Yes!
Guess what"s under these coconuts.
You got the Extender?
Everything?
The evidence of what?
JESSICA. Are you sure?
The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I...
The carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester. Try and get in close over the harvester... you'll find this interesting Sire. -- The Duke accelerates the ornithopter in the direction of the harvester. Paul can SEE...
Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
Yes?
Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
Yes?... How was your journey?
Yes.
I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."
Not sorry enough.
I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.
Here is why this Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer. Shadout is Chakobsa... knife, in Chakobsa is... maker of death.  It's a maker...
Is he....?
Yes...
To protect their territory. Vibrations attract them. -- PAUL  I've registered him now... a knife is a sheath on his left arm... He's strong... a person born to command... He's hiding many things.  Is there a relationship between the worms and the spice?

Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.

"Beg to differ?!"  Hey, I'm talkin' about my duplex in Burbank!
I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.
Ha!
I thought it was great.  You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie.
Yeah, it's gonna be a great picture! You'll love your character!  Bunny, Bela's here.  Look, hit the bars, work some parties, and get me transvestites!  <u>I need transvestites</u>!
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
Of course!  Dracula requires <u>presence</u>.  It's all in the voice, and the eyes, and the hand --
I didn't feel well...
Forget about it.  We'll make our new movie, and you'll be a star again.
That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
After I did "Dracula," the studio offered me "Frankenstein"!  But I turned it down, the part wasn't sexy enough.  It was too degrading for a big star like me.
Alright!  Let's put it on film. CAMERA!  SOUND!
No.  Seriously.  I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done for me.  A great man like you shouldn't have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning.
I wrote something special for you. I got to thinking about all the sacrifices you've made... and so I wrote you a new final speech.
Norma.  She changed her mind.  She doesn't wanna marry me.  Can you put down the gun?
I'm obsolete.  I have nothing to live for.  Tonight, I should die.  And you should come with me.
Oh.  So what is the scene about?
I dunno.  Lie on the beach?
If you say so.
What do you mean?
Nothin'!  I told him he was great.
Cris, you made it.  Thanks a lot.
Will he be okay?
It's a shame.  He's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore.
Since I was a kid.  My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.  It just kinda became a habit.
Of course it is.  And that's why you should play the part.
Don't get angry at me.  Maybe you just need a day job.
But there's plenty of other parts.
That's a good reason to dump your girlfriend.
Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
Yes.  Hollywood is oh so exciting.
Perhaps a small amount of money.  How much do one of your motion pictures cost?
Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
Wood?  Ward?  Wood.  Hey, what do you know.  It <u>is</u> Wood. Dang secretaries, you can never get a good one.  Right?
Screen Classics?  Hmm, don't know them.
Lugosi's washed-up.  What else you got?
Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.
Raising money is tough.
Would that work?
From outer space!  It's science- fiction.  <u>Very</u> big with the kids! If you make this picture, you'll have enough money to finance a HUNDRED religious films!  <u>And</u> pay my back rent from the profits.
Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
Okey-dokey.
The food will make you feel bedder. Look at me -- I'm da happiest guy I know!
Tell me about it.  I'm supposed to do a thriller at Universal, and they want Charlton Heston to play a <u>Mexican</u>!
You gotta be kiddin' me.
Yeah.  Crap with a star.
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
Hello.  You're sleeping in a tuxedo.
I got married last night.
What do you mean?
Hell, if I did, I wouldn't have any friends.
Who's Dr. Tom?
Huh?!
What's uncanny?
I don't know.
Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu."
I do.
Doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid?
And you're gonna make a bundle.  This movie's gonna be famous!  But only if you SHUT UP, and let me do it my way!
What are you, an angora wholesaler?
Oh.  Yeah.  You.
Isn't that the same thing?
What if I'm vomiting?
At the point -- I don't -- Look you'd be on TV maybe one or two times each. I'11 try to avoid I'11 go out of my way to avoid, getting together with you. Believe me.
Anything good?
She's in the kitchen. I'd yell for her, but I'd die.  You had a busy night last night.
Come on...
Look at your face. I had a car that color.
Yeah, so... ?
Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al.
No. Only celebrities now. Now, if you put a mailman on the cover of a magazine he'd better have killed someone or no one will buy it. This one to Dr. Rumpley.
No.
It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
What?!
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
This is real, Bananahead!
You know it.
A woman wants to be pursued.
No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.
Yes?
I ... don't know. I ...
Who?
You said that.
We're falling behind.
I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
Yeah, a thing. He became a big hero. He was on TV and there was a parade and a movie about him
And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
Yeah?
Yeah. The camera guy is here.
No! I -- All right, look, if you hear from Ray.... tell him to call me, okay?
He says --
St. Joseph's.
What is she, at work?
Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision -
You batted or you bunted?
Really? You see, to me, you shouldn't have any trouble with men. There should be, like, a line behind you.
I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they're really tangled... ?
Right.
I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
Leave. Go.
Go!
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other.
Really? 
Are you all right?
...yeah?
Everybody's someone.
It's nice.
My lovely assistant, Shari. I'm glad you asked. The contest is who can dig up -- legally, of course -- I'm not suggesting that anyone break any laws -- the most embarrassing and humiliating facts about any of the executives here at the North American Broadcasting System which owns Real TV.
Where were you?
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business.
Show business.
Why do you do that?
Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something?" Why don't you just ask me?
Yeah. You know, piano bars. plays the piano and sings. That's how they met.
Let's remember how I got into this. "Please, Eddie, do this for me. I can't get a break." 
What...
Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?
Don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that.

Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?
That's enough, Tracy.  Quit while you're ahead, okay?  I'll handle this.  Could you ask Walt to come in?
Take as much room as you want
Yeah... whatever.  All I know is she's a troublemaker.  She's on my list.
Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
Uh, Jim?
Thanks. Well. I'm going home now.
Possibly.  Please just wait outside.
Exactly when?
And how did you get in the school?
Your novel? Are you fucking kidding me?
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Three twenty-five.
But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.
Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
What...?
I'm not a dyke, okay, and we're not in love. We were just... I was just experimenting.

Well, I mean, you know, I talked to him and everything, but he just said he thought it was a good idea... and how there's all different kinds of fruit and...  It's nothing against you, Tracy. You're the best.  I just thought --
Yeah.
Thanks!
Don't you fucking knock?
Oh.  Hi, Tammy.  I was just, you know, I went to all your teachers and got your assignments.
Merry Christmas yourself, <u>Officer</u>.
Of course I am.  What kind of question is that?
You use words like that, you might make me mad.
Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
In the morning.
Say goodnight to your friend and join me by those back tables.
You've got it, Wendell.
What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
It's confidential, Bud.  Like that magazines Vincennes scams for. <u>Hush-Hush</u>.  I'll see you tomorrow.  And hey, if it works out, you'll get a piece of it.
Look at a picture for me.
It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  <u>Justice</u>.
What about him?
He no longer works for me.  Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. <u>Whatever you desire</u>.
Why were Lefferts' eyes black?
That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.
I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding my report.  You know how it goes.
What do you want to know?
Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
Yeah, so...
I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right.
Just show me where they are!
Some ferstunkener is moving in and we don't know who?!  Maybe we should ask Hedda Hopper!
In my car.  Blackmail shit.  The trunk under the carpet.  Patchett got me to photograph a cop fucking this gorgeous cunt Lynn, looks just like Veronicaaa --
Dudley, we've been over this.
Answer yes or no.
Yes, Dudley.  I am.
Why?
Something like that.
Not even with Exley?
I should've known.  What's the Chief throwing you?
You're playing an angle, college boy.  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  If they're making you a detective, watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.
Even I'm not that crazy.
What?
You should be the last person who wants to dig any deeper into the Nite Owl, <u>Lieutenant</u>.
So what's the point?
Bud White.  He sees us and we're dead.
I get the idea.  You got a description?
Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?
A vulgar term, but yes.
He said you were smart.  He also said you were competing with your dead father.  How did he put it? Trying to measure up to a ghost.
You don't like that you don't know how to play him.  He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do.  That makes him dangerous.
Some men get the world.  Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.
I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
All he found were rodents.  No signs of foul play.  So there.
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
Something good?
What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'
He's queer too.  Metro paid him two grand a week to fake it with ingenues.  On screen and off.  I'm getting him to fuck the D.A. for a hundred bucks.  That's twice the fifty you got for wrecking his career.
You didn't get my message?  It got called off.  The kid chickened out at the last minute.
What'd he give to you?
Nothing.
I have a professional relationship with Rachel Banks. She's the go- between for a private investigator I use.
Yes.
Who was that other guy?
Yes.
Okay.
You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
It's a SAT-tracker.
It means the NSA can read the time off your wristwatch.
Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
What if--
I was worried about my hundred and twenty 'K'.
You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
We're not gonna hurt you.
Drive.
Same thing?
If they couldn't do that, they'd shut down the whole system, all the relays.
It's Pat Cary. I work for Senator Sam Albert and I was given Jerry's name.
Jerry's on vacation 'till Monday. I can give him the message when he gets back. That was Patrick and the last name--
What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
With what?
Yes. I have her permission.
Very good.
I'll say.
That's my point.
I'm no expert, but I'm assuming that the impact of a moving bus against his body caused--
Than why can't you tell me.
I'm just trying to determine if Mr. Zavitz was involved in something more than a simple bus accident.
No.
He's got his priorities?
This is science-fiction Robert! The manager showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it.
I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.
This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
Brill.
Brill?
He doesn't work that way.
Mr. DePinto? My name's Robert Dean. I'm an attorney with Seth, Silverberg.
All right, look--
Tell me about Brill.
--otherwise we may have to--
Fuck you. You may have to--
My shoe?
Gimme the shoe.
You're firing me.
Bobby--
L.T., in this office I'd prefer you say Italian-Americans.
Why?
Because she's reading the newspaper, you asshole.
Really?
Are you and mom getting a divorce?
I'm not goin' anywhere, Eric. I live here.
No.
The blender?
I love my blender.
Table 122?
No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
So do I!
I need help.
You remember Daniel Zavitz?
It's hard to say for certain, these things are--
There are planes falling out of the sky, buildings blowing up. <i>American</i> buildings. <i>Americans</i> getting bombs in the mail. What are we gonna do!?
We're not gonna hand you and your band of lunatics the keys to the kingdom. I'm not gonna sit in Congress and write a law that allows the NSA to point a camera and a microphone at anything they damn well feel like. And the next time you have something to say to me, we do it above-board, in my office, like everyone else. Now get outa my car, I've got a committee meeting on the hill.
What about the tapes?
We found the originals.
Destroy his credibility before he goes public. Neutralize him. I don't want anyone listening to a word he has to say. Tell me about Rachel Banks.
Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
No sir.
Do you have visual?
He walked right up to me in church. At the holiest time of the wear. He approached me in a sanctified place.  Kill him now.
The fuck do you have goin' on with Sam Albert?
I don't know what's going on, but if you people have tripped over your own asshole again, you're not gonna get any help from us. It's ending at your doorstep.
No.
Then let's assume I don't.
A thing is still a thing no matter what you place in front of it.  Big car, slow car, chauffeur-driven car, still a car.
He said - be careful.
I'm quite all right, thank you.
They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
I believe you still have my book.
When were you least happy?
What do you hate most?
No.
I thought we were against ownership?  I can stay tonight.
No.
Of course.  You idiot.  I always wear it. I've always worn it.  I've always loved you.
Thank you.  Will you bury Geoffrey?  I know he's dead.
I desperately need a jeep.  There's been an accident.
I see.
If I could just see some identification.
You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
Cut the ropes.  I left a note, on his blanket.  At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot.  The Girl wouldn't leave, of course.  Her father had sold her for a camel. He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.
Bermann!
What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow.  I'm going to do what I can, but  And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so.
Thank you.
I don't know.
We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.
Don't cut me.
So was my Patient.
Ask him.  Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
I've had a drink.  Fatal.
Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
Me?
You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.
But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?
Yes, I got back there finally to keep my promise.  To come back for her. And then of course I couldn't I couldn't even do that properly.
Off with his head!
I'm fine.  I got hot.
I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.
My book?  The Herodotus?  Yes, we can read him.
I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.
Could I have a cigarette?
That's a different dress.
Do I recognize him?  I recognize what he is. I like him.  He's Canadian.  He can read Italian.  He can catch rabbits.
I don't think it's indifference.
Hey! -
Okay.  Get away from here.  Quick.
That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember?  That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot.
I should go to the house, get breakfast.
The lamp was burning all night in his room.  Caravaggio was there with him.
I mean home.  India.
No.  He's - no.
I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever you and Lieutenant Singh
I'll ask the Lieutenant.  But thank you.
Does he have to go?
I was looking forward to this evening.
I thought that was for when we were very very old?
I insist.  There clearly isn't room for us all, I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded. Those are facts.  Besides, if I remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us. It's hard to argue with this logic.
What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk.  And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British.
What have I been doing all this time? Do you know how many mines I've seen? - more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky.  And now this.
Go on, do it.  I don't need to hear any more.
Why?  Are you German?
This was your garden?
The windows don't open.
This is dangerous. I'm sending backup.
Who am I?
No you can't.
I can't?
That's good. Terrific.
You're joking.  You can't trust anyone these days.
The most important piece of Chinese art outside of China.
It's not for sale.
Not a word.
But--
Up to you. You could tell him the check is in the mail.
We're only going one way.
Certainly not mine. Come on.
I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.
I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.
In a week.
That's when we'll do it. And we'll need every single day.
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
Let's just see how we do.
My father told me not to be afraid. He'd always be there for me.
It's a party.
You're not on the beat.
My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
Okay, look, I'm delivering this to a man who's going to give us the key to our job. But it's pointless to try to explain it yet. You just have to trust me. I don't have any more secrets.
I'd taken the Mask?
Where the money is.
But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer.
It's no good without the argon gas.
Look, there's a video security system to bypass, that's the only hard part. You've done that a dozen times.
Seen one billion, seen them all.
No way.
Go!
Nothing is wrong. Everything is the way it has to be. In my left coat pocket is a packet. Passports, hotel reservations, tickets.
What about you?
My god--
You mean the seven billion.
Always in a rush.
Don't go getting sentimental. You're no damn good at it.
We're going to need a vacuum with a battery pack for the dust. The air filters might be wired. And a bypass hose for the AC.
Inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days.
It's a death mask. Death mask means dead.
But the second mouse gets the cheese.
You better not be taking on a new partner.
It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.
She won't tell me everything. It's a bank job, that's all I know.
Yes it does.
Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
His dry cleaners.  You want him?
Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?
Cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know -- you're making all new curtains.  Honest to God, I don't know if I have the energy.  You know, I've been sick. Me and Peter both have.
Yeah, I can see that.  I guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems aren't important, but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff?
It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking to?  He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list.
Yup.
I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --
I don't need pity.  I need a paycheck.  And I've looked, but when you've spent the last six years raising babies, it's real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn.  So I figure, since you're the one who said I was gonna be okay, you should be the one to hire me.
I guess I'm not the right kind.
I left a message.  I've been dealing with that real estate thing.  I was gonna write up a whole damn report and --
I don't know.  Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun.
You wanna know, you gotta hire me back.  I got a lot of bills to pay.
Course I did.
Yeah.  Isn't that a shame?
Me too.  That's why I like it.  It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about.
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
Boy, this job takes me to some of the best damn places, huh?
I was just asking.  Are you all right?
Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer.  20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it or leave it.
It's eight million dollars, Erin.  Eight million dollars.
Look, you said you weren't feeling great.  I thought you should rest.
Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
Cause you got a little voice in your head saying, do the right thing.  Give him another chance.
I think we should makes some changes.
Ross.
I don't know what you're talking about.
There's more than one kind?
Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?
Have you been to the water board?
County water board.  All righty, thanks.
Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin.  Brockovich. From the file room?  I was wondering if you could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up on that real estate thing out of the office.
Thank God we got you away from her, huh?
Just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.
Yeah.  Sexy, huh?  And here's another: five. That's how old my other daughter is.  Seven is my son's age.  Two is how many times I been married and divorced.  You getting all this?  16 is the number of dollars in my bank account.  454-3943 is my phone number. And with all the other numbers I gave you, I'm guessing zero is the number of times you're gonna call it.
Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer, I don't mind taking you up on it.
Better safe than sorry.
One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else.
If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so.
What?  Beth?  My Beth?
No, I wanna say hi.
Mm-hm.
We'll just be a minute.  Get a little more sleep.
That's okay.  I understand.
I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine.  I don't even know how much they cost.
A lot.  But you hang in there, maybe you'll get one.
Yes.  It's called accountability.
I am not talking to you, bitch.
You're moving away?  When?
Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.
Yes, My Lord.
This one I have watched a long time.  All his life has he looked away ... to the horizon, to the sky, to the future.  Never his mind on where he was, on what he was doing.  Adventure, excitement ...  A Jedi craves not these things!
You must.  Luke, look at me!
Yeah ...
Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do.
Patience.  It's time to eat.
Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?
Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am.  Can't we get on with this already?
I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.
Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
The kid ran into something mean, and it wasn't the cold.
It can wait.
We're in trouble!
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?
We are fighting for a cause much ...
An Imperial probe droid.
Right.  I'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones ...
Why?
Where?
Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?
I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
Are you kidding?
This ought to be good.
I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
Not actually .... Our operation is small enough not to be noticed, so you might say we're enterprisers. Most of our trade is, well ... unofficial.
I'm coming over to your side, that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going.
We have no choice.  Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.
Me too.  I was afraid.
What did you say?!
Luke, no!  It's a trap.
But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.
If it must be.  Yes.
Never.
And Earth will be destroyed -- just as we saw it.  Only, since fleeing it, we have passed through a....backward disturbance in time -- did you notice the Date Meter clicking down after the shock wave hit our ship? -- and we have returned to Earth almost two thousand years before its destruction.  That is another reason for keeping silence.  Our human captors would not be edified to know that, one day, their world will crack like an egg and fry to a cinder, because of an Ape war of aggression.
There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.
Security.  Join the Marines and see the Zoo ...
Yes, but don't take any chances.
Zero emotional developments. Total lack of compassion. A highly developed psychopathic instinct to survive.
Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
You told me he was dead.
Where's Plissken?
Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two armies. No one gets near him.
I got a new deal for you.
No, that sucks.  How are we getting out?
I don't know yet.
So you want me to take her out?  Is that an order from the President?
Lock fuel rods.
It's history. I gotta go.
You're free, Plissken. But if you even so much as break wind on a country road I'll crush you like a bug.
Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've been there, y'know.
No way.
All right. Anything for you, Snake.  Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones' place.
Cease fire with the bullshit.
All the sewers are collapsed under Venice. You have to go topside. Right up there.
You need help.
How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city.
What the hell is this?
Give me the prototype.
Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay.
--By itself it is only a piece of steel. Its power comes from he who wields it. For now there is no one. Do as I have ordered!
Move aside!
I will not.
I sought only not to harm you, sir.
But one can still keep a sword sharp riding out in the name of the King's law.
...Gawain and Perceval, Bors and Bohort, Caradoc and Ector, and all the others--lost to me. Only the echo of their voices remains in this empty hall. All I have left is the memory of their fellowship. Echoes and memories. I am a ghost of the King that once was...  ...Mordred is real, alive, my own flesh and blood. I will see him, I must.
Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
I dreamed of him too... Merlin lives! He lives in our dreams now, in that dark and shadowy place that is as strong and real as this more solid one. He speaks to us from there.
The book without pages. Open before you, all around us. You can see it in bits and pieces, for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance, why, it would burn him to cinders.
What?!
There are maidens as fair, and fairer than Guenevere. If I put my mind to it, I could see them now, many of them, weeping for love of you, watching the hills for you coming from the high towers of their castles. Offering you their every favor. Rich, clever--but if it is to be Guenevere, so be it.
What is it my child?
Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
Well hurry then, and get it.
I grant you your wish if you grant Lady Guenevere hers.
Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I was not born to live a man's life, but to be the stuff of future memory. The fellowship was a brief beginning, a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten, that fair time may come again. Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was, and the dream of what could be.
--It must wait, child. These good ladies, for whom I intervened once, will honor me with a meal. I am beholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection.
One land, one king! That is my peace!
I swear it.
Well what's wrong?
Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.
I didn't know that.
Ten maybe twelve years ago, in Africa. The exorcism supposedly lasted for months. I heard it damn near killed him.
Look, I'm telling you again and you'd better believe it, I'm not about to put her in a goddamn asylum!
Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!
Why don't you let me?
What didn't he tell you?
Watch out for drafts. A draft in the fall when the house is hot is a magic carpet for bacteria.
I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.
Oh, I see.
Well don't go now Karl the stores aren't open yet.
Never.
Are you sure?
Yeah, it would've helped. Have you gotta cigarette Father?
The priest.
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
Yeah well, it just so happens that somebody very close to me is probably possessed, and needs an exorcist.
No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,-
Could you see her?
What else?
No
What's the difference?
Father?
We'll see when we get home okay.
When can I have one?
I don't know
Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?
Why does God let us get tired?
Okay.
Where'd you get it then?
And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps!
If that's true, then you must know my mother's maiden name. What is it?
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
In time. But mirabile dictu, don't you agree?
Uoy era ohw.
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
But deliver us from the evil one.
And the son of iniquity be powerless to harm her.
Her heart.
Can you give her something?
She'll go into coma.
Really?
Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
Is that a threat?
Fuck him!!!
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
Are you a relative?
Yes I am her brother, he's the son
I don't know.
I'm afraid.
Yes.
Take it now.
So?
Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
Accident?
Yes, yes.  It's just that John is so much nicer. Jack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl, we had a pig on the farm named Jack. I guess I just can't help making the association.
I had a boy down at the camera shop cut them all together.  Boy, old man Henderson didn't fool around when he gave a haircut, did he, Jack?
Jack.
It was an accident.
It's only a ring.  Not a collar.
We gotta go, Jack.
You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
Nothing.  Everything's great. Terrific.
Your doorbell doesn't work.
What?
I don't know what you mean.
The hell you don't.
What was it like?
Talk.
If you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, I'd be glad --
All right.  What's your name?
I didn't get her number.
It's early.
Just like the day of the auditions, right?  Jesus.  How's my hair?
Get out of here.
That's it except for the first. We got the Sheraton, the Ambassador, or the Holiday Inn on Sixtieth.  All three-day turns.
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
So what do you think?
Right.
But if it doesn't work out, let me know.  I'm,flexible.
Right.  I love you, Frank.
What?
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano.
Two hours ago!
Yeah, well, she's our girl now.  I think we better keep an eye on her.  There's trouble there.  Hey, listen to this.  Ethel and Bert Lane. Married seventy-five years.  You believe that?
Thinking there's someone who looks like you, walking around the street somewhere.  Wonder if I saw him I'd think it was you?
Huh?
He's with the hotel.  I called him.
We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it.
A gift.  Courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, Mr. Daniels.  We, dear brother, are a fucking smash.  Yup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids. Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open.  It's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. Slippery business.
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
Maybe so.  You ever go back there?  Where it happened.
I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
What channels it on?
Seventy-one?  What's seventy-one?
What?
Oh ... I was just hoping for something to drink.  But it seems the old lady was dry. Not even a bottle of cooking sherry.
I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're doing the stone today.  It's okay?  Wednesday?
Right.  It was someone's birthday. Halloran?
Just call me a cab.
Right.
What do you mean?
Look, miss.  We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.
Don't take it personally.
What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.
Uh ... we'll let you know.
When we know.
What-?
Changed?
Is there a language problem here?  Your dress. For tonight.  Where is it?
We're not exactly silly with time, you know.  Jack, you find anything?
Give me that.
I was gonna split it with you guys.
Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
Smells like fish.
I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?
Susie.  It's one more show.  One more time.  That's all.
How come?
Right.  In there.
All right. they lay the dead ones out in the cold room.  I'll take a look.
I suppose.
It's been a long time, Ma.
Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais by the time I got out there anyway.
In and out.
Practice.  There are worse songs, you know. Not many, but a few.
Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
Sure.
Soap?
No kidding?
Ma didn't want it around.  After.
Coffee?
Yeah.  Got my own sign.
Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure.  You two.
Terrific.  I'm doing vegetables next week.
Huh?
I've given it up.
I didn't want to wake you.
Thanks.  For letting me in last night.
No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.
It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
Eddie did.
What happened to the donut king?
The recent past.
How do you know?
I guess it's getting serious.
I hope not.  He's already busted the springs in two chairs.  Hey, what's this?
That's what I want to do. I want to make a snowman.
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
You mean if I get sick?
Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing.  At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it.
And I bet I've kept that promise ...
It's important.
Totally -- you were being very, very bad.  You went up in the plane and jumped out.  You had a parachute, but it didn't open.
How come?
You want me to tell you it's okay to leave?  Okay, go on!  GO!
Jon, what is it?
Jon, if I'm not there, he will be tipped off.  I'll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together.
Apparently, fine.  He's coming into work.  That's the good news ...
Either way, come Saturday morning -- I'm pulling you the hell out of there.
You missed the last three, including her birthday.  Your wife's gripe sheet.
I believe the phrase Dr. Hoag used was "titanically remote."  Who knows?  Maybe the trauma of having my face cut off pulled me out.  Or maybe God really is on my side after all.  By the way, I know you don't get the papers in here.
Too late, your kid worships me.  And your wife -- she's an animal.  Even I can't keep up with her.
Shoot him!
Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
Let's try to be a little less formal from now on, shall we?
You better get used to it. That bitch Lazarro is getting kicked upstairs. Guess what white-bread family man is going to replace her?
Yeah -- it's Santa's Magic fucking Village.  Your present's in here.
All of them do.  We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb.  And we'll be rich.
Good, because I checked your salary -- and it bites.  How the everyday working-class stiff survives in today's economy is something I'll never ...
No problem.
Normally, I would.  But today ...
Me.  I have doubts about your ability to stick with what is essentially a desk job.
-- I've got to study.
Can't you see I'm trying to change?  I sent Jamie off because I wanted to be alone with you.  I wanted to see the candle-light dance in your beautiful --
Good.  Because I'm fed up.
You?  Married?
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
Adelle?
Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
You know how to make chocolate milk?
Sure.
Check...
Mom liked it.
Right.  Thats a major oversight...  So if Im Kate...I cant really afford the finer things, my husbands career is a crushing disappointment to me, Im trapped in suburbia...
Ah. A classic...
Ringing my bell...
No, honey. Go back to sleep.
Maybe I dont say it enough but you moving in next door to me...
Screw the rules.  Im talking about the choice.
Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise itll be returned!
The Caddy?  Why dont you take your own damn car!
Ive got all the time in the world...
Me?
Sure it's about you.  But it's about society, too.
No?  Cmon, Jack...Ive got everything I need, I dont have regrets, thats just not for me... sound familiar?
Look Jack Im late.  Id love to help you out some more but I gotta go handle my business...  Happy trails.
Need a nurse?
Thank you.
I know weve talked about this a thousand times and we both agree that going to London is the right thing to do. But in my heart... this feels wrong.
I was in the city.
Party?  Oh no, I cant go to a party...
Its an unbelievable thing.  Wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person.  Im gonna buy it...
Maybe youre not.  The Jack Campbell I married wouldnt need a $2400 suit to make himself feel better about his life, but if thats what its gonna take, then buy it. Just buy the goddamn suit ...we can take the money out of the kids college fund.
No, I love Annie.  We had a lot of good times, didnt we?
Its good, right?
What are you talking about?  You never wait all day.  You can barely wait until its light out.
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
I already told you you were gonna get lucky, Jack...
Its like a museum.
I dont think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  Well put Annie and Josh in private schools...
This is New York City, its like the needy people capital of the world.  Those Jersey clients of yours arent a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...
Jack.
I promise. Come to bed, honey.
Not exactly...  Can we just take a minute here?  Maybe get a cup of coffee or something...?
Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
Then leave it in the past. Old flames are like old tax returns.  You keep `em in the file cabinet for three years and then you cut `em loose.
Youre a little tougher, Peter.
Hey, are you okay?
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
Solid.
I think I need to lie down.  Bad shrimp.
Back on Earth.  Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
I don't care about rocks, I care about <u>you</u>.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
Don't come any closer for a sec.  This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
I'm worried about you.
Well why didn't you say so?  You want me to lift some weights or something?
Oh, he did.
<u>What</u> did he do to the uniform?!
Cool.  What'd it do to you guys?
No: You're <u>ON FIRE</u>!
<u>Girl</u>...?!
Blockhead started it!
But Johnny...you <u>can't fly</u>.
Front page?
I was talking about us.  Working together.
That's good.  That's uh...good.
That's what we're here to find out.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
No, I distinctly remember: <u>you</u> walked out <u>my</u> door.  Ergo...
That would have kinda defeated the purpose.  And Reed...  I'm saying it now.
Oh, I think you already have.
I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny.  At least they can go out in public.  But for you?  People staring. Whispering behind your back...
Phase Two.
Message to Proteus.
They'll make up some time, once they get through that and reach the Pleural Cavity.  Respiration Post...
What can I do? Except maybe pass out?
I wouldn't know if he's trying to save him or kill him.
Not even for a minute! General Carter, sir, I'd like you to reconsider your choice. I'm just not the right man for a mission of this kind.
Yes, Cora.
I -- I want to say...
I don't know yet, Doctor. And I won't know until I test it.
I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.
Not now. We need air, not greetings!
A surgeon might...
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
Look! They follow the direction of her glance, are startled to see:
I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
Not in a sealed vessel like an Artery.  Captain -- something must be wrong with your controls!
Nothing -- against all that force.
All I'm asking is you test it beforehand!
Take a close look at your Soul, and your Infinity, and your God out there --
Request removal, Mr. Grant.
I -- I don't know what to say. I know he's under a cloud, but there's not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession.
I can't tell you that either... Excuse me, Mr. Grant, but you've got a smudge on your cheek.
Nothing you could see with the naked eye. But there's a microscopic radio-active particle inside.

On the Repeater.
Was there any damage?
Well, see, there's a minimum charge of four dollars. Long-term parking charges by the day.
I got your goddamn money, you little punk. Now where's my daughter?
Where's my daughter?
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
Drop that fucking money!
Certainly.
What?
I'm fuckin' hungry now, you know.
Okay.
I'm not gonna sit here and debate. I will say this though: what Shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense.
What kind of trouble are you in, Jerry?
Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -
Blood has been shed, Jerry.
What the heck d'ya mean?
Okay, real good, then.
And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead and I don't mean a old age.' And then he says, 'Geez, I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake.'
White Bear Lake?
So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I don't think a whole great deal of it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought I should call it in, so I called it in. End a story.
What'd this guy look like anyways?
Uh-huh - in what way?
Yah.
Yah, that can happen.
Yah.
And yet you're gettin' C grades. It's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me.
Oh, man!
Oh, those numbers are all right, bleemee.
Yah!
You bet.
No, no, nothin's goin' wrong here. Grandad and I, we're - we're makin' sure this gets handled right.
No! We can't let anyone know about this thing! We gotta play ball with these guys - you ask Stan Grossman, he'll tell ya the same thing!
Huh? Yah?
Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing.
but do you know that for sure without -
I'm not, uh, I'm not arguin' here. I'm cooperating... There's no, uh - we're doin' all we can...
I'm sorry, sir, I -
Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it.
But I already got the, it's okay, the loans are in place, I already got the, the what, the -
Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month.
Yah, okay, I'll have my girl send you over a copy, then.
Well, yah, I got an idea. How's that Ciera workin' out for ya?
This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC. Sir, I have not yet received those vehicle IDs you promised me.
Good day, sir.
...Yah.
Yah, okay.
Yah, you said you'd have a think about it. I understand it's a lot of money -
Come by at 2:30 and we'll talk about it. If your numbers are right, Stan says its pretty sweet. Stan Grossman.
2:30.
Yah.
But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.
Yah.
Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.
You don't think he's mixed up in -
No, no, I just wanna get Norm some night crawlers.
Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR?
No motels registered any tan Ciera last night. But the night before, two men checked into the Blue Ox registering a Ciera and leavin' the tag space blank.
Gotta go?
Great. What brings ya down - are ya down here on that homicide - if you're allowed, ya know, to discuss that?
Well, they're a good outfit.
Yah, if you're an engineer, yah, you could do a lot worse. Of course, it's not, uh, it's nothin' like your achievement.
Yah, well, I, uh... it's not that it didn't work out - Linda passed away. She, uh...
It's okay...
Well, you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace?
Uh-huh.
Yah?
...Well, yah. Who's this?
Oh. Oh, my.
Copy.
Prowler needs a jump.
Norm, that's terrific!
Yah, I guess.
We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
Where's Tyler?
There's no one else here.
...using steroids.  I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls...
Really, what's that?
And the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule...
Bob, Bob... I'm a member.
Yeah, both of us.
It must've been Tuesday.  he was wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.
You want me to de-prioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade?
Some of it, yes.
Okay.  Where to begin?  With your constant absenteeism?  With your unpresentable appearance?  You're up for review...
Just who the fuck do you think you are?!  Get out!  You're fired!
No, I wasn't aware...
What does that mean?
Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
Telling me off.  Is it going as well as you hoped... ?  "... Mr. Taylor."
A year?  How'd you manage that?
You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
I don't know -- am I?
Like testicular cancer?
What the hell are you doing here?
It suits you.
Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive and I'm in poverty.  You want any?
I could check your prostate.
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
What?
Marla, it's me.  Have we... have we ever had sex?
We've just lost cabin pressure.
Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm coming over there...
Oh, yeah.
Well... let me see... here's the thing...
Is this part of the test?
Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
Okay, everyone.
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
Why would anyone want this shitty job?
Is it?
Anyone.
Doesn't matter.
Hemingway.  You?
Okay... Ghandi.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Okay.
Yes, I promise.
Shut up.  Our fathers were our models for God.  And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
We don't need him...
Yeah.  Where you headed?
You're asking questions that don't have answers.  You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else.
... is over.
And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South.
Why do people think anything?
Is this really news to you?
We're going to have to do something about Marla...
Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
She's... you... you're fucking her.
...your sentences!  They're our sentences.  Get your mind around that.
If you know, I know.
This is not about martyrdom.
Bob is dead, Tyler.  The police blew a hole in his head.  Was that part of your plan?
Defuse the bomb, please.
Paraffin.  Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin.  I saw it floating in the bomb. 
Why what?
No, no, I don't.  I thank you, I really do.  Thank you, but I don't need you anymore.
Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?
Not my mouth.  Our mouth.
It's the only way to get rid of you...
What?
My eyes are open.
Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
Very good, Sir.
But, this is Project Mayhem.
Irvine?  Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.
It's free to all.
How'd you know?
Congratufuckinglations.  That makes you last to go.  But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.  Always does.
That still doesn't make sense.  You said you die in the same order you were originally meant to.  But Evan Shaeffer died last in my premonition, not first.
The songs on the radio.  But wait.  I don't understand.  Why is this even happening to me?
Then it wasn't just a sign. It was a premonition?
No.  If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me.  But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.  I'm last on Death's list.
I don't think so.  Alex's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it.
I was dead.  And came back to life. An EEG machine.  Where's Eugene?
I have to save Eugene!
Taken care of.
That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay, it has not been edited.
What about the rest of you?  Kimberly, you were driving to Daytona.  Was Route 18 your first choice?
Blow me.
Of course not.  That would be irresponsible and unprofessional.
Take a guess.
Clean up?  I don't...
They're next on the list.  We have to find them.
We have to tell her she's in danger!
I know how it feels to be dead.
I don't...what if I made a mistake?
Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
How does a nice mature fuck sound?
I know, Dad.
I don't know what I'd do if I lost you.
Yeah?
Like you, the sculpture doesn't even know what, or why, it is. Reluctant to take form. And, yet, creating an absolute but incomprehensible attraction.
Right. April 25th.
Let us out!
When I do this.. it'll have skipped you... and it'll all be over.
Dude, get wisdom. We're about to board a seven hour flight. The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. What if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in Christa or Blake?  You want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes?
Because of you, I gotta sit here and watch fuckin' "Stepmom."
"Next?"
Why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide?
You saying Tod did kill himself?
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
You stopped.
Yeah.  Second set.  Let's go.
Show me how it operates.
We're leaving tonight, not in a week.
I suppose you have...
Crazy motherfucker.
Where's his father?
Nguyen is good boy.
Where?
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
That's right.
Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.
Black.  No sugar.
Listen, Kirkhill.  I'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... I thought I'd go out with the extraction team tonight.  Unless you have an objection.
Look, Colonel... we're all adults here.  This is a war.  A very quiet, very intense war.  People get sacrificed.
You think I'm some whacko?  I like to hurt people?  I'm doing a job here.  If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right?  So I follow directives... I do what I'm told.  It's simple.  If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.
This mission was a scam from the word go?
Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
What did you want?
Ah... I do them myself.  I used to work in a beauty parlor.
Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
The nails!! Watch the nails!!...  Listen, you still have to eat.
Okay.  ... I love you...
I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second.
You're calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office. You must think I'm some dope.  You fuckin' bastard... You...  ... stay out all night long...
He's not a moron.
Thank you very much.
I think they're made for each other. And it scares me.
Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?
I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
She <u>likes</u> me.  She said for me to call!
A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
People spend a lot of hard earned money for this neighborhood.  It's not fair... looking out their windows to see your ass asleep on the streets...
You can ask.
How un-sixties of you.
Well..um...you get an official membership card...  Just sign that and we'll laminate it right here... Parry?  You want to laminate Miss Sinclair's card?...
Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
Sshhhh!
God... I'm the janitor of God.
Can I take you to lunch?
You're a true <u>friend</u>.
I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
The Red...?  You're totally gone, aren't you?
Then let's begin with the story itself. It's a story of the Grail myth...And although there are several variations, my favorite begins with the Fisher King as a young boy... who had to spend a night alone in the forest to prove his courage... and during that night, he is visited by a sacred vision. Out of the fire, appears the Holy Grail - God's highest symbol of divine grace. And a voice says to the boy, "You shall be the guardian of the Grail, that it may heal the hearts of men"...But the boy was overcome ...Innocent and foolish, he was blinded by greater visions - a life ahead filled with beauty and glory, hope and power...Tears filled his eyes as he sensed his own... invincibility. A boy's tears of naive wonder and inspiration. and in this state of...radical amazement...he felt for a brief moment, not like a boy, but like God...  ...And so he reached into the fire to take the Grail. And the Grail vanished. And the boy hands were left caught in the flames...leaving him wounded and ashamed at what his recklessness had lost him. When he became King, he was determined to reclaim his destiny and find the Grail... But with each year that passed, with each campaign he fought, the Grail remained lost, and this wound he suffered in the fire grew worse... He became a bitter man. Life for him lost it's reason. With each disappointment, with each betrayal... with each loss ... this wound would grow... Soon the land began to spoil from neglect and his people starved...Until finally, the King lost all faith in God's existance and in man's value...He lost his ability to love or be loved And he was so sick with experience... that he started to die. As the years went on, his bravest knights would search for the Grail that would heal their King and make them the most respected and valued men in the land, but to no avail.  Pretty soon, finding the Grail became a ruthless struggle between ambitious men vying for the King's power, which only confirmed the King's worst suspicions of man, causing his wound to grow. His only hope, he thought, was death. Then one day, a fool was brought in to the King to cheer him.  He was a simple-minded man... not particularly skilled...or admired... He tells the King some jokes...sing him some songs, but the King feels even worse...Finally, the fool says, "What is it that hurts you so much? How can I help?"...And the King says, "I need a sip of water to cool my throat"...So, the fool takes a cup from the bedstand, fills it with water and hands it to the King...Suddenly, the King feels a lot better. And when he looks to his hands, he sees that it was the Holy Grail the fool handed him...an ordinary cup that had been beside his bed all along...And the King asks, "How can this be?...how could you find what all my knights and wisest men could not find"? And the fool answers, "I don't know. I only knew you were thirsty."... And for the first time since he was a boy, the King felt more than a man - not because he was touched by God's glory...but rather, by the compassion of a fool.
BINGO! Tell the man what he's won!
No just Parry.
I don't like horror movies!
Yeah.
Well - empires have fallen because of trashy romances...
Well, I'm in search of the Holy Grail.
No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.
I never say anything I have to.
Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
And then we'll exchange phone numbers and you'll leave and never call and I'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch.  Why am I putting myself through this?  It was very nice... uh meeting you. Good night..
My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty, and her name's Twinky.
I'm not.
I'm sorry.
Who said I was depressed?
No.
Yeah. That's before the big thaw.
Am I on TV?
Well, you seem very professional...
Now don't...
Well, Herbert's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra, so at the moment, there's just Daddy, Carl and myself... and Van Oost.
Daddy's very ill.
Wait...
Well, I'll be seeing you in a couple of days, won't I?
No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
We can't all get up and leave, can we? I mean, there are certain needs you have to respond to...
Sometimes.
You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...
Oh, let's not talk about my hair, it does what it wants to, and anyway, who cares, I want to talk about you...
You know, he was formerly a sailor.
Where's Catherine?!
And you no longer play at all?
Swimming?
Then after that?
Tomorrow, then.
If you're free.
I didn't have any.
At being a fake.
I think it's what you think.
I don't think that's accurate...
Shut up...
I'm fine.
Yes.
What?
I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.
I'll be back later...
Is she?
Nothing. Will you excuse us for a while?
What do you mean? Aside from my neck, I'm in superb shape.
You're all full of shit!
For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
Besides being very rude.
Well, I should hope not...
Hold onto this.
And they picked up! I mean, it wouldn't be filthy, with Coke bottles and whiskey, and those signs everywhere...
Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
I have a suggestion. Why don't we take a break.
Remember me, from the pool?
No.  What you do today?
You know. I got a lot, more than one.
Me? No. Don't want none either. Such bastards, man.
You look good.
I can't!
Fa what?
I won't let my motha cut my hair.
She fucks it all up!
I'll be right down.
If we were at 10th Street Pool you woulda done it right in the water, right?
I think by Twenty-two.
I think he's 18 or 17.
She's like this high, dark hair, skinny
My friend told me she lived around here.
Not really.
You gotta girLfrLend?
Hmm. It's just that there are some other people from my office going on this trip and... is there anyone in the seat next to me?
Oh, thanks.
He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
Fletch, this is dumb.
You don't have to run with me, Crease.
Fletch F. Fletch
What'll it be Fletch?
That a boy.
Thank God, the police.
Your 'foolproof' way is going to land my ass on the front page while you're basking in Rio.
Yes.
Mrs. Smith.
I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
Honest, I feel fine. You better be married.
Thanks, Doc. Maybe I'll come back with a date. Or an elephant.
Okay. Some idea.
For sure?
I think Id rather have drugs.
You don't know me.
My pleasure.
Thought so. What for?
Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.
That's it.
I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
Whoops.
Well, I'm fully covered.
California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
Velma.
Check.
Since he moved to L.A.
Then he has.
Of course they are.
Yeah. Maybe.
Maybe I'm just on vacation.
I rent them. Monthly lease, with an option to buy.
Very good. My .357. Use it and no one can trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray.
Sure, all drifters do.
They serve dinner on the flight?
Can I steal you for a minute?
Only if you promise not to return me.
Shoot.
Not our kind of people, you understand.
Maybe.
I wonder if that's his doctor.
Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.
Oh, personal stuff. Look! I hit one!
I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
Here, take mine.
'I've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching...'
I think you should call me Gail, now.
Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him.
I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?
Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and I wasn't at your wedding.
So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.
What does all this mean?
What are you talking about?
Oh God, I hate things that start like that....
Gail, please.
You can't do that.
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
No wonder.
I commend him on his choice
Don Corleone. I'm a cousin of Mrs. Cavanaugh's.
She moved out.
I'm her cousin.
No, I want an answer, Is the story done?
I don't know.  Look!
I'd say charcoal.
I really don't want to spoil your surprise, Frank. Why don't you read it tomorrow?
Get out of here.
You'll have it.
You were going to can me, right?
But I ain't got you...
I don't know, I never met your father.
Who's your decorator?
I don't have a sense of humor, either.  Sorry.
Actually, you may take it all now.
Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
I'm sorry, that's gotta be a pair of tube socks he has down there.
Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
You're not funny.
Who cares about people?
Hah fluck, great video, huh?
Are you okay?
Ye-ah.
No, wait...
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny.
Why have you come to my planet?
You wish.  Come on, let's get outta here.
Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.
Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
If you're hiding something... oh, oh, I'll have so much fun.
Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
The case!
Let me go out like a man.
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Don't worry I can run every ballet note for note in my brain...
Shock.
Golly, I'd probably faint.
Don't play games... ugh.  Did you say you don't have the third... ugh.  I'm not going to torture <u>you</u>, Ford.
Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
Accident?  Accident!  You naive pussball, when I realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry.  I <u>cut my fucking</u> <u>ears off</u> so I'd only hear <u>my</u> music. Here, look.
Julian, you're fired.
It's my daughter, man.  I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.  She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros.  You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
What?
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
Not quite -- you are in it whether you like it or not.  The police know you brought the car into the country.  This makes you an accomplice.
Si tu veux.
But will they?
He got off on six.
Names.
What's he do?
This Charnier guy.  He's in shipping?
Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?
When ya go back on?
Whyn't ya stretch out on the pool table for a couple hours.  The kid comes in at six will wake ya.  A couple eggs and a beer is cheaper than keepin' a dog around the joint.
He coulda been white.
Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.
Toy wit' this will ya.
He was the bank on that shipment outta Mexico three years ago.
It was a crematorium.
For dead bodies.
What I know is what I told you.
That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
Where's the collar, in the cells?
One way to find out.
I think I ruined the sauce...again.
You didn't marry Donna Reed.
Do you know how much I love you?
I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come outside.
Satch, would you listen to me here.  Just you and me.  Can I talk to you here, alone?
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
Satch, you gotta listen to me...
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
WB2YKXB, who've I got?
Pal, my whole life's an emergency.
Uh huh...
What?
My dad's name was Frank Patrick Sullivan, he was a fire fighter and a die-hard Mets fan.  And every night when I went to bed he sang to me...  Take me out to the ball game, take me out with the crowd...
Nah, I gave it up.
No wait, don't go!
I lost you.
Yeah.  I'm okay.  What about you?  I want to know.  About you.  And your mom.
Dad, we did something.  Something to make it worse.
So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
I do know.  I'm a cop.  This is what I do.
What if the radio stops working?  Christ, what if I can't reach you again?
Whatta we do now?
How?
What are we like in...1998?
Well, game five was the big one.  It turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2 2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We won, Pop.
He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
Just a minute, John...okay?  Don't go away.
I don't remember.  Why don't I remember?
What the hell is that smell?
No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
Yeah.  That's it.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah...I remember.  I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?
I hear that.
It's a small world, Carl.  And I'm gonna find you.  Real soon.
Where are you going?
"He" wanted me to warn you.  Look at this, all of you!
Would you be yourself...  ...if you looked this this?
Your bed.
I'm trying.  I'm really trying.
Sort of.
Why don't you help us?
Come on, Shelly.  Who else is gonna give him a lift?
Excuse me, but I believe that's mine...
Just a dirty window.  Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that.  Let's just hope that "next time" isn't too soon.
Who's Horace?
What?  Who pulled it out?!
Stay cool?  You ain't Dirty Harry. Now stop it.
When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
He is.  Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true...  ...You stay put.  And I'm not kidding.
You're gonna be sorry if you don't shut the fuck up.
Yeah, that'd be a big shame...
'Night, Josh.
That's what I'd like to know.
Tell me.
Sorry.
You think you can lock me up in this piss-ass prison?  Hell, this place is motel fuckin' six to me.
Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?
Oh my God, Steven.
Randy, c'mon!
I'm sorry.  I have to bring you to a cell.
I've told you the truth.
The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
Look, I know I treated her bad --
Disgusting?  Bingo night was sold out for six months after that!  They raised enough money to build a day care center.
So what else is new?  Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend.
He bought you that?
Never mind, you don't want to know about it.
And you'll never do it again.
And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
She changed her mind.  Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are in two-twenty-five.
Then I'll make sure you remain on board while your classmates see the sights.
Where is she?
I'm staying.
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
I...I can't...
I gathered that.
No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
But I didn't get you one...
Forget it. It's a dumb little thing anyway.
Drugs...  Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.
I opened thousands of brains.
Ruptured steam pipe.
Do not inhale.
Elliot Litvak. Have you been ill? And Mr. Rogan. How nice.
Press a button and they give us money.
It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
What's the fuss? I don't get it.
What was it like?
We're talking about something deeper than grudges. How do we respond to personal attack?
They can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. There's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.
It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
I didn't turn her into Mother. You did.
It's only our first date.
This building is not secure.
Mystery. Deception.
All right. What's been going on?
I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier.
Who the hell cares?
Laurel wants us to be honest and open. Let's be open with each other.
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
She's my gynecologist.
Life is good.
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
I'm on my way to get a haircut.
Where does Nicky get his hair cut?
It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
But the son is suppose to stop crying.
I could have grown up happy. A Yankee fan. A divorce lawyer.
You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.
I know, Pop.
What do you want me to do?
Show him who we are.
That's a simple subject.
Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?
I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
It's a simple subject.
Speak it like it's real. Matthew.
Because life is good.
It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.
This could be it!
How come?
When the Mets lose, they just lose. It's a flat feeling. But the Red Sox -- here we have a rich history of interesting ways to lose a crucial game. Defeats that keep you awake, that pound in your head like the hammer of fate.
Eleventh inning. What else?
Mine was cobalt blue.
There was a review.
The fact is, I have to get going.
I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.
I haven't come to you.
Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.
The truth is never gentle. Listen to me carefully. Each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams. Truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin. It hurts and maims.
I'm going home to my machine.
I am your wife.
There's no room! And the air is lovely.
Jinnah has -- has cooperated with the British. It has given him power and the freedom to speak, and he has filled the Muslims with fears of what will happen to them in a country that is predominantly Hindu.  That I find hard to bear -- even in prison.
I'm sorry.
I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.
Yes. I've -- I've met some very remarkable people in India... and -- and when I read what you've been doing here, I -- I wanted to help.  Does that surprise you?
"Hell!"
No, no -- just a moment, please.
We must end the campaign.
Wait and see... wait and see...
Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand.  It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns.
I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.
That's when you take advantage.
I can. But I risk being kicked into the gutter by someone less "holy" than Mr. Baker.
Somehow I expected not.
Have you found him?
Er, no...
It would be five thousand more.
I'll see what I can do.
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
With respect, Sir--it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests--
No.  But one or two "borrowed ladders" have shown up there in the past.
Where do we start?
What a relief.
Now <i>you're</i> here.  Who are your "friends"?
Noone orders southpaws anymore.
Leave?  Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving.  I see it as going home.
You don't know what a relief it is not to be me.  Are you sure <i>you</i> want the job?
You wish.
They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.
This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?
What <i>is</i> that one?
They think I offed the Director.
They found my eyelash.
Is that all?
Good choice.
Never stopped you before.  And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.
Michael's.
We'll still be able to talk when I'm away. The conversation will just keep getting longer.
In case you get back before I do.
We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren.
They are not babies, Maria, merely "human possibilities".
I hope he's not just a body.
I'd have to bleach my hair.
You worried about the cost?
I've found him too.
They found an eyelash.
I don't think so.  The only trip I'll make in space is around the sun--  --on this satellite right here.
The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.
That Beynon's got a long arm.
Whisky and a peach.
That's not all of it.
Suit yourself.
Bullshit.
We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.
Jackson panicked and nailed the guard.
What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore?
Who's she?
Like what?
If Beynon bought him out, and he talked then maybe Beynon's boys will be waiting for us in El Paso.
Not now.
I think so... I don't know.
You and me.
Laughlin. He's always got his family around... that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses.
Get your clothes on, move your butt.
Where do we go from here?
They will have our description before we can get a plane.
Whatever happens... we're going all the way.
Me, too. Got twenty-four days of furlough and I'm goin' home.
That certainly makes you kind of special...
That little job cost me a hundred dollars... didn't even get to keep the fish.
Chambers - Reilly. Time lock opens 20 minutes before they start doing business...
I'm good at that.
Aren't we going a little hard?
Just sandwiches...
Can't leave the desk.
Just fine.
That's what I want.
Don't worry about me, I'll grab a cab... I can afford it, you know.
Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
I know. I know.
I know.
Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.
Why?
Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits.
You stay in the car. I'll come and listen.  What you want to tell me, Thorpey?
I must go. I'm in a hurry.
Tomorrow morning, then?
Nicer than most.
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
What was bugging Frank?
Tell me about the girl.
The young girl. Who pulled her?
Yeah.
Your brother? What you talking about?
Have another?
Yes.
Nice family, are they? Church-goers and all that?
Since when did he drink whisky?
Right.
Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.
All right. All right. I want to square things with you first.
I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a course in karate.
I'll bet this one's seen some action.
Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right.
Stick the soft soap. Let's be having it.
How'd you know I wouldn't?
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
Think about it.
Oh, that's nice.
It would be. If they were still living.
A bereavement. A death in the family.
Still got a sense of humour?
Do you know, I never knew he worked in one of my places!
No? Funny that. Neither did I.
He said it'd be doing him a big favour.
The gun he means.
Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  Give him the bloody bottle.  Now, where are we?
Your hundred, and another hundred.
Shut up.
...they hold on to their money...
You missed a fucking sale.  Big deal.  A deadbeat Polack.  Big deal. How you going to sell 'em in the first place...?  Your mistake, you shoun'a took the lead.
They killed the goose.
We're stuck with this...
...this shit...
It's too...
It's not right.
That's right?
Goddamn right, that's right.  Guys come on: "Oh, the blah blah blah, I know what I'll do: I'll go in and rob everyone blind and go to Argentina cause nobody ever thought of this before."
For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives..."
Yes, it is.  And you know who's responsible?
The nurses?
What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
That's the God's truth.  And it gets me depressed.  I swear that it does.  At MY AGE.  To see a goddamn: "Somebody wins the Cadillac this month.  P.S. Two guys get fucked."
You build it!
That's what I...
When they...
What?
The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.
How do you know he'd buy them?
Graff?  Because I worked for him.
As an idea.
Hey.
We are?
He'd give me a job.
What?  What?  The leads.
You want me to break into the office tonight and steal the leads?
Well, to the law, you're an accessory.  Before the fact.
What is the five grand?  What is the, you said that we were going to split five...
What?  You can't do any what?
Clear Meadows.  That shit's dead.
I am?
Thank you, George.
In school.
I'm sure that we're insured, George... 
Just go to lunch.
Please don't leave.  I'm going to talk to you.  What's your name?
I'm going to have your job, shithead. I'm going downtown and talk to Mitch and Murrray, and I'm going to Lemkin.  I don't care whose nephew you are, who you know, whose dick you're sucking on.  You're going out, I swear to you, you're going...
It isn't me...
Murray said...
I'll tell you why I'm out.  I'm out, you're giving me toilet paper. John. 
...apart from the top men on the contest board.
I can't close these leads, John. No one can.  It's a joke.  John, look, just give me a hot lead. Just give me two of the premium leads.  As a "test," alright?  As a "test" and I promise you...
No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.
Is that it?  Is that it?  You want to do business that way...?
Did you tell 'em my sale?
All that I'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale.
You can't think on your feet you should keep your mouth closed.  You hear me?  I'm talking to you. Do you hear me...?
Don't fuck with me, John, don't fuck with me...what are you saying?
John: John:...my daughter...
And did they steal the contracts...?
"You have to believe in yourself... you"--look--"alright...?"
Bruce..."I don't want to fuck around with you.  I don't want to go round this, and pussyfoot around the thing, you have to look back on this.  I do, too.  I came here to do good for you and me.  For both of us.  Why take an interim position? 
I just put Jim into Black Creek...are you acquainted with...
Yes.
Sure.
The monthly interview...?
Ricky...
I don't know.  For me, I'm saying, what is is, it's probably not the orgasm.  Some broads, forearms on your neck, something her eyes did. There was a sound she made...or, me, lying, in the, I'll tell you: me lying in bed; the next day she brought me caf au lait.  She gives me a cigarette, my balls feel like concrete.  Eh?  What I'm saying, what is our life?  It's looking forward or it's looking back.  And that's our life. That's it.  Where is the moment?  And what is it that we're afraid of? Loss.  What else?  The bank closes.  We get sick, my wife died on a plane, the stock market collapsed...the house burnt down...what of these happen...? None on 'em.  We worry anyway. What does this mean?  I'm not secure.  How can I be secure?  Through amassing wealth beyond all measure?  No.  And what's beyond all measure?  That's a sickness. That's a trap.  There is no measure. Only greed.  How can we act? 
I've got to get Ray to O'Hare...  Come on, let's hustle...  John!  Call American Express in Pittsburgh for Mr. Morton, will you, tell them he's on the one o'clock. 
When did you write the check?
I told you.
Tell me again.  Your wife.
No.  She told me "right now."
She told me I have to.
The "deal," forget the deal. Forget the deal, you've got something on your mind, Jim, what is it?
You have a mean streak in you, Ricky, you know that...?
Your farewell to the troops?
They didn't get my contracts.
The...
Then I'm over the fucking top and you owe me a Cadillac.
If you don't want it, give it back.
Three.
Mr. Lingk.  James Lingk.  Your contract went out.  Nothing to...
John...
I know.  How long will you be gone?
I was taller than you when I was fourteen.
Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.
That's right.
But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.
Oh yes, the very best.
 You know his friends...real animals. And his connections with the police. Sure he'd like us to tell him our plans so he can set us up for the cops and earn their gratitude. Then they would owe him a favor; that's how he operates.  We'll have to pay.  Three hundred, are we agreed?
Connie.
Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance with me.
Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
Mike, what can I do, she's a hysterical woman...
You would risk your life for strangers?
The child cannot harm you.
 My two friends have my share of the money.  I'll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler.
Get a good night's sleep.  We got a new suit, new shirt, new tie, and I'm going to shave you myself. Tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow Americans.
That's what I'm here to talk to your brother about.  What's with him, I got to get a letter of introduction to have a 'sitdown'?
Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?
For you, she is beautiful.  For me, there is only my wife!
 And he agreed?
Within the compound will be fine.
Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat.  But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with.
Okay, just hear me out.  What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed?  What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what?  And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?  What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?
He's not the same as when I met him.
It's as though he blames me for the ground the family lost when I was Consigliere to Sonny.
Connie's outside.
But if you're wrong...
A little care he can ride in with an electric motor.
I asked about Fredo?
Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby.
It was a boy.
I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If there's anything certain; certain in life; if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill...  ANYBODY.  But perhaps your relucatance is because you've come to tell me that you're moving your family to Vegas, that you've been offered the Vice-Presidency of the Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't you going to tell me at all?
Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?
He's going to try Panama...
Yeah, but don't worry.
Yeah, but only the rich guys.  The little guys got knocked off.  If they got arrested and executed, all their estate went to the Emperor. If they just went home and killed themselves, up front, nothing happened.
We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out.
I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today.  It was bad timing... but it couldn't be helped.
In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
Get out of my hotel.
There are still things I have to do.
However I can help you...
Then it's done.  I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
We're making a big investment in Cuba.  That's my only concern.
Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
Why...the Rosato Brothers.
Okay.  You know he doesn't have that kind of money.
That is not true.  I own some stock in some of the hotels, but only very small amounts.  I also own some American Telephone and IBM stock.
When do we talk?
They feel cheated.
Michael, you're sitting up here in the Sierra Mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way I run my family.
The Rosatos are running crazy; taking hostages, spitting in my face, because they're backed by the Jew in Miami.
You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
I didn't want you to know I was coming.  You heard what happened in my home?
Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I have your loyalty?
I know.
I trust these men with my life. They are my right arms; I cannot insult them by sending them away.
We worked it all out beforehand.
We want Brooklyn one hundred percent.  No more taxes to you.  We want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own.  Then we can act on all internal matters without talking.  Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him.
I told her I would speak to you, that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding. She has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble, so why shouldn't she stay.  As one Italian to another, I ask you the favor.
What was that?
Not anymore you don't.  Doll.
The Master is waiting for you.
What're you talking about?
Yeah, I'm a good man.  Something make you think I'm not?
You will not hurt him?
The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch.  I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I ask.
Of course.  I am married still.
Well...no, not really --
What did she mean by going flooey?
What was wrong?
But expressively broken.  How did it happen?
You mean -- you really want to draw me?
And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
Your family ate dripping?
All right, I guess.
Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
I'll pay our going rate.  Plus what you'd get if you did the hedges.
All righty.  I understand.
Not me.
There's no people like you in my crowd.
I don't get it.  First you creep me out with homo shit.  Then you hit me with war stories.  And now you're upset because I listen? What do you want?
I don't hear anything.
Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place.
Neither of us really belongs here.
Good.  Let's get dry.
Very sporting of you, Clayton.
-- that I was a Marine.  Which is true.  You filled in the rest.
The Great War?
A very lucky thing indeed.
Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
I didn't have the guts for it.
I don't remember that one.
You're planning a trip?
Oh no, my friend.  It's digging itself up.  There is nothing in the here and now to take my mind off it.  All my diversions have abandoned me.  Parties.  Reading. Painting.  Work.  Love.  All gone to me now.
Oh, but you have.  You undressed for me.  I kissed you.  I even touched your prick.  How will you be able to live with yourself?
Did I hurt you?
If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie.  See if his name's on it.  How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie?
I was, until last night.  Publicity asked me to fly Miss Taylor in for today's reception.
Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.
Oh no, my dear.  You look absolutely amazing.  There's no way I can compete with you.  The scene is yours.
In the sequel, James, two lady scientists should make a monster. And our monster would be Gary Cooper.
Boris?  Do I look a fright?
I am not forgetting your last brief chat.
Don't be silly, Hanna.  He's a very proper actor.  And the dullest fellow imaginable.
No, Hanna.  My heart isn't that black.
Of course.  How is the old boy these days?
It must be up in your old room.  I will look.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
Righto.  Let me see.
Me, too. Every time I walk...
I knew you'd say that.
Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ...
You know my back -
A little family emergency --
Yes, Kip. Short for Kipling. Named for the English writer of stories about India ... He bites into his pear ... Memphis says nothing, waits ...
Something like that -
Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
Needs brightening ...
What for?
Yeah.
Yeah?
No. The needy. Us. Cos we need this car!
And there she is --
That's a good one, Donny...
It ain't what you'd call a "good sign"
What time of year?
You've been pre-booked...
We'll take it...
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
Damn crooks is everywhere --
Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?
Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...
Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ?
Something like that -
You're kind of cultivating a new look.
Yeah --
You?
I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll move to the country. Open a fruit stand...
That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...
That's a good attitude, Kip. For everything but stealing cars ...
I know. I've missed you, too
You boost her -- ?
Move over ...
Shocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done. I've never actually paid for a car. I want to see what it feels like
We're going shopping -- !
DO IT! NOW -- !
A distinction worth noting ...
Hey -
The right side of the engine is running richer than the left. And the scope isn't showing shit... I dunno...
She was the only "Annie" you could find?
She was so great, why'd you leave her?
I think so... They're just... So ...
The alarms go off ...
I do ... I cut "em...
Tell me...
Ten points for our fearless leader ... Sway, how 'bout giving us the honor of the Bill Bixby trifecta -- ?
Who's "Eleanor?"
She soars -
I can tell you who's gonna be on duty tonight. I can tell you how much gas they're using monthly. I can tell you how they used to spend that annoying half-hour between "FRIENDS" and "SEINFELD"...
Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man ...
There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?
Not --
Oooh, ain't you the lucky duck --
Look at Jeannie's kid.
Son of a bitch. Get over here.
No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.
Why would I get into that?
You're only home early because we got you a job, right? And I don't need any heat. You understand?
Nods again.
Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
I thought you were going to stand me up. You looked bored. You didn't say anything. What did you expect. Tommy was all over me. Right?
The bag with the envelopes.
That again.
I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
Let her carry this shit inside.
With what?
But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.
Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.
I flushed it down the toilet.
Jimmy, come on. Fuck 'em. Don't give them the satisfaction.
Right away I knew he didn't want them. I knew I was going to get stuck for the money. I only bought the damn guns because he wanted them. And now, he didn't want them. I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was so pissed he didn't even say goodbye.
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
I gotta go home and get my hat.
Okay?
What can I do? If I could do something, don't you think I would?
Watch what happens.
I don't know, we'll fuck up some smart kids.  You'd prob'ly fit right in.
No, and we got four of 'em.
Probation, counselin', few days a week.
What do I look like, Al Cowlins?  You want to take my car, drop her off?
She went to Medical school in California.
Let me tell you what I do know. Every day I come by to pick you up, and we go out drinkin' or whatever and we have a few laughs. But you know what the best part of my day is? The ten seconds before I knock on the door 'cause I let myself think I might get there, and you'd be gone. I'd knock on the door and you wouldn't be there. You just left.
Yeah, I figured now that you got your big job over in Cambridge, you needed some way to get over there and I knew I wasn't gonna drive you every day...
Yah, it's not a bad school...
Good.
Is this a bad time?
You caught that, huh?
She's not stupid.
Shut up.
I'm Irish.
Guy's been up my ass for two years about a fuckin' job. I had to let him help with the car.
Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that it was. I remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch.
It's touching me.
You don't have to be nervous, Will.
With a Ramses graph on the binary tree--
No, no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. TERRY I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.
What're you doing?
I'm sorry.
What're those?
Okay. How?
It's right.  Take it home with you.
I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. So I sent my cheif negotiator.
Will, on your own time, you can do what you like. When I set up a meeting, with my associates, and you don't show up it reflects poorly on me.
Sam called me. From Tri-tech. He says you start working for them next week.
Thank you, Will. I'll do that.
Uh-oh.
No. LAMBEAU Okay thank you, Timmy.
--That's right, Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England.
I been here a couple years.
That's great, Gerry, that there's interest-- But I'm not sure he's ready for that.
Well, you're the only one.
Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor? Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most!
Oh, that's nice--
I don't blame you! It's not about that! It's about the boy! 'Cause he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him-- I won't see you make him feel like a failure too!
You should come. I'll buy you a drink.
Yeah, Morgan. It's a real rarity that we'd be out drinkin'.
I could work the pit maybe, but I could never drive like Dale Ernhart--
C'mon, I read your book. I talked to you. It's just something I know to be true.
You're getting defensive...Henry. And hey, cheif--tell the wife, at least. Christ, set her free.
Have you read all these books, Will?
Maybe you married the wrong woman.
Fine.
What? Do I wonder if I'd be better off if I never met my wife?
You're kiddin' me.
I guess.
But you can't give back to them, Will.
Don't give me you line of shit.
Look at me. What do you want to do?
Look, a lot of that stuff goes back a long way.  And it's between me and him and it has nothing to do with you.
I know.
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.
It's not...
Here's my number.
What?
The caramel thing is my pick-up line.
Okay, you got me. It's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser who got drunk and wouldn't leave you alone all night.
Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels.
Hey, I spent all my money on those caramels.
You should have called. I have an "O- chem" lab due tomorrow and it's impossible.  It's not an excuse dummy. I want to go out with you. But look:
All right, all right. We'll go.
Sometime. I don't know. Next week.
Why is it important to you? If I inherited all that money, the only thing important to me would be workin' on my swing.
Nobody does organic chemistry for "fun." It's unnecessary. Especially for someone like you.
No.
I can't go out to California.
One, because I have a job here and two because I live here--
Then what are you afraid of?
Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--
Is that what you think--
You don't want to hear that I got cigarettes put out on me when I was a little kid. That this isn't surgery
Goodbye.
We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.
Well, we ain't out a it yet.
We got to get outa here right away. Ever'body here? Where's Uncle John?
Gallon or two?
Women?
Joad. Tom Joad.
We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
*You* find out, I can't.
That cut you got?
Have a little snort?
I been in the penitentiary for four years. 
Excuse me for asking.
I'll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the Holy Sperit I ever seen. He go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time. Fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. Well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. They was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' I give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that.
Casy! What you doin' here?
Want to work, do you?
Sure do.
Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
*Used* to be your land. B'longs to the comp'ny now.
Just a few miles. I'd a walked her if my dogs wasn't pooped out.
Why don't you get to it, buddy?
You been acrost?
Yes, ma'am.
And can't nobody *make* me go, either! Ain't nobody here *man* enough to make me! I'm a-stayin'.
Got any plants?
Well, you just turn around and walk the other way.
I'll walk back.
Okay. I be back a little later.
An' you won't let nobody touch me?
Go get Tom an' Al.  I dunno what to do. I got to feed the fambly. What'm I gonna do with these here?
Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--
You'll *what*?... Come on, Pa. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it.
Pa! Shh!
It sure is hell jus' tryin' to get enough to eat.
Thank God. I--I don't want no mean son 
I was afraid they'd stop us an' wouldn't let us cross. But I tol' Granma. I tol' her when she was dyin'. I tol' her the fambly had ta get acrost. I tol' her we couldn't take no chances on bein' stopped.
On a gallon a gas?  Let's set up the tent. Maybe I can fix us up some stew.
I know, Ma. I'm a tryin'. If it was the law they was workin' with, we could take it. But it *ain't* the law. They're workin' away at our spirits. They're tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl. They're workin' on our decency.
Looks like you done it.
They know he got hit in the face.
Okay, Ma. I shouldn't, though. I know I shouldn't. But okay.
Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
I don't understan' it, Tom.
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
Brother, I don't know. If I did I'd tell you. But I just don't know *who's* to blame!
Well, I'm right here to tell you, mister, ain't *nobody* going to push me off *my* land! Grampa took up this land seventy years ago. My pa was born here. We was *all* born on it, and some of us got killed on it, and some died on it. And that's what makes it ourn--bein' born on it, and workin' it, and dyin' on it--and not no piece of paper with writin' on it! So just come on and try to push me off!
Why, she wasn't no more'n a kid when I went up.
Ain't no whisky, is they?
How's Granma since we got her in the tent?
Ain't gonna get outa han'.
You do not.
Wonderful.
So, what are you doing now?
I sell BMW's. What do you do?
A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
That's part of it.
Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
I'll think about it.
Yes.
I'll just help myself to a cocktail.
No.
Get the fuck outta here.
I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.
Other people can't.
You know where I live?
We're both professionals, Oatman.
I do. Some guys can't adjust to it; they can't handle it.
Like a union?
No harm no foul.
Those all seem kind of related...
I guess.
If he does our job, he's our job.
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
And not show it to me. Ever again.
Mmm, not really. But you're gonna love this one.
I'll do it tomorrow.
It's fine.
What's a revival tent?
Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
No. You drove us here.
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
To shoot you. Correct.
Ma'am, I'm very sorry about your problems and I appreciate what your daughter must be going through, but I'm afraid you've misunderstood whatever it is you read. I don't do that sort of thing.
Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
You were married to a woman in Chicago?
Well, I, uh... you didn't...
A jogger, huh?
Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.
I can handle it!
You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...
He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.
Yeah.
Son?
That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.
Fine!
Grace, I put it on the table near your --
I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
Yeah?
Fine.
You don't.
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
Hi.
Why? There's no food in the house?
Yeah, you know everything!!
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
Yes. We're suing.
All right. Speak to you then.
She was in pretty bad shape. They've done a C.A.T. Scan -- she has some hemorrhaging...
We're very lucky.
Doing what?
Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.
I'm not pretending anything!
I know. We miss you too.
Oh well... branding will do that to you.
Yeah, what?
Tubab means white man.
Mmm. I made good time.  Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.
I don't know. Let's just go and... we'll see...
Well, I know Peterson's. Old place is as good as falling down around your ears.
Would you mind if I did? I'd like to talk to him.
Always did. I think she favored him a little. You tend to when you have more than one, even though you love 'em all the same.
Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there.
Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
Yes, it does.
He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land.
Oh God, Annie, I'm so sorry. I... I know you're being hit with a low now, I don't want to take too much of your time but I have to talk to you about Pilgrim.
Ain't brain surgery.
Sure. As long as she don't mind.
Yeah.
You know, you're a good kid.
Uh, I'm Tom Booker. Your mother around?
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
Mmm. An editor.
Not to me. Either you want to or you don't.
Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
Not a question of if you can -- you are. Just keep your eyes on the road and your foot on the pedal and the rest will take care of yourself.
We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
I thought your mom's coming up?
So?
No, wait, it just goes... "he said he liked to do-"...
I wouldn't know what to do if you were on time.
Oh-oh... Maybe I better get back in the truck.
About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders?
Well... Dale... you know, a lot of this stuff... it just... nuts and bolts.
You think it's cool?
Alright sir.
Hack the Planet!
How are you going to take care of the cops?
Shh!
Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
That's far out!
Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The big iron?
Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade?  Right, Dade?!
I told you, I don't play well with others.
You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
No.
Burn!
You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
You what?
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
Alright, let's boot up.
What?
Dreams?
Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers?
Uhhhmm...
Sorry, I can't help you, okay?
However, we have come to believe that one Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus. He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We want you to help us find it.
We caught 'em.
The rabbit is in the administration system.
Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute, listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file from...
Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.
No one believes the guilty. Besides, by the time they realize the truth, we'll be long gone with all of our money.
Nonono, thank YOU!
Okay, I guess. I'll call you later.
What does that mean?
Get up there Rachel!
Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.
You know damn well about what.  You let them take it out of here.
For Christ sakes. Spare me the speech. I've listened to it for a decade.  The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient, and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law.
I can see this is useless.
You dumb son of a bitch, you said you saw Myers.
I can't sleep.
What is this? Four nights in a row?  You going for a record here?  The seven year olds insomniacs hall of fame?
Do you love me Rachel?
Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age.  I bet you didn't know that.
Double scoops?
In a second.
Real soon, Jamie. Now shh.
I can't.
Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.
You won't come on too strong.
Its not over yet.
Do you?
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
If you'd seen that police station you wouldn't even ask.
Got it Ben.
Evil.
What?
The only things missing were some Halloween masks, rope, a set of knives. What does that sound like to you?
Look where?
Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
Bye.
Probably Mister Riddle.
If you watch her, I'll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning.
Want a beer?
Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
Where?
Three blocks down. Get in the car and go up that other street and then back down here. I'm going up the block.
After the Jack-O-Lantern.
No...
The bogyman!
We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
What is it, Laurie?
It's the bogyman, isn't it?
Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?
Will you get her for me?
I've given them his profile.
I'm wasting time.
Only minimum security.
It means... I see.
Mm-mm!
I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
Great.
Look at this.
If...well, if we took the, if we took Fifth, then-then-then we'd get to your house first, yeah?
Look, it's just an evening at the opera.  Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting?
No, the funniest show that Mickey and I ever did was the one we won the Emmy for.
Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
I cry at the opera.
I'm an architect.
They fit right in together.  And your eye goes along, lulled into complacency, and then...
Fast.
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
Yes, a little dizziness, and I think, I think I'm developing a hearing loss in my right ear  ...or my left ear, my, my left...oh, n-n-n-no.  No, I'm sorry.  It was my right, my right, my right or my left ear.
The hospital?  What kind of tests?
Could you--
...ex-husband on the street the other day.
Yes, I do.
Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time.  I know you would.
And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve.  It reminded me of you.
Bye.
Oh, speaking of records...I bought that Mozart Trio you recommended...
Yeah.
What do you expect me to say?
Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.
But-but, but how about you?  Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?
W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
Yes, but you, you do care about me.
No.
Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!
Why not?
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
I want one with you.
What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes?  I-I-I am disenchanted.  I am in love with someone else.
Oh, honey!
How can we be happy?
Based on what?  You never even see him.
You've been with someone!
Jesus...Jesus!
Tch, oh, what do you get out of me, anyway?  I mean...  it's not sexual anymore.  It's certainly not intellectual.  I mean, you're so superior to me in every way that--
Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.
I--How was I to know?!  Everyone was pointing back here.
I think they're fantastic.
Oh, no!  I mean, everyone thinks things like that.
Yeah?
Oh!
I like him.  I think he's a sweet guy.
Is there no chance?
He's the one that's made every ingenue in stock!
Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.
Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
Hannah, I know it's a lot, but my friend April and I, we have this catering idea I think's going to be great.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
When does Frederick ever come with her?
Oh, your kids are so adorable.
He's not a loser at all!
Oh, perfect!  He reminds me of Ichabod Crane.  His Adam's apple keeps jumping up and down whenever he gets excited. HANNAH  Listen.  He's a lot better than your ex-husband.  He's got a good job.  Would you light those, please? He's-he's-he's not a dope addict or anything.
Well, how about this?
Oh, yeah. 
Tch, well, I sing!  For Chrissake, Hannah, you heard me sing!
Yeah, although it's put an end to the Stanislavski Catering Company. Which is why I have to speak to you. And...  you're gonna get impatient, but...I have to borrow some more money. 
Yeah, that's clerical.
What's the matter?
Oh, wow!  I don't want to have this conversation.  I didn't do anything wrong.
No, he hasn't.  If I offended you, I'm sorry.
I can't hear you.  I can't hear anything.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna lose hearing in my ear!  I'm--
I remember you.
Oh, that's putting it mildly.  We did everything but exchange gunshots.
I'm okay.
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
Really?
This is it.  Yeah.  This is really-- HOLLY  Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it?  Something...that I wrote?
You have.
I'm not anymore.  I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year.
You're kidding me.
I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?
Oh, I'm fine.
Do you?  I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?
Hi.
You know, I was talking with your father before...and I was telling him that  it's ironic.  I-I used to always have Thanksgiving with Hannah...and I never thought  that I could love anybody else.  And here it is, years later and I'm married to you  and completely in love with you.  The heart is a very, very resilient little muscle.  It really is.  I...  It'd made a great story, I think. A guy marries one sister...  doesn't work out...  many years later...  he winds up  married to the other sister.  It's, you know, it's a...
...which I did not get.
I just want a salad.  You really think I'm a loser, don't you?
Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
I want to talk to you about your <u>salary</u>. Because I can't...
If you'll come down the street I will make you a cup of coffee.
It wasn't my day.
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
I'd prefer it...  But it's just a vacant exercise.
No, you're wrong about Verger.
Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.
COULD I GET A <u>DRINK</u>,  N'I don't <u>care</u>, you see, what all they got me doin, for I'd rather be doin' <u>makework</u>, than be doin' <u>pub'l'relations</u> with THE DIRTY DOZEN, one <u>Hispanic</u>, one <u>Librarian</u>, one <u>Jew</u>, and One from Column A, and One from Column...  Thank you.
You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....
You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
...the whole world's out to get you...
I know her by the Back.
...I have never met a man who was so well beloved.
...he was <u>wealthy</u>...
You spend the afternoon in Bed?
Have the child taken to bed.
I've never heard that he...
He is...?
No, no, of course not.
Mmm...

N'I'll tell you <u>what</u>, after he's got his jollies, ten, f'teen minutes, I'll come down here, give you a shotta <u>this</u>  stop your heart, an that's <u>you</u> done, an there's an <u>end</u> to it.

Whatsay we call your banker now, tell him a <u>code</u>... move that money to me, he <u>confirms</u> it, and I fix you up Right Now...  Whatsay?
Come on, Doctor, <u>then</u> you can sleep...
You seen John Brigham...?
And how did she get close enough to disarm you?
I think its meaning is clear.
One moment, I'm not done with you...  Give him the file...
Gonna be fine.  You ask your momma.
And how do we account for the interest of such a charming man, an interest in Torture?
I never met him.  I knew him only from his writings.
I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...
It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel?
I've left my <u>program</u>...
Yes, of course, and we'll <u>collect</u> them. I won't be a minute...
She my foster.
No. 
...who say...?
They <u>will</u>, sir.  We <u>train</u> them, to the figurine, <u>eventually</u>, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...
Is it necessary to know?
<u>Perhaps</u>... shall we <u>see</u>...?
...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...
Why should <u>you</u> care?
<u>Yes</u>.
Oh baby, oh baby....
...not to turn around.
I'll tell you what:  I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota. 
Mr. Crawford asked my opinion.  Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
Cause I'm tired, cleaning up after you.  Why dontcha gimme the gun?
And why should we believe you?
No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
Well, that's you see, what I am, kind and feeling.
Or clear your windshield with it.
I din't solve it, I didn't '<u>solve it</u>'.  I just sat a <u>dance</u> out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  <u>Facts</u>, close the case, cavalier.
...no.
Your father.  It is not <u>they</u>, who...
...would you use a small word?
But... but....but.... you're <u>right</u>.  I used it.  To <u>bargain</u>.  For her <u>sympathy</u>...  I <u>used</u> it--to "whore myself out"-- 
Yes.
I want to do something <u>positive</u>...
And you have been <u>dreaming</u>... dreaming about this Hat, and...
And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
Large resources, Starling, which I prefer to devote elsewhere....
Adam. Dollface. We had a physical relationship that served a purpose and now...
I was pretty confident that I was going to blow it with Talia, but I must say, I outdid myself.
You are the prince of the darkness.
Oh thanks, it was nothing...
You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it...
I hope so...
Why am I so--That's new--The way I figure it is if I can get through to just one camper...then I'm a pretty incompetent counselor.                                           ] Don't get caught. I'll deny                                 ] everything.                                                 ]
Goodnight, Jasper.
Goodnight.
That would be a No.
"or you're going to get it?" Wow, first week of camp. Promise me you won't try moving so fast with Wichita.
Yeah, an insane female gynecologist! Hayley, don't listen to her.
Talia, just because you happen to be Jewish, doesn't mean you can make fun of someone desecrating the Lord's body...
I gotta...I gotta go do a "bunk check." Or some fucking thing.
Yeah. I guess I do.
I think your condescension is even better.
It's okay, there's a lot of things I don't believe in...
I was thinking...if we could mesh my way of thinking with your way                            ] of thinking, we could really do some                        ] great counseling.

It's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask "What's your major?" I hate that.
Hey, don't run away now.
Let's do it on the coats. It'll be excellent.
In my heart, Heather's still alive.
What are you talking about? She hated you! You hated her!  What are you smiling at?
Because you're an idiot.
Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks.
Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?
Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.
Oh God Veronica, my afterlife is s-o-o boring. If I have to sing "Kumbaya" one more time...
I made your favorite. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
Color me nauseous.
Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but...
Because I can be! The same fucking cheek, goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick? Do you think, do you really think, if Betty Finn's fairy godmother made <u>her</u> Cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? No way! Uh-Uh!
Give it up girl!
Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
So did you call people to tell them how to get to the studio tonight?
Sure.
I've been moved around all my life; Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any town, any time, I can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane.
Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.
Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect?
Good plan.
And your worst enemy.
Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
You're probably right..."People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody understood I had feelings too."
Our love is God. Let's get a Slurpee.
Uh well hey, let's take a look at the homosexual artifacts I dug up. Now, prepare to be a little disappointed.
Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.
Oh, you're so smart. How about a little heterosexuality before we go?
I did not want them <u>dead</u>.
Did to.
She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
Don't <u>even</u> talk about that stuff!
I don't get it! You were wrong! I was right! Strength, damnit! Come back!
Shit, we're seniors, Ram. Too old for that crap. Let's give him a scare though.
What did your <u>boyfriend</u> say when you told him you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio?
Great pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the party tonight.
Superb.
I'm lost. You don't get enough attention, you get too much attention. Which is it? Where are your shoes?
I work at Dennis Brothers Fish Supply.
playfully shoves his hand away.
Look who I've found!
pulls his coat on. HONORA gives him a peck cheek.
whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
Who cares!
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
stands and walks toward the door.
Love, you can still write to each other.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
This . . .
John has fallen in love with me!
You mean travel by ourselves?
I can try my father's safe. I'm sure I can get the keys to his office.
That's great! We'll have the fare in no time!
Mummy!
All right, then.
You need to get better first Trevor. Way better.  It's okay to miss somebody. It's okay to still love someone after they're gone. But you've got to quit blaming yourself okay...? Okay?
I miss her. I miss my wife.
Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.
You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death.
Gwen.
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life. And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o'clock get ready for bed. 
Where's Allison?
Zero's a number right?
Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
Uh... eighty two?
This isn't happening.
Where's my wife?
It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.
And as far as hiding a body goes? I find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess. It's absolutely preposterous. Now I'm not saying I don't believe you, I'm....ambiguous. There's quite alot of money behind all this.
Two.
Can you follow them?
Wow. Let's see. So many sins so little time. For starters I was responsible for the death my wife who by the way was carrying my unborn child. That was so I could collect her eight million dollar estate. I think I killed several women I was having mindless sex with behind her back.
But that's what I need. To be sure... to be absolutely sure...
Jeez it's getting awful crowded in there.
I surrender...
Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
Hey even if it is more power to ya.  Alrighty then. Have a good time.
Well now there's a compliment.
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?
Come on, John, don't be an asshole. I don't like heights.
--but there's a lot of it still left, uh, Bernie.  Almost half.
On the deposition for the jUdge, Bernie... I mean there's no way I can promise anything.  I can't tell him what we're up to...
That's good enough for me.  You better take that "letter" there and get rid of it.
Yeah, and with me it was like I was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine.
Involved!  Christ!  She attached my goddamn paycheck!  Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?  You know what I mean.  Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...
You mean John Bubber?
You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?
You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie?
I...
Bill, I got some legal problems and I...
Me!
Lie, you mean...
I'm working on that.  It's just I got some business problems and... whatsa matter?
You... you think I saved your... life.  I can't take advantage....
Vietnam!
I just remembered.  You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing.
This guy LaPlante won an award?
LaPlante!
And sold it to Mister LaPlante, the fence, who's now trying to blackmail poor John.
You just can't bear the idea of good news.
You're sitting on your ticket.
It's a wonderful piece.  Emotional. I love it.
The Presidency.  The public loves him.
The "unknown hero."  They found his shoe right beside the plane crash.
Hello, Mister Wallace.
Half the time he don't answer even if he's home.  Know why?  'Cause he don't want no bill collectors to find him.  I don't mean to be judgmental, but he's a scumbag. He don't have no friends.  Who's gonna like a creep like LaPlante? I was doin' him a favor on the TV outta kindness, and he screwed me. You know what color skin you get on my set, Miss Gayley?  Purple! That's what color skin you got on the tee vee LaPlante sells me!
He's pretty... remarkable.
Who?
Safety?
They're great with kids.  They love 'em.  They eat 'em up.  I'm kidding.
I'm Bernard, by the way.  Those are cool Reeboks, Neil.  They're real new, aren't they?
Wife, girlfriend or mother?
-- hospital.
As long as you keep remembering why.
On the contrary -- this is tremendous.  I mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and I'm not saying we should, you know, <u>declare</u> ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty --
Who doesn't?
Well, you'll just have to <u>make</u> her understand.
Yeah, that was easy.
It is tomorrow.
Bye, Neil!
I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
I could take a cab on the way home.
Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
Honey, I'm sorry, I think the vacation will be a good break for both of us.  You'll see.
C'mon.
There might be some extras in the garage.
I'm <u>fired</u>.  I'm unemployed.  Is that your idea of negotiating from a position of strength?  Clearly any potential employers have been warned to back off!
Someone blew the whistle.  Someone hates me.
There's always an excuse, isn't there?
No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
Sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment.
Isn't it?
What about cable?
Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?
And I can't help having a cold.
No.
No man!  <u>Go to your room</u>.
Parker.  We found him knocked out in the can.
What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
Talk to me about what?
What is it?
We don't have any proof of that.
It's circumstantial.
That's what I figured.  Well, I have a little home coming present for you.
Central Park.
And Brenda?
Caution shows wisdom.
It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.
That's all?
And what do you think you will find in another land?
I do not know.  I pray that I shall never have to raise my sword against one that I call friend.
Living.  Remember?
I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
The only thing you can do.  You must end it.
I stood up first.
Can you really tell from doing that?
Where do you go when your mind drifts?
I'm leaving in the morning.
Then take me with you.
To talk to you.
If it's good advice.
What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?
About what?
Meet me Tratino's at nine.
Why don't you tell me.
If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall.
And the other one -- he is like you?
He will not stop until it is over.
Conner?
What's that next to him?
The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.
And I you.  Go now.  Let me walk to heavens door alone.
Why?
I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--
Don't shout, Larry.  I'm three feet away.
I will, Chief.  Absolutely.
The cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in Beverly Hills.  The phone company shows no unusual --
Keep trying.
I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan.
If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You should let them know.
Jesus, first Mars, now you.  You two need anti-depressants.
What are you talking about?
They're fine.
We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you.
I'll give you these people.
Okay.
If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
I'm getting a doctor!
Find something:  Extension cords, rope, wire--we'll have to tie them tight.
Fuckin' A.
Jesus, get upstairs and find out!  If he took those kids, we're fucked!
You fucked up, Glen.
An hour, tops.  Might be sooner.
Canyon Country.
I also have a couple of million in cash. Call Sonny Benza.  Ask if I can keep it.
You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
We'll see you in a couple of hours.
Be quiet!  Listen!
Yes.
Holster your guns!
Get in the car.  <u>Now</u>.
York Estates.  Four-five-five Castle Way. Anders and Jorgenson are on the way.
He didn't say.
Then we don't know if she's part of this or not.  Mickey, you up?
Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a crime scene like that.  Put a unit out there.
They might be at the house.  Keep trying and let me know.  I'm going to be here a little while longer.
If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
And now I'm taking it back.  We're getting Smith out of the house.
Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!
Chief, it's Mikkelson.
I asked you my name.  You just saw my commission slip.  What's my fucking name?
Special Agent Jones.
Where's the office?
Where are you right now?
I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
No!  They're right here --
Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.
What do you want?
These guys are going to take hold of you. Don't freak out.  It's for your own good.
They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate.
Excuse me?
We are looking for you.
Six.
We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?
Get him a room, but tell no one he is here.  Paul will look after you.
What's happening?
They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister.
Canadian Club?
Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
I can't, I don't have the men.
The rebels have fought their way into the city. They have many Hutu prisoners.
I wish I could, Paul. Try to hold out.
The United Nations are still here.
A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
'Snatch them up and put on a war crimes trial. Lock them all away forever. No political risk, and big publicity.' That's what he said.  I thought I'd better tell you.
I'll be over.
I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
I am on a list! What list?
No whiskey, no spirits. Your rich cockroaches at the hotel, they will have to do without their scotch. Anyway, I have bled that cow enough Paul.
Were not going outside the hotel grounds unless we have an armored car. That's the ground rules.
Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
Of course.
Take it for Christ sake. I wish it was a fucking aeroplane.
We must do something.
Murdered! By whom?
No, no.
You cannot go alone.
I'm not going alone. I'll take Gregoire with me. He's a good Hutu, and he wants to impress me now.
To be closer. So that I could marry you.
What does it matter.
Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there.
Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit.
I can give you many political answers Paul but the truth is that Africa is not worth a single vote to all of them: French, British, Americans.
It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.
He has taken the presidential suite.
Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it.
Can I help you?
-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
How much more do they need than your death at his hands?
And how the hell are we going to do that?
Name's Pritchett. Watson Pritchett. I own the house, my father built it. And now I just need to get you into it. So...
Oh dear.
C'mon.
A very, very scary game. But then look at the bright side: if there's only one of you still upright at dawn, you'll be leaving here with five million dollars in your pocket.
You'll never know 'til you walk through that door!
-- yeah, we did that --
I thought she was dead. For sure.
Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
For chrissake give me a hand!
You've got your own TV show?
Cheer up: before the night's through, I'm sure one of us'll get hacked to pieces by somebody or something.
I hope not.
Eddie Moses, Communications Attache -- which translated from ancient bullshit means: I work for a Messenger service.
Oh. You think this is a request. Well, think again. I'm telling you: "Haunted Hill" is exactly where we're having my party this year. You'll find the guest list on your desk by the time you get back --
Then who are they?
You tell me. I don't know how you managed to hack into my Mac, but: bravo.
Only one way I can think of, Sweetheart.
-- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new.
-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
Absolutely. No cheap thrills. A genuine Journey To The Brink Of Madness.
-- even if I give you a million as well?
I think, Pritchett, we've got a situation here that even you can't explain away as "ghosts." This is ice- cold homicide by person -- or persons --
I am.
Very good. Well, I think I can say with complete honesty: I've never heard of any of you.
I never saw you --
Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price.
-- it wasn't me.
It better be -- he still owes me $25 grand for renting the place for the night! Here, let's get you some illumination so you can make your way safely!
This? This is nothing. You've only been dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you're tinkering with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out... One of you will release it... Not meaning to, of course... then...  ...Bye, bye, Miss American Pie...
Excuse me?
Oh, dear.
Colleen.
The style of dress on the girl... it coincides with the era Marion Foster killed herself.  Who else could have gone in there and done something like that?
There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university.  I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.
I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.
So was I.  The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not.
There's no need to be.
By freeing them.
The knife destroys the evil and saves the soul of the possessed.
Yes, we'll be leaving soon.
That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did.  Lived here my whole life.
Well, that all depends.
Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
Well what power lines, Will?  Where?  Maybe we should call someone about it.
No...  NO!
What's happening!
We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.
It was a shame.
The blood of a woman is birth, life. It is part of the ceremony. Seamus offers up the pin - Maura waits a beat, then takes it -
I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
I wish I had an answer.  Evil is powerful, more so every day it seems.  But I believe the worst for you and for this house is behind us.
Well what is it!
And I believe what you say.  But this is TV.  No pictures, no story.
That is the story of my life.
Correct.  The fields of France.  And many dead flowers ... Oh.  Forgive me. My name was Spenser.  Elliott Spenser. Captain.
It's nothing to do with me.  I wasn't even with him.
Where?
What?
I'll do it!
I don't think so.  But it's a fascinating subject.  Did you ...
Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ...
Sure.  Just papers, photos.  Stuff nobody'd ever want.
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
You shit.  Who do you think you are?
You ... I can't fucking believe you, you bastard!  You get me in here ...
Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?
What do you want?
Well ... of course I have.  I've thought.  I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible.  You really hurt me ...
Oh, I don't ...
A girl?  Anyone I should know?
Something like that.
Because I'm tired of not understanding things.  Cops, Mafia, and butlers forcing me to bust my ass to steal something, which it turns out I really didn't steal--it's fucked up.
Get em....
It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.
As for our plan of action, anybody'd be insane to go in from the ground floor...
I'm sorry for losing it back there, but you must remember, sister, you have vows to God as well as a mission to the world.
Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...
Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand....
Oh, I must have put too much ethyl-chloride in it.
It's from the machine.  All they need is the crystal to run it and they have 2/3 of it already.  We can't let that happen.
You re not "some guy" anymore, Hudson.  Right now, you're the only guy.  Without your help, I....
Trust Leonardo....
Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking with God.  But you're a close second, tough guy.  What is that smile?
You've got a dilemma, tiger.  I think I know what's going to help you solve it.
You just might.  I'm the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it.  At the time, I was bald with a beard, no moustache, and I had a different nose, so if you don't recognize me, I won't be offended.
Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another...
Employer?  The president?
No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look. what's that up there?
Shucks.  Guess not.
Sharp.
Snappy.
We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
It's hardly the same --
No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper -- these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years --
Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion.
Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean.
I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --
Oh, it isn't your fault, Amy. You're the one person who's been standing by me through all this.
Norville, you can't trust people here like you did in Muncie...
Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --
Sez me! Amy Archer. Why is he an Idea Man -- because Hudsucker says he is? What're his ideas? Why won't they let anyone interview him?...
Yeah, well, monkey or not I'm still editor of this rag. Amy, I thought you were doing that piece on the F.B.I. -- J. Edgar Hoover: When Will He Marry?
Says who?!
You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!
Amy -- take a break. You've worked hard on this story -- heck, you broke it for us! But it's passed you by and Smith here has taken up the slack.
For instance, take a look at this sweet baby...
Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
But, buddy, you were --
-- I can't have every deadbeat on the Hudsucker payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves!
We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries! Get out of my office! Leave your uniform in the locker room!
'...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...'
No, sir.
Okay, Sid. Like I said, you're the expert, but --
-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --
Well... I'm for it...
Ah forget it, kid, ya don't have to explain to me. He's a little person. He's nothing. Like I say, ordinarily it would just be a nuisance. But it seems -- well, there was a spy in the company...
She looks in her purse...
He notices.
Thank you, Alma.
That's nonsense, Alma.
Yes, Miss Betsy.  I mean that.  The Houngan will speak to the rada drums and the drums will speak to Shango and Damballa.
I'm afraid so.
Try it -- you may have more influence than you think.
You don't believe in it?
You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
Mrs. Rand was at the Houmfort that night.  But there's nothing wrong with that.  She's gone there for years -- trying to take care of those people,  to help them.
I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell.
Is she a doctor?
It's my day off.
Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
I'd like to go now, Rand.  Would you mind taking me home?
I am not a frightened girl.
Why should you be?  My wife is a mental case.  Please keep that in mind, Miss Connell -- particularly when some of the foolish people of this island start talking to you about Zombies.
Many people thought her beautiful.
And charming?
Don't.  It will save you a great deal of trouble and other people a great  unhappiness.
Well, I had a good time up to a point.
Wesley can be very entertaining.
Yes, he can.  But I've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table --
I often do.
You didn't drive her mad.
I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort.  I thought they might cure her.
I told you.
No.  It's not just how I felt toward Jessica.  I've been cruel to even you.
That's past -- that's over and done with...
I want you to be safe, Betsy.  I want to know you're away from this place -- home again, where nothing can harm you -- nothing and no one.
Why?
Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. I'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top.
Why shouldn't she be?
So maybe you'll come too?
Good night.
You know Elena, I've been thinking--
No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --
I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.
Hell, I know. I -- I guess if you want to accuse me, you've got --  Oh hell! I've got to pick up Paul. I almost forgot.
You go dry off now.
Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you know, reading, thought I'd just catch some air. Let's eat.
See for yourself.
You think I --
Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?
We're not going anywhere.
Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
Ben, I don't think he wants us here.
Well good. Just confirming. You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.
Fine.
You know Paul, I've been thinking, maybe this is as good a time as any to have a little talk, you know, about -- well --
Uh, dad, you know I'm 16.
Birth control.
I just can't believe you could be so --
If I were a fascist I would have sent you to one of those Southern military academies a long time ago. Now get to bed.
Good night kiddo.
Yeah.
That's besides the point. The point is if I'd had any sense in me I'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that's the truth, and here it is, 1972 --
-- 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, Ben, be a man and just get it over with. I would have if I'd had the chance.
Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the IRS, and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff --
That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.
You know, it's a California thing. That scuzzy husband of hers dragged her kicking and screaming to one when they were out in L.A. you know, the men put their car keys in a bowl, and then at the end of the evening the women line up and fish them out and go home with whoever's keys they've got. Anyhow that's how she met this Rod person or whatever his name is and he's left his wife and she's packing for California. Irwin is devastated. It's so ironic.
Well, we can talk about it.
Phone's out. I hope the pipe's --
Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt.
What sort of problems are you planning exactly?
It's not a bother.
It's not like we're too busy.
Social work?
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
Well I of course flatter myself that our church is not exactly what most people would call organized religion -- at times it's the disorganization that's liberating -- and of course I've begun to minister much more in what one might call therapeutic environments, in small groups, and one on one, couples --
You're saying that Christ is the child, and --
I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --
My man, I speak to you solely as a comrade in arms offering unconditional aid. I've been giving this one a lot of thought, and I believe that the two of you together might just reach that higher ground that --
Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed.
Play with the whip.
If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot.
The Idiot.
Thanks for the advice dad.
Sure I do, you know, like your aura. That you give off.
It's beyond mere physical attraction.
Truly? Do speak.
There's a TV in the basement.
I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.
Is this Charles?
Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p.o.'d.
All my model planes.
I have to go to the bathroom.
That's the name for when you wake up and find this little pool of sticky stuff, like after a sexy dream.
Sure.
Don't worry about him...
It's all about the small stuff.  Small lies.  Small mistakes.  Small oversights. People give themselves away in a traffic violation just as much as they do in a murder case.  It's human nature.
The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.
Byrd's dead.
He would have liked that.
Anything.  It's important.
What time was that?
And something else that might interest you.
So?
You tell Buck and I'm involved whether I like it or not...
There's a guy down the hall.  Complaining about the noise.  Says he can't sleep.
Me and Hap.  A year and a half ago.  I knew the second I met Dobbs that he was guilty.  Smug, cold.  Dead eyes.  We had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it.  Nothing concrete.  Went over every inch of that apartment.
She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?
How should I know?...
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That <i>he</i> was going to take her!
Oh?
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
I didn't want to kill her, Will.
Yes, and very beautiful.
We had feared we were the only ones...
You let them do it.
Yes, cherie, of course you want more. And I'll show you how to get it. You drink from morals, my beauty, but from me? Never again.
It's bet in the beginning, lest the death takes you down with it. yes, that's it. My child. My beloved child.
Is this my birthday?
I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
The way I learn everything. By watching you.
Why does he call you that?
Why not?
And he found me with you. I ran, sickened at what I'd done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. And have been every night hereafter.
The one good lesson he taught me, Louis. Never drink from the dead.
I can't. Go away from me.
I can't bear it when you do - I would die rather than lose you Louis. I would die the way he died.
Still my beautiful child.
They are here. I know they are. Listen for something that doesn't make a sound.
He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.
And who will care for me my love, my dark angel, when you are gone?
What died tonight inside that room was not that woman. It will take her many nights to die, perhaps yeaars. What has died in that room tonight is the last vestige in me of what was human.
Why should I be?
They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy...
NO!!!!!
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
But you must know something about the meaning of it all, you must know where we come from, why we...
Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
She would sleep in my coffin, daily, curl her child's fingers round my hair as she dreamt of I know not what...
CLAUDIA!!!
And they frighten you?
I tried...
You'd have to have a lot of tape for my story. I've had a very unusual life.
We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
But I thought vampires didn't like the light.
We love it. I only wanted to prepare you.
The same way you do it. A series of simple gestures. Only I moved too fast for you to see. I'm flesh and blood, you see. But not human. I haven't been human for two hundred years.
But times were different then. I was a man at that age. The master of a large plantation just south of New Orleans...
You loved your wife, surely.
He was dead to us. We were free. That was all that mattered.
No...
Not at all. Those are our honeymoon suites.
I'd call this four spoiled city kids who wouldn't know a hurricane if it blew up their butts.  All we can do now is batten down and ride it out. If things get really bad, there's a storm shelter.
Stupid. What were you thinkng?
No.
No means yes.
But, he said he'd try.
Don't even think about it.
The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there.
Just kidding.
Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth.
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
Can't what?
Will you try...for me, please?
Oh...it's not working right. You're home early.  Did I scare you?
You don't seem fine.
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.
I'm not hiding up no tree.  I'm with her. Let's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho's butt.
Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James.
Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
No. Yes?
Well, there's some flaws in her...
No. I shot him.
Cool.
See, it's not a macho thing. It's about equilibrium in your inner ear. You could've used a patch, but it's too late now. Get used to it.  Some folks just can't sail.
How's the water?
Hey -- shut up, okay?
Julie? Wanna tell us what is going on here?
I'll go find him.
In case you do so, would you --
All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
Very well. I'll wager a dinner.
I must meet him with laughter - with songs and laughter -- to show him I am not afraid --
This was once a cemetery.
I don't know now without my father.
I do not know him, but I have seen him.
That should decide it or you --
Miss Wollsten!
Mr. Davis seems a good prospect young handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -
Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
Her name is Thea?
Damn me, if I know. She's become so much a member of our household I never think of her by any name but Thea -- she has a last name --
Miss Wollsten - my secretary, she'd know.
I'll only go as far as the shore and wait for you.
I know all you are going to say -I have been saying it to myself, but the thought will not leave my mind. She resembles my wife -there is something about her the way she moves  the way she turns her head.
It is not necessary to understand. We are leaving and I am thankful.
You see? Thea believes it, too!
The General threatened me.
For a moment, when he looked at me so sadly, I felt that I had wronged him. But then --
I can't do that. These families have children.
Go through with what?
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
I said I wish I'd never been born.
Well, maybe I left the car up at Martini's. Well, come on, Gabriel.
You're nobody. You have no identity.
Zuzu's petals.
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
Where is she?
Well, keep your eyes open. See the town?
If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
That's the kid.
Splendid! Is he sick?
Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.
I know that girl!
Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together.
I know  I know, but you just go to sleep, and then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden.
Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
I see, a flying carpet, huh? I don't suppose you'd like this old second-hand job, would you?
The last time he come in here. You hear that, Nick?
Hmmmm . . .
Nice girl, Mary.
Hmmmm . . .
Well then, how do you know?
Now, if you'll just point me in the right direction . . . This direction?  Good night, Mrs. Bailey.
No.
No.
Ummmm . . .
Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
He's pretty young for that job.
Oh, now, Pop, I couldn't. I couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office.
I hope it works.
What's that?
Hello, Violet.
Where are you going?
Huh?
I know, but . . .
Every cent of it, and it still was less than we owe.
Holy mackerel!
The whole town's gone crazy.
Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
They're not my children.
Well, what about the Building and Loan?
What is it  a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
I don't like coconuts.
Uh-uh. That was a little girl named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.
You may kiss my hand.
Well, not just one wish. A whole hatful, Mary. I know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that. I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm going to see the world. Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum. Then I'm coming back here and go to college and see what they know . . . and then I'm going to build things. I'm gonna build air fields. I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. I'm gonna build bridges a mile long . . .
I didn't tell anybody. I just went for a walk and happened to be passing by . . .
It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.
Well, then, sit down.
What is it, a sore throat or what?
What plates?
Soon, dark eyes, soon.
But of course.
What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?
I can't help it  it sticks in my mind.
Sean!  Listen!  Listen to me, Sean.
I could give you a dozen good reasons.
We better go back in.
The Shark.
Positive I.D.?
You can't stop me.
Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope there.
Okay, okay.
You stay right here.  You're going in with me.
What?
That's it?  Probably?  Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
Can't you tell?
I can see that. Don't you know this is a big deal?
Because they're playing our song.
Fooling around?
It's good with coffee.
One what?  Ah-ha!
It's an island.  Got to run.
Terrific.
In the city, it happened all the time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the Brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies.  Call the cops.  What are we, immune?
Yeah.   I think so.  Mike!  Keep it down, for chrissake!
What'd I say?
Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.
Because of today?  The beach?
Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is.  What did they....
I'll give notice.
Mike's out there.
Two of them are still missing!
What am I, an ass?  When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything.
If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!
That's what he said.
Now I really want to see it.
You going to fool around with Mike?  Well, I'm not doing anything with him.
Hang on, hang on...Okay, go.
Who'd you ask?
Mike?  Our Mike?
I'm going.
That's not it.  My dad told me not to go.
Anyone want to go the lighthouse?
You always go with Andy.
Brody's riding his tower.
So it can't be done like that.  The man's a menace, plain and simple.
Get the hose!  We've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him!
I can get it.
He's going with you, Doctor.
Yeah.  Down there.
Till this opens, not our wedding.
Don't let him get you.  Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
How come?
Look, Michael... you don't have to come.
Are you scared?
Yeah, and so will I be if I start swimming in that blackass jungle.
No, I don't want to leave now. I'm having too good a time... Of course I'm coming!  You'd think you're gonna leave me?
I'm okay.
Here.
No, you're not.
Me, too.
Okay.
Yes.  It's faster.
So tell Calvin.
Come on.
I can't!  My dad had it, and I don't know if you can inherit it or what, but I got it, and I hate it.  I can't stand it!
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
Who's going to do it?
A shark could have a hundred embryos in its sack.  You know how many are born?  Maybe five. They eat each other before birth! They're born killers!
Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
Let's hope he knows that.
Should be coming out of it soon.
Brian, he's coming around!
Is there such a place?  A cave or something with such a flow?
Don't blame yourself.
Thanks.
Why you sonuvabitch...
Balance, Kelly.  Bal-lance!
On monitor three.  Was a glimpse of something.
That's how they do it, you know. Seizes its prey and shakes its body savagely.  Teeth gnaw through a man like a buzz saw.
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
Reach for the limit I always say.
I'll remember that, my Lordship.
No way.
We're in love.
Watch me, Grandma....
But you always let me....
Not today.  Come on, Thea....
My tea set.  I got my tea set.  Thank you....
Chicken....
I'll be right there.
My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.
I have work....
Thea was attacked by a shark....
She could have been killed...You knew and you didn't tell us...You let your mother think....
Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?  About spending so much time working in the water?
Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
You're silly....
I'll miss you....
Mother....
We haven't had a real talk, have we? We'll do that before I go.
No more sharks.  I'll stay for another week, then....
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
There's a lot...I want to talk about it....
When it killed Sean it was like a stab in the heart.  I knew with absolute certainty that it had come for him. I knew that.  I know it's coming....
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
The whole idea is preposterous....
Yes I can....
Get her started....
Aye, aye, Captain....
Good news travels fast....
I fly elephants for smugglers....
You too, Michael....
I'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen....
A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
May your sex life be as busy as your shirt....
They put bombs on dolphins....
You're nothing but a bunch of goddamn romantics.  You're never going to amount to anything.
Okay.. .we're done, man....
Okay...we got it together....
How long have you known Hoagie?
Maybe it's gone....
I live to hear the sound...You all right?
Mom....
The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his....
My equipment doesn't crap out....
It's my fault...I have to....
In a few minutes....
We're out of decaf...We're out of petty cash...And we're out of requisition forms....
Anything to do before I go home?
Cow tipping?
Deputy Brody will take care of it personally.
Two dogs. He should do the dogs.
Watch my lips .. <u>Don't get into it</u> ..
A dollar? .. Not worth giving up for a dollar ..
Thank Christ we got a witness.
Let me just keep going a while. She might remember something?
No way .. not me, Mister. I'm not going up there again. Might find someone's prick in a hot-dog roll.
Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime.
No, I think you'll find I looked like he could have? By accident even? He's up here spraying the scenery all day.
Are you sure you didn't call?
That's just what I wanna find out.
Hey ..
Laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. See these striations right here?  It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? Rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something?
Then <u>where's the body</u>? .. Where's the body, and <u>why's he hidden it</u>?
And did they?
I want Serato ..  Why can't I have Serato?
Maybe he's lying to you?
Just walk away from me, Taylor ..
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
Me?
Yes.
What color was it?
It was probably the wind.
No.
Oh.
How d'you know what I'm like?
Just your age.
Fifty-seven .. I don't mind ..
You know? How do you know?
I don't want them to arrest you.
I been told to take your car in, Sir.
He tells her, "bye-bye," and she gets "attacked." Well, give me a fucking break! There <u>is</u> no "Ser- ial Killer." Stick her name up in neon, there's still no Serial kil- ler! And I ain't the only one say- ing it. Everyone in this building is saying it. And I mean <u>everyone</u>.
"Dad says we gwan sleep on it.
Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.
You are not a loser.
No.
There is something missing here.
You know I didn't ever want to hurt you.
"Something in the way.  Yeah."
And have fun at your bachelor party.
No, I'm just... anxiously looking past it.  I already had my bachelor party.  It was called "my twenties." See you later.
Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.
Hello?
I just got goosebumps.
Do you have something to drink?
I may not sue.
Actually he said "glad." _ 85.
You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
Easy, easy --
Fine, I just --
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
What --
I don't need you to "stick."
Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
Thanks.
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
Denver got very silent about a day ago.  San Diego's got a fever for Cush.  This stuff tends to happen the night before a draft.  People get crazy.  And San Diego, you should know, is crazy to the tune of seven years for thirty. Signing bonus of eight.  Million.
Mmm.  Hmm.
It's a quality that might come in handy for a commercial sometime. _ 69.
Why not?
Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money.
Good deal, man.
Well, that ain't fair to her.  A single mother, that's a sacred thing, man. _ 103.
I'm worried too.  I'm worried that the only reason I'm here getting my brains blown loose is that you weren't asshole enough to get my ten million three months ago.
I'm asking you a question --
That's an answer.
I think so.
I missed ya.  What can I say?
Jerry, Rod is very very upset. Tyson, no!
I know you say to take the Arizona offer, but my husband needs more recognition.  _ 25.
Not a chance.
Damn right.
Okay.  I've been hogging it. You're right.  _ 76.
Can you be quiet?
Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and come back.
Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
Eric...
I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night.  Am I right?
That one time was just the bumper.
I don't think so.
That's because it wasn't on their list. Who knows what else they were up to?
KEEP GOING!
What did you think?
Closer you get to the water, the bigger things get.
Then we go home?
No. Although I've studied them in the wild.
Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.
There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The "plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like that.
Back out! Move!
Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help.
That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas, you actually wear it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa?
No.  I feel something.
Is there anything we've forgotten? Anything at all?
Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
You'll need an animal behaviorist, someone with unimpeachable credentials.  I believe you already know Sarah Harding.  She's got theories about parenting and nurturing among hunter/scavengers I bet she'd be dying to prove on a scale like this.  If you convince her to go, it'll be a major coup.  When she publishes, the scientific community must take it seriously.
My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force.
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
Good.
InGen is my livelihood, Dr. Malcolm, and I will jealously defend its interests.  People will know what I want them to know when I want them to know it.
You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous.
What do you think they want?!
So that others would know about this place?
Funded by whom?
Then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back.  I'll call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now.  This expedition is over.
These formations.  They're dried --
I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years, been freelance since '91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.
Stop the program!  Stop the program!
You're sure we have to?
What now?
I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
What one?
Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.
They are?  I'll be damned.
You won't be able to miss them.  Can't miss them.
Control?!  You never had control!  I was overwhelmed by the power of this place.  So I made a mistake too.  I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now.  You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. John, there's nothing worth picking up.  The only thing that matters now are the people we love.  Alan, Lex, and Tim.  And John, they're out there where people are dying - - people are dying, you know?
They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.
Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
Dilophosaurus.
Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.
I don't know.
Microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome.  That's what?
No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle!
Please - - chance it.
That'll - it'd be a first; man and dinosaur all die together.  John's plan. 
He had to leave early to be with his daughter.  She's getting a divorce.
Why not?
I've never been a rich man.  I hear it's nice.  Is it nice?
Yes it is.
Tim, you're going to have to let go of the fence.  Tim! Get down right now.  Get off the fence!  Now!
Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
Wu?
What does he mean by "target audience"?
Alright.
No, I didn't hear anything.  No, we're okay.
Oh, I hate the other kind.
Timmy, listen to Dr. Grant!
Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.  Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them.  Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!
But this is nature!  Why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all!
I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....
I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
Thanks, Dad.
That means they only eat vegetables.  But for you, I think they'd make an exception.
Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...
No, no... listen, when I get back to New York we'll meet with the Board.
Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years?
We're not talking about truth, we're talking about perception. And the perception is that Crystal Lake means inbred psychopaths running around the hills with axes and hockey masks chopping up teenagers.  That, my dear, is what we call an _image problem_.
Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
Mister Biller... now that we can see the lake, I think we should follow the shoreline to --
I want to look at the rest of the house.
_Krueger_...
It's all right.  Now... we're going to need a really good head-doctor for this. Someone who can get up on the stand and tell the jury that our client is mentally insane and has been for years...  We'll go through a dozen doctors before we find one who's willing to testify for us.
One of the deputies is pretty cute. I think she likes me.
This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?
Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.
Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...
How do we prove it?
Well, I'm onto something more useful.  You ever hear of a man named Fred Krueger?
_Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming.
How long will the effect last?
Let's split up. You take the left side, I'll take the right. We'll meet in front of the Cineplex.
For the moment! You've only got about two minutes left! Hurry! Ruby takes off towards the Cineplex...
What is it really?
You could say we represent the <u>un</u>official view of a well-ordered society.
You were his friend.  One link is all they need.
What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?
What an extraordinary request!
Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.
You must make the time.  Where do you go off to in the lunch hour?
I did not realize it was obligatory.
You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
There are some people I'd like you to meet.  Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock?
You strike me as a man with a defined notion of injustice -- a high concern for the lot of your fellow men.  And yet you're able to remain an outsider.  With the concomitant air of ... superiority?
What of it?
Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
Now Burgel's one of the authorities?
-- Accident and Compensation Association.
We know that.
If someone was waiting here in the hallway to spirit her away, wouldn't they have shut the door as quietly as possible?
Close only by virtue of antithesis.
"Accident and Compensation" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.
Yes, well -- we're looking for a new village now.  If we stay too long at one source ... people become suspicious.
As a matter of fact you've caught us in a state of considerable excitement.  Our latest preparation we believe -- we pray -- is perfected. It should take years off her.
It's gone out so quickly?
What's to become of us now?
I think you're trying to run before you can walk, Ann.
Now now, Ann! Try be to polite.
Do they have him on display at the weekends?
Value? ... Value?
I can't imagine you crying.
This shit is bad luck! Don't you understand? You treat it like a game - two men have already died!
A man eater! Fantastic!  Making history, Herb
I can't get back to the wall! I'll get eaten!
Yeah.
What about him? Yes.
Sure dear, yes.
And Cannes was quite fun, quite; and we played baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little Italian marquis quite enthusiastic for me -- but a young man can be so silly --
Mm.
A few more days. We know who did this.
Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
No, that's not --
From the beginning I don't know why the hell he's messin with you. If he was me he'd know better. If he was even a city boy he'd know better. You're a whore Miss Daniel, that's the truth of it, right? Now somethin I'd like you to look at.
Then it doesn't matter what I do any more, does it?
Miss Daniel? My name is Klute -- John Klute --
You said that.
Isn't that sweet.  Well it could be any one of them bubi; I get to see them all.
I don't want you to look up. There's someone on the skylight.
He never told me.
No.
Yeah, you got to me.
-- Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?
If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann --
Thanks for the jolly news. I thought maybe you'd left town by now. You kind of just disappeared. But you boys from Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don't you?
Why?
Bree --
Right back at the start, right?
You said it was over, right? You said not to worry any more, all over, right?
Can you use these?
Then, close the case.
You must be discouraged.
Someone's been doing all these things.
What?
No, I'd -- like to be in on it.
All right. All right --  John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right?
Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.
OK and one of them  Jane McKenna -- she blows a little jealous of Bree - you know? -- Bree comes first? And evidently she knew the freak --- that he was a dumper -- she conned me into passing him to Bree, you know, so Bree'd get hurt. I didn't know. Till afterwards.
Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.
Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
If we get anything from the lab, we'll have it by noon. And just think -- all he really had to do was write us a letter.
No sir, we don't state that. We're countin --
He's in his room, playing.
Not particularly.
The prospect of losing my child.
Do you like to be with your mommy?
What do you like best about your daddy?
Welcome to the greatest show on earth.
The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine. Where is mommy?
That's right.  You're absolutely right...It's been a long time since I made French toast.
I'm sorry, pal, but I had a meeting and--
That's okay...
I hate it.
I'm allergic to onions.
Oh, for God's sake...Here.
Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?
Sure.  Lots of times.
Uh, huh?
Uh, uh...We didn't have television then.
Your mom knows all about The Face, okay?  Don't worry, she'll tell The Face to beat it.
No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning.
Then I have concluded my questions.
The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.
Mrs. Kramer, can you tell the court why you are asking for custody?
How long do you plan to live in New York, Mrs. Kramer?
No questions.
It was good.  He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler.
I understand and I'm absolutely sure something wonderful will turn up....  ...after the first of the year.
A heavy drinker?
No.
Was he unfaithful?
What?
C'mon, Joanna, you don't mean that.  You're a terrific mother--
I am not!  I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother.  I yell at him all the time.  I have no patience.  No...No.  He's better off without me.  Ted, I've got to go...I've got to go.
Fine.
Please, Ted.  I never would have brought it up if I thought--
Joanna, what the hell is--
Please...Please don't stop me. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do..
Murray had some ideas about the Fire and Ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs...  I think they're kind of interesting.
I don't.  Jim, this isn't anything like what we talked about.  It's not even close.
Kramer...
No.  Uh, uh.  Tell him I asked for it Friday.  I want it Friday. Period.
Then you don't have a choice. Have Billy at the Seventy- Fifth Street entrance to Central Park, Saturday at ten.
Things? What kind of things?
I'd like to know what the hell kind of courage it takes to walk out on your husband and your child?
Slow down...Slow down...
C'mon, Thel.  So Charley had a little fling.  So what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.
California?
Uh, huh...She said she had a good job, was playing a lot of tennis.  She wanted to know all about Billy.
Thel, listen to me.  If, on the million to one shot that I should--  That anything should happen to me.  Would you take care of Billy?
Can I free the prisoners?
I will not approve it.
And we will begin with tearing it down.
Soon.
It is calm.
Yes, but they say he did.
Yes.
True suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions. Birth, illness, grief, old age, poverty, pain, death -- these are surferings.
No. This war is almost over.
Tell me.
So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
Non-violence means co-operation when it is possible. Resistance, when it is not.
You decide.
Is that true or pretend?
Ahh.
No, Holiness.
This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet.
Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. We have compassion for all people.
Look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. Look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. Look for a kind heart.
No.  Do you?
Well, he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well... I think he had Alzheimer's, he would be coherent one day, incoherent the next and one <u>coherent</u> day, he asked me to end his suffering.  I wouldn't <u>do</u> it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that I finish him off.  Finally I just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead.
You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest.
He's not gonna hurt <u>me</u>.
<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
You're crawling around like a--
A spring trap!
This could end up saving your life,--
He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.
We're ready.
You do?
Okay.  Lead him in.  Okay, everybody up on the trucks. We aim for the stomach or side... there's little chance the darts will pierce his hide.  <u>Everybody</u> <u>up</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>trucks</u>.
You shoot on my order.  If he charges, I'll be yelling "go" which means drivers take off.  And drive fast, they can move on land.  You set?
That hurt my feelings.
They won't.  He's taken human life, the mission will be to put him down.
You're not okay, your leg's a mess.
There <u>have</u> been Northern sightings. But not <u>this</u> North.
<u>Something's</u> in that water.
Skipping stones.  Look how flat that water is, you can get ten skips on a good one.
It's too dangerous for--
You flew up here because your boss--
No.  U.S. Wildlife is on their way.
What are you talking about?
Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
Let's get away from the shore.
It's okay.
<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!
Calm down.
Back us in a little, we need to get a shot!
You wanna ride in my truck?
Yeah.
So does he.
Other than to eat us?
And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?
This is a little different.
Not yet.
I got nothing against--
It looks like a branch.
I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?
She's worried about the cow now.
I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--
Well on this one I'd like you to be.
Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
Not random at all, maybe. Like there's some pattern here...?
Well, except for the one girl.
Some fishermen in West Virginia found an unidentified girl's body. It's a Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in the water about a week, and Jack needs somebody that can print a floater. Think you can handle it?
Listen, I hope you never need a thing I've taught you. But you've got something... Jack sees it, I do too. If you ever need to, you can shoot.
Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!
Get me out!
I don't know! Get me out!!
NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU
Lecter has already named Buffalo Bill.
I won't disturb anything, Mr. Yow, I promise. Be gone before you know it.
Oh.
Who's the subject?
Murdered...? How?
What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.
State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?
Let's get some coffee and talk.
Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours.
No, Starling, there isn't time. And you've still got crucial work to do in Ohio. We want him for murder, not kidnapping. I'm counting on you to link him to the Bimmel girl, before he's indicted.
Not lately. But maybe someday.
Sometimes you do.
I have no doubt of it.
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.
Why don't you tell me about "Miss Mofet?" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?
And have them clomping about in my life? Oh dear, no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own.  How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice? May I call you Clarice?
Who killed your patient?
Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
By the book, he's a sadist.
A cattle ranch?
How long did you live there?
Two months.
There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them, and been rejected.
How would he test?
Then tell me how.
No, he covets. That's his nature. And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer.
No. We just -
Promise...?  Then why not take your case file? I won't be needing it anymore.
I'm the one who found his perforating proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, right now?  Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I?
The Latin name comes from two rivers in Hell. Your man - he drops these girls into rivers, every time. Didn't I read that?
Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.
Yes. He said... "do not try to make them understand you."
Why did they turn back?
Thank you so much.
My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yours.
Because what I am interested in is right here...
Maybe...
Alice?
Winter with the Delaware, my father's cousins. And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.
He knew the consequences. And he stayed.  Are those the actions of a criminal?  ...Duncan, do something.
"Justice"?  If that's "justice"..., then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for these people.
"Some"?
Yes. Yes, I will.
I am sorry, Duncan...
Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
That is sedition! Treason!
We don't.
Tradin' your skins in Castleton?
...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
You forget yourself!
I know.  One has to give Americans "reasons" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here.
I thought British policy is 'Make the World... England', sir.
Thank you. How can I reward you?
And who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon England's policies in her own colonies? To come and go without so much as a "by your leave."
Sir!!!  Third rank! Twelve paces! Forward march!
Fire!
That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well.
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
Le mot d'ordre?
It was when it counted a couple of million years ago when the seas came in and drove us into the water.  Most homo sapiens didn't make it...Danakil man... <u>adapted</u>.
What has?
Crunch...Implosion.
Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!
What?
No.  I'm just being friendly.
Has it helped?
Maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir.
Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.
I can't see them!
I signed-up for the stock option.
Russian, French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, German, a little Hindu, some Serbo Croat and a smattering of Swahili...standard pre-med background...
Pretty good.  He sent them out videotaping outcrop.
Who cares?
You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.
I'm going to try to remove it.
It's had a meal.
How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
The latch is screwed up.  Or the hinge.
Right.
A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six . . . no, five days?
Seven hundred for the pair.
The Baptist got his name from drowning people for Hatchet.
That inspires confidence, that does.
Think about what you're going to say, Ed; we are on thin ice.
Apart from those shotguns.
No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that.
Fucking Northern monkeys.
Yes?
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
About twenty minutes.
All right, Dad.
Is that you, Dean?
That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.
It is too late for you to start thinking John. It is a possibility and that is good enough for me. And after you strip the house, I want you to get every thieving slag this side of Ceylon and torture them, badly. I want to know who is responsible, otherwise I will hold you responsible.
But...  Give it us here, you dozy sod. You hide and get the guns ready. Wait until they are well in, then give it to 'em.
Just give me the keys.
And the weed?
All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.
You will what?
I like your bar.
I can't help you, Plank.
You know it doesn't include the amp.
Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.
At what, exactly?
My van is half full.
So I've just got to put you in, and I am off.
That's going on optimism.
You're not funny Tom; you're fat and look as though you should be funny, but you're not.
How come you know so much about black cocks and so little about white pussy?]
You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.
So?
When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.
I-I can do the job, sir.
Do whatever they tell you--
Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
Sergeant?
You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.
Yeah, this is Skinny.
Charley Wade.
That badge--
--it didn't come out of a cereal box.
You got a cause of death?
So he could have gone out to the base, hopped the fence, dug down into the dirt on the old rifle range and had a heart attack.
Last year was awful rough--Mama passing on and the whole business with O.J.--I mean it's not like it was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop--
--they hadn't pulled me off that woman I would have jerked a knot in her.
You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--
Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
Come on in.
Go out through the back.
They fought against the Indians?
Well--
He does.
I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy?
If I stayed out past ten with the guys she'd go into her Madame Butterfly routine--
We should just do it.
I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.
I've got the forensics fella coming down from the Rangers. No way to know how old the body is without some lab work.
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here.
I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
Because I'm your father.
Aqui! [Here!]
Mercedes Gonzales Ruiz.
Hay pasado un accidente muy grave-- [There's been a bad accident--]
I thought you were married!
I am marry to the cousin of a friend-- but only to be able to live here. This is the mother of my child--
Tipico.
Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]
Better late than never. Korean War hero, Sheriff for near thirty years-- Buddy Deeds Memorial P--
That's not the whole story. The Mexicans that know, that remember, understand what Buddy was for their people.  Hell, it was Mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him.
We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow--
Not a peep. Buddy run the man out of town.
Right.
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something.
I think somewhere between Roderick Bledsoe's club and his house, Wade ran into Buddy Deeds. I think Buddy put a bullet in him, waited for him to die, threw him in the trunk of the Sheriff's car and drove him out by the Army post, I think he buried him under four feet of sand and never looked back.
Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man I ever met--
Widow's benefits. He figured it would make the disappearance look better, and that Mexican gal was just scrapin' by after Charley killed her man. They didn't get hooked up till late--
Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.
You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
Maybe you're just getting less patient.
Right. When he was killed.
So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys.
It could have just been a box lunch from the jail.
He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
I'll see what's going on.
Want to take a walk?
Yeah.
I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
Yeah.
I didn't want to be going around your back.
No, Sheriff, I'm just--
Hell of a spot to put a business.
Runnin' numbers illegal.
You bet.
I think maybe he taught Swann.  This is me.  See ya around.
You heard right.
That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle.  Which was presumably the idea.  These are about Nix.
You didn't think it was just going to be you and me?  A lot of people believed in Nix. They haven't forgotten his promise.
It's an illusion.
You'll do more.than that.
Not yet.
I swear... this is the place Swann told me about.  The rocks...
Maybe he'll show you.
Yes...
Yes...
Yes.
Harry.
I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
That's my business. Harry.
You said you weren't with him for love.
I'm sure.  He's dead.
Out!  Out!
For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
Heaven and Hell?
So could you walk on water?
What about Swann's miracles?
Oh, I've got plenty.
I don't think the dead much care.
Are you sure?
Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
You want more money, is that it?
Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?
Help me.
Does anybody?
Oh yes.  We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together.
People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know?
It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
How the fuck do you do that?
I did it for Dorothea.
It's me betrayed him.
Is that all?
Is that all?
Yes.
Nobody's better off this wav!
You didn't try hard enough.
Can you do it?
No!
Because you've got nothing else to live for.
I'm thinking about it.
It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
I'm here for the week.
No.
Do you want to have some breakfast?
No, yes, it does...
Yeah? But look at you.
Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way...
When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
Where'd you grow up?
In D.C., my dad was the Ambassador to France in the eighties, so we went to school in Paris for a few years... but we mostly lived in D.C., and they were never around... and then I moved to Los Angeles when John and I got married... it's so different there.
You are.
I know, but that's what you like about me.
Fuck off.
I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...
Yeah, look at that thing.
Hi, Bob.
I'll miss you.
Take them.
He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...
That's not what I'm talking about.
Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?
It's Lydia, your wife.
You wanna come?
What?
Bad?
Hmmm.
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
No.  Of course not.  Mmmm.  Anago.  My favorite.
I can't believe Will killed him.
We're still going to be together.
And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
Quite a compliment coming from you, doctor.
You know I'm not comfortable with this.
You heard voices, you know you did.
Maya, for the last time, I will not tolerate these obsessions.
I don't have the experience.  Father Thomas should officiate.
You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.
Listen to me, Peter.  You can't let the ravings of a madman disturb you, okay?
Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.
You killed my parents.
Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
Yes.  We won, that's right.
Thirteen.  The last time, can you believe it?  This is how he says "Goodbye?"
Do you remember Henry Birdson?  The math professor who won the Salwen Medal, then went home and killed his family?
I cranked it all the way up.  Nothing but hum.
What?!?!
I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
You were not baptized.  At least I don't believe it was Christian.  Your baptism was performed by your uncle, James McKenzie.
Townsend, he had some of Father's books.
When's your birthday?
I see things.  My worst fears.  You need to know something, Peter.  I was possessed once.  Like Birdson.  It took Father Lareaux six days to pull me out of it.
We're going to do this.
I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.
I don't know.  Extra apartment keys. What's it matter?
Terrific.
And what's that mean?
We need all the help we can get.
You can't back out on me now.  We need to be sure.
He can see you Thursday.
Sometimes I can just feel the numbers.
It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.
And what about you?  What about Peter Kelson?  Where is your moral compass?
Yeah, look at that sweet face.  You'd never guess he killed nine people.  I'm gonna get my smokes.  Be right back.
You're too old to smoke.  Won't be able to shoot hoops with your grandkid.
Child, take a bite.
Engaged.
Find out where they're registered and send them a gift.
Thanks, sweetheart.
You're cold?
Uh-huh.
Monica.  You grew up together, right? Quincy's told me about you.
Four days.
Why not?
No one's forcing her.
Damn, Lena...  Who is he?
I was just showing emotion.
I know.  But chances are...
She hates all freshmen.
I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.
You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.
Yup.  So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years.
I wouldn't know.
Sometimes.  But what's the alternative, not playing?  You remember big Toni?  She quit last year, now she's working at some bookstore.  I mean, look at us. They treat us like we're Hollywood stars over here.  We just played in the championship game.  It doesn't get much sweeter than this.
My Dad plays for the "Clippers."  He says I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma play for them, too.  Same number and everything.
Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.
She don't know how to box, I bet.  My dad showed me how to fight like Ali.
Please.
I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
You had four offensive rebounds.
You sure?
What'd it say?
Fine, Quincy.
My court, I go first.
She understands.
Coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew. If I'm late, I don't suit up.
You think for once we could talk about something besides basketball?
I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.
Cheap date.
Least she had time for me.
What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?
I don't think so.
Damnitt, Monica.  This ain't about us anymore, it's about me.
Oh yeah?
Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
No.
Thanks.
Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...
Wow.
Cause I don't get it.
We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?
I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago.
Better late than never, right?
So you're gonna bitch up?
Monica, after that stuff with my dad, I couldn't trust anybody, okay.  I mean, I was lost.  So you are forgiven.  But that was five years ago.  I moved on.
Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting.
Business folks.
We still have to go?
Yeah.
I don't know, he had a meeting or something.
Mom, we can't let something like this mess up the family.
Okay...
there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit.
No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it.  It's not true.
A case like this could hang around for months and I'm up for this player relations job with the "Clips."  This gets out, false or not, no one'll touch me.
I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I ain't that kid's father.
I'm saying I handled my responsibilities like a man.  But when you're in the NBA, you pull into a city and there's a hundred women waiting at the hotel.  And another twenty that made it past security on your floor.  And the boldest one is standing right at your door.  And after awhile, it just becomes part of the game.  I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't have.  But I did it cause I love you.
Always thought "can't" wasn't in a man's vocabulary.
Look, I'm busy.
HEY FUCK YOU DON WATCH IT NOW.
I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.
I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
Now STOP IT and LISTEN to me right now. I AM DYING, I GOT SICK...now I fell down and I'm Not...DON'T --
I'm not lying to you, I'm not --
Honey.
GET OUT.
It's the LAPD, can you open the door, please?
Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
What?
-- listenin' to that music so loud: You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears?
I got a call of a disturbance, screaming and yelling, loud music.  Has there been some screaming and yelling?
It's fine.
ok.
Yeah.
That's great, thank you.
Arlight, then.  Cheers.
Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --
No, no.  I was wondering...man oh man. I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want to do which is to ask you on a date.
You wanna go on a date with me?
I thought you were flirting with me a little.
Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?
Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's?
To not do that.  To not do that that we've maybe done -- before --
Ok.  I'll tell you everything and you tell me everything and maybe we can get through all the piss and shit and lies that kill other people....
I didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, I know --
It's ok.
It's ok.
What?
They're here, they're fine. In the dressing room.  See you later --
Have you ever been there?
Not enough, what do you want?
-- Richard.
It's ok, boy.
Put me on the payroll, find out, find out wassup --
They don't have substitute teachers where you go to school?
No Can Do.
Is it real love?
A very chatty-kind, you do, indeed, it seems.
-- Samuel Johnson.
Why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold.
Your teeth are fine.
Don't do this, Don.
Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
-- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
I'm listening.  I'm getting better.
-- how the fuck can I say anything to that -- I don't know what to say to that --
...ah...
Get a girlfriend.
...ah...maybe...yeah...she's a good one...
Yeah.
-- it's not him. it's not him. He's the fuckin' asshole...Phil..c'mere...
No.
....getthat on the tv....there...
Just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know -- And Bing-Bam-Boom I'm away on a tangent -- I get so fuckin' amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: Because I Am What I Believe. I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what? I'm gettin' pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways.
I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did.
I'm quietly judging you.
Around here.
the valley?
Psychology major?
Kind of.
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?
.....have you ever seen this..I mean, never mind, you said --
Uh. huh.
Quietly, slow down, whoa --
You can't just come in here.
I am calm.
Don't test me, you wanna talk about what the law book says, we can do that, push me far enough and I'll take you to jail -- now calm down.
I live alone.
Maybe so, but I'm gonna ask you one more time: Is Anyone Else In This House Right Now?
THAT'S NOT MINE.
What the fuck is this, Jimmy?
Then what?
-- that you shouldn't have done? That you regret, what? This? What's this? Fuck, man, c'mon.  Treat me like an asshole, but treat me like an <u>asshole</u>.
You're making me feel so dirty and shitty. I feel like a big piece of shit right now.
Will you say my name?
What happend to you?
I got in trouble at school.
I need you to get me Paula --
Love you too..
Yeah.
I'm not mad.  I am, but I'm not.  Y'know?
I think that you know.
Maybe...I don't...
Do you know the answer to this?
I'm her father.
I'II go....is it...back here?
-- that can't happen.  Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
I'm trying to help, Linda --
Shut the fuck up.
BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT HE DIDN'T ASK YOU, HE DOESN'T WANT HIM, HE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK TO HIM, SO FUCK YOU THAT HE ASKED THAT. THERE IS NO ONE BUT ME AND HIM.
Hi.
Must have alot goin' on for all that stuff you got back there, eh?  You could have quite a party all that stuff....
I COME IN HERE - YOU DON'T KNOW, YOU DON'T KNOW WHO THE FUCK I AM OR WHAT MY LIFE IS AND YOU HAVE THE FUCKING BALLS, THE <u>INDECENCY</u> TO ASK ME A QUESTION ABOUT MY LIFE --
I'd like to get an order of...um...peanut butter.
Water.
Ok. One of those.  And...um...Barely Legal?
That's it.
Maybe.
I'm sick of being the one, the one who always has to do everything, I don't want to be the one always --
-- talk in the car, talk in the car, moves your ass, c'mon --
Bullshit.  Bullshit. You know the answer to every goddamn question and I knew the answer to those questions and I'm not half as smart as you are so What Happened?
I said I'm fine.
Yes.
You're two fuckin' days from the record, get through this and I'II do anything for you, you just gotta get through this --
It's ok.
It's ok.
Yes.
Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
...what...?
It's frogs.  It's raining frogs.
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
It's raining frogs from the sky.
Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away, but as a man.
I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.
Replace the king.
You seek facts, when it would be better to seek truth.
In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --
He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months.
Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
But --
You're a fool!
You -- You cannot ask me to betray my king!  I have sworn to him!
Catacombs.  Very holy.
I expected action.  There was no killing, no fighting, I was useless.
Bread and wine... in that cupboard.
Who does?
I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here.
It is already done.  I have just stopped at Mother's grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you.
You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
Save my son, d'Artagnan.
Get out of my way.
The cannons killed Raoul!  The cannons, and love.  But not the King.
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
I suppose... it is to remember there are many people who have never been in a prison, who pass such beauty every day, and never see it.
How did you know -- ?
D'Artagnan...
Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --
At least help Raoul.
He is my brother.
Forgive?!
What number, on the first page?
Two-thirty-seven:  "... And the descendants of Japeth are these: Obediah, Zebulon, Hezekiah..."
Yes, yes, go on.
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
Oh Louis, Louis...
If you guys want in, fine.  Just remember this is our jurisdiction.
When did you join the force?  You know, the police force, the place you work...
I'm done talking until I get a lawyer.
Nothing!  He didn't do nothing!
Well let's get his ass to the garage!  Some lead...
You got any family?
No.  A witness.
No, but I'm listening.
No...I'm in some trouble...
Hello Tubbs.  Can I come in?
I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
I got a lot of free time, you know what I mean?
How about Marvosa and the others?
I'll access the LAPD mainframe, but we gotta be careful - that one's kind of tricky -
Hop in.
Are you a regular there?
Did you have sexual intercourse with the woman in question?
It was you who did the asking.
I wouldn't presume to try.
It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.
When do they go to press?
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
I'll try to keep him as far away from it as I can...
I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...
That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think.
What's one way?
Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack.
After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it.  Where's Lector now?
What's it narrow down to?
'Changes?'
Something Lecktor said.
He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?
There's some film cans in the far corner of the room underneath one of the windows.
Will. Get right back here. He just called.
For Christ's sake get him!
When do you need it?
In eight days.
It'll do fine.
They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
I'll get it.  Stay right here. You look very good in the sun...
Shut up. Stop. Stop it.
Atoning, Mr. Lounds.
Yes.
Yes.
I don't know...
In a little while I'll help you understand.
No. I don't want to see you.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Do you see?
'No' what?
Not me.
No.
Absolutely,
Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....
Three, four hours.
No. I can help you.
You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
Cut the general crap.
Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not.
What happened to them?
I call him a monster.
What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
I remember.
William: you are going to make yourself sick or get yourself killed.
Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
What's this Mama shit?
Will?  You could come up here.
Tell her I called.
I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.
Go on to the house.
Oh, Jesus... Come in.  Honey...!
I can't thank you enough, I...
I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom...
With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait.
I got it. Thank you.
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
You haven't threatened to take away my books yet.
I hope you have a second chance...
And this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows!  It takes place in a taxi stand!  And you're gonna be the Fonzie!
HANG ON, you ain't heard the best part!  ABC has seen your foreign man character, and they want to turn him into --  "Latka," a lovable, goofy mechanic!!!
Okay... I'll go back.  But just let them know, first they ain't gettin' Latka.  They're gettin' Tony!
But wasn't it funny?
Andy!  You don't get it!  They don't want you back.
It's visualization therapy.  He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease.
Of course!  But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support!  I can't be surrounded by negative energy.
No clubs.  I wanna reach the TOP!  Carnegie Hall...!
Really?
Andy!
Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody else.
I really want one.  One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter.
Hi... am I late?
No thanks.
Have you told your family?
Don't worry!  The kids will love it --
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
Boy, they totally fell for it!  I'm only acting crazy!
Why??  I... I attend every year.
Yes -- we do not doubt your devotion to TM.  But we feel that perhaps... you and the program have grown apart philosophically.
It is apparently not working.
Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
Look... I don't know what your problem is...
Yeah.  They don't know whether to be sad, or angry.
There!
Bob.
Bob Gorsky.
No way.  Not possible.
It's Choi.
Morpheus will take him when he's ready.
No, it's all right.
What are you doing?
Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store.
We have no choice.
I've been looking for you, Neo.  I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time.  They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do.
Right now?
You could say that.
Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we both know there's more to it than that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?
Wild, isn't it?
Do you think my being faster, stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place?
What -- what lesson?
She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is.
Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong.  She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path.
And you still believe I'm the One?
We're on our way --
Yes, sir.
Most guys do.
Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.
What?
Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.
How much like it?  Was it the same cat?
What?
Why?
I'm coming with you.
No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else.
Do what?
Not yet.
The last human city.  The only place we got left.
Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?
Hell yes!
Every leader of every ship is given the codes to Zion's mainframe computer which can be accessed only through the Matrix.  They are used only in emergencies.  If an agent had those codes and got inside Zion's mainframe they could disable the entire defense system.  It would be the end of everything.
I know that's what it looks like, but it's not.  I can't logically explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed.  I understand that now. That's why I have to go.
Guns.  Lots of guns.
Look fella...this is private...
Let go of her.
Don't go to any trouble.  We believe you... We believe you.
'Dost thou say this of thyself, or have others told thee of me?'
'Thou art then a king?'
'Thou sayest it; I am a king.  This is why I was born and why I have come into this world, to bear witness to the truth.  Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.'
Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.
Wouldn't bother me.
There won't be any this week.
What do you mean?
Ok, now that that's over with...what are you gonna make me for breakfast?
I could have told you that.
We'll get some food from my aunt's. I'll get in through the fire escape. She's always got something.
Did you see them run!
That's not going to help.
You tell me that in front of these creeps?
I'm not smart...I'm stupid, remember. I'm so stupid that you have to look out for me, remember?
No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
No.
I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
We'll settle it tonight.
Charlie, this is business.
Fine.
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
Stripper?
Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
About that shooting last night...I was there and...
No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
Well...
Anything specific?
Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
The girls like it loud.
Hey, c'mon - no bullshit - friends.
Yeah...just had it delivered...
Yeah, I think so.
You what?
Friends of yours Michael.
...I don't know, Daddy seems funny to me.  Ever since Joe showed.  It's like he dropped from the clouds...
He's cute.
Very.
-- Plus we've got a baritone with a balalaika coming from The Russian Tea Room.  I've dressed him in a Cossack shirt and he'll sing Nelson Eddy songs.
I wasn't going to say --
But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay.  Because I know you love me.  Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face, "What does she want now?"
Good, good.  Glad to hear it.
Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --
So I guess a blowjob's out of the question?
What side of the industry did you say you were on?
"Death and Taxes"?
But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.
Did you just hear something?
I thought it was great, I thought you and Big John would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop --  Instead it was --
As much as Joe's?
Yours.
Never mind Bontecou.  I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man.
We'll do it together.  I'll clue you in.  Timing's got to be right.  The old man says it's up to Joe.
The train's left the station, pal, and you're aboard.  Would you like to hear the silver lining?  Check that, gold.  I've been working with John Bontecou all along.  We had a game plan -- acquire Parrish Communications then break it apart and peddle it piece-by-piece to the highest bidder.  I set it up for him, he smacks it out of the park.
Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.
You wait here'n to take us?  Like you bus driver to dere?
Don' need you okayin'.
Good morning, Jennifer.
Didn't you call a Board meeting?
It's so very nice to see you again.
I didn't know that.
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
How nice you look.  Is that your uniform?
That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
Girlfriend?
-- I guess you haven't.
How beautiful.
Nowhere?  I'm...here.
Don't.  That will come later.
-- That was the place... and you were the guy.
'Threw' you?  Where?
No.
No.
How are you?  How're you feeling?
Sounds fair enough.
You've got a deal.
So can I.
Yes.
It's all yours.
Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife --
I don't know.
You tell me, Bill.
With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
I don't expect you to.
It's time to put this person where he belongs.
The jacket and the pair of pants came with the body I took.  Let me ask your opinion.  Do I blend in?
Speak up, please.
What you were talking about.
I'm sorry, I --
What the hell is this?  Who are you?
What question?
I am, this is it.  B Day.
How's that, Quince?
Thank you, Quince.
Joe, you don't know how glad I am you're aboard.  Anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man, I'm in his corner.
The vodka.  What'd I tell you?
Sure.
Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
Fine, fine.  Big doing up here.  Why are you still down here?
Does Drew tell you everything?
Yeah.  I guess so.
Don't get dirty, Dad --
Well, it worries me.  I want you to get swept away.  I want you to levitate.  I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.
Cut it out, Susan.  You and I've got to talk.  Big day tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.
Nothing.
Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?
Where's he going?
I'm sorry.
Yes, but --
No -- I love you so much and I want you to promise me something.  I don't want you to ever worry about me.  If anything should happen, I'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right.  -- And I have no regrets.
Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.
So you're a one-girl guy?
Because I like you so much.  You have coffee here every morning, don't you?  If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
Why not?
Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to her!
Sense of humour went with the memory, huh? You know why you're still here, don't you?
It's simple, you just go to the bathroom.
I have no memory.
Why?
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.
Who did this to you?
Yes.
Tell me about her again.
She was beautiful. Perfect to me -				*
What happened?
What are you gonna do?
What does he want?
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
I'm not.
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
I remember my wife dying.
Who's your boyfriend?
I don't know.
Thank you.
You're in a playful mood.
You know it?
Lenny, it's Teddy. Look, stay there, okay? I'm gonna be right over.
Guess I've told you about my condition.
Who?
Probably left it in your room.
You called me. You wanted my help. You know, Lenny, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep using the same jokes.
He's got to have a car, right? We just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him.
I'll ride with him. You follow.
Teddy. Your buddy.
I'm trying to help you. I knew she'd get her claws into you. She doesn't know anything about your investigation, so when she offers to help you, it'll be for her own reasons. Why would I lie? Do not go back to her. Take out a pen, write yourself a note, do not trust her.
Why?
I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town looking for information. The local boys put us in touch.
What the fuck are you talking about?
I guess I can only make you believe the things you want to be true, huh? Like ol'		   * Jimmy down there.
Yes, I will.
I'm not. I was the cop assigned to your			* wife's death. I believed you, I thought			* you deserved the chance for revenge. I helped you find the other guy who was in your bathroom that night. The guy who cracked your skull and fucked your wife.		    * We found him and you killed him.				  *   MEMENTO - Green Revisions 10-4-99 115A.
You in Miami workin' on your complexion...?
"And" what?
Jos Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.
Okay.  You got the "item"?
Nothing.  As in "free, gratis."
It goes very fast.
Are you afraid?  Good.  And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.
I dance...
Okay.  Macon, Georgia is where I was born. Wound up in a juvenile facility.  I was 14.  Then the military.  Then prison.  Because I was dumb and angry.  Then I read.  Then I got smart.  Then I discovered what I know, now...it's all business...
Died in childbirth, having me...
What do you mean?
I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...
Of course.
Would you?  Because if you couldn't, I would be very lonely... I would have left the only world I know and have known since I was seventeen.  But none of this will happen.  So it doesn't matter.  Because we are on the Guajira Peninsula.  And all you see around you...look around... is Archangel de Jesus Montoya- Londono.  He is my man.  And you are a smuggler moving a load...
It still is.  I'm so in this, I don't know which way is up... All I know is I won't let anything bad happen to you.  Just like I said.  And I know we can't ever see each other again.  And we never will.
I confess I have succumbed to my weaknesses.  An inability to see another's point of view.  I've discussed it with professionals.  Even with one of your friends.  She's here now...
It says, "We do not fear you."  It says, "Fuck off and die."  It says, "We get down for recreation..."
So we can close each other's eyes right now.  Real easy.  Real fast.  But, then, nobody makes any money...
Port-Au-Prince.
Like...?
Good.  So let's go...
You're not makin' a move on her...?
There is "undercover."  And there is "Which way is up?"
Okay.  What's up?
If they ran the rental car or lease on this place...even if it's EPIC database in El Paso...they'd have to work through the layers of bullshit three weeks deep.  Then they'd find your deeper, hidden criminal selves...
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Sonny...
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
Switek pulling this off...?  That's not faith; that's delusional...
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
Meaning...?
What...?
Don't guess. Just come for my day's pay owing and to tell you I'm heading East.
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
What'll we do? Leave now or what? Your place or mine? Oh God, the second I looked at you I knew. Did you?
You gonna beat me, Joe?
Oh hell, forget it.
Forget it.
What's that supposed to mean?
So if you want me to hang around for a few days, I thought you should know.
Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.
The coat? A guy I did a favor once gave it to me. Christ.
You wanna know the truth? You dumb bastard, I got it for you. Look at it. Goddam thing's ten sizes too big for me.
I'm going to Florida, that's my only chance.
They gotta be.
Yeah.
What?
I'm going to Florida.
I simply don't have it, Joe.
Take it,easy, boy...  Seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. Most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but I'd say you knew exactly what you want.
No. You got it.
... and taxi fare for me.
Where?
It's already built!  There's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff, but beneath that there's these old catacombs that the Christians built 'bout a thousand fucking years ago to bury their dead.  We're sitting right on top of it -- here.
KNOCK IT OFF!
You want to split your hernia again?
Shit.
I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
Oh Jesus! 
All over.  Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us.  You sure you looking for your friends, man?
Yes...?
Would you recognize him again?
Just what?
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
Aslan, there... 
What do you mean?
We've been notified that they rejected the sentence...
After we're outside the kogus?
What?
What?
And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.
That's a great philosophy.
Who?
The lawyer?
...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...
All right, motherfucker, that's it.
How you know that?  Shit, it was runnin' around with its buttside gone and a fucking pipe through its heart...
Manny never threw the coupling switch!! We're goin' the wrong way!!!
We'll find him. We'll be back and find him.
You know what I mean...
I heard how you talked to him.
Listen to me:  we're getting you out.
That's camouflage...
How?!
Peter-
Try not to sweat?
Ah...
I'm on it.  Don't worry.  Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry, but... I kinda overheard you and Peter.
I know.  Help me get a sample.
I'm not much of a critic.
Sounds good.
--my number one fan.
Of course you will. And your arm will be fine, too. Your shoulder was dislocated pretty badly, but I finally popped it back in there.  But what I'm most proud of is the work I did on those legs. Considering what I had around the house, I don't think there's a doctor who could have done any better.
You want to read it?
I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.
It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but "Misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title.
The swearing, Paul.  There, I said it.
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
No. No, it isn't, it's--  --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would "great" be insulting?
I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
My pleasure.
The Sistine Chapel?
Yeah, that and Misery's Child--those are the only two divine things ever in this world...
Yes.
Don't worry about that. You'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.
I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written.
--cliff-hangers--
I know that, Mister Man--they also call them serials. I'm not stupid, you know.  Anyway, my favorite was Rocket Man, and once it was a no-brakes chapter, the bad guys stuck him in a car on a mountain road and knocked him out and welded the doors shut and tore out the brakes and started him to his death and he woke up and tried to steer and tried to get out, but the car went off a cliff before he could escape and it crashed and burned and--I was so upset and excited and the next week you better believe I was first in line and they always start with the end of the last week and there was Rocket Man trying to get out, and here came the cliff and JUST BEFORE the car went off he jumped free and all the kids cheered--  --but I didn't cheer, I stood right up and started shouting, "This isn't what happened last week--have you all got amnesia?--THEY JUST CHEATED US--THIS WASN'T FAIR--"
It looks wonderful. And so do you.
My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.
Well, it certainly says you.
The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.
That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
You've been out of your room.
It will.
Dome Pear-igg-non it is.
You did perfect. Except for one thing. This time we need two glasses.
It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.
That's nice.
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
It's good you found it.
Yes.
Yes, he is.
I'm sure you know Paul's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books.
I don't know. Does he always phone you when he checks out of hotels?
You think he might be missing?
I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--
I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study.
Marcia, why are you doing this to me? Don't you know I'm scared enough? Don't you think I remember how nobody gave a shit about my first books? You think I'm dying to go back to shouting in the wilderness?  I'm doing this because I have to.  Now, I'm leaving for Colorado to try to finish this and I want your good thoughts--because if I can make it work ...  I might just have something that I want on my tombstone.
Yeah. They're in the semis.
On what.
And my room?
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..
I'll be damned.  It's McCloy, the Biocyte CEO.
..in the building...
Not for seven more minutes.
And the check's in the mall.
He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
There's not enough time in the world for any of it to be bad.
If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
Listen to what?
Your help?  What are you talking about?
Well, Ethan Hunt, what is it you want to talk to me about?
That's not the point.  In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't.
Of what?
That's because I'm on my back.
I'd like a little more conviction..
Can you think of a better one?
This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much.
You don't trust me.
Just about..
Why?  What's happened. What did you see?
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
Like?
Twice.
What did you think of him?
Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers?
Go to bed with a man and lie to him? She's a woman.  She's got all the training she needs.
You mean it'll be difficult.
That simple, huh?
Nyah still on the property?
Copy.  She's only got twenty-eight minutes left.  Track ahead and pick her up.
Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there I can make on!..there it is.  I've confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work!..
Whats Hunt doing on the TGV?
Hes putting on a show, Barnes.
Course he did.  Just exactly when he knew is something of a question.  Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan?
Now we dont have to eliminate him?  You like that, dont you Claire?  Dont you?
May take a little time.
We got it.  On your feet.
Don't move.
Take off your God damn coat!
No one sent me!  We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --!
Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me.
I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.
What kind of help?
You didn't have to.........
Yes.......come here....viens pres moi...
We've lost enough agents for one night.
Why was there another team?
Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
Yes, the mole's deep inside. And -- like you said.  You survived.
I see you've been out visiting the folks.
Profitable.
Now I want you to hold onto it.
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.
Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
I wouldn't dream of it.
I wouldnt worry about him.  Once youve got the money -- hell find you.
My contact is extremely shy.
Roger that.  Opening doors now.
Jim we cant.
Tell you what?
Ethan, you <u>can't</u> burn out.
He's our guy.
About two hundred yards from the bridge.
Yeah.
Whats going to make him do that?
If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me. Ill have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train.  Marcel Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in Paris.
Hello, Mr. Castorini.
Bed.
You've got to come. You've got to give me away.
I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
That don't sound like Johnny. Where's the ring?
They are little stars and birds. Birds fly to the stars, I guess.
What's wrong can never be made right. 
Maybe I should come back another time.
No, I want you to see this! I want you to watch me kill myself so you can tell my brother on his wedding day! Chrissy, gimme the big knife!
That's it.
Bus hit him.
Fast.
Instantaneous.
Me neither.
All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny.
I've got you.
Alright. Alright. There will be nothing left.
I've never seen a moon like that.
Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!
I'm telling you you can't.
But that's cause he don't know!
That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
Awful?
I think that's it.
You are guilty. I'm guilty.
You're late!
This is where we're going!
Yeah.
He's coming.
Good! We can get this out on the table.  I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother. 
Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.
Hi.
Johnny.
She was too young for him.
This is a good suit.
How about a month from today?
You've made me very happy, Johnny.
WHAT?
Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception.
Upstairs. Johnny Cammareri showed up last night.
Oh God, that's too bad.
I know.
I know.
My son does not like this Johnny Cammareri. He says he is a big baby.
My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay.
I will. But I must find the right moment.
I came right from the airport.
A miracle. Well, that's news.
That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
No idea.
Johnny...
Sure!
That woman was a student of yours?
Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
I'll remember that. What do you do?
Go ahead.
Good night.
Marriage is happy news.
What would he be doing down there?
So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around.
Bring her forward.
Does wood sink in water?
It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.  King of all Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!
I am...  And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot..  I must speak with your lord and master.
Through ... We found them.
What do you mean?
The Bridge of Death? ... which leads to the Grail?
All of us are ... we are all Britons.
Oh!
NI!   NI!
A what?
You must return here with a shrubbery or else ...  you shall not pass through this wood alive!
One that looks nice.
Cut down a tree with a herring?  It can't be done!
None shall pass.
'Tis but a scratch.
You're a liar.
Come Here.
Come, Patsy.
|      It's not working. You're not doing it properly.  Ni!
No.  No.  No!
It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
Well ... I AM king.
Oh, very nice. King, eh!  I expect you've got a palace and fine clothes and courtiers and plenty of food.  And how d'you get that? By exploiting the workers! By hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the social and economic differences in our society!  If there's EVER going to be any progress ...
Yes, I see.
... but a two-thirds majority ...
I'm averting my eyes, Lord.
Well, don't. |      I really don't know where all this got started. It's like those miserable psalms.  they're so depressing. Now knock it of
... Well, we did do the nose.
Ah ... but can you not also make bridges out of stone?
I feel happy... I feel happy.
My name is Sir Launcelot.
What is the capital of Assyria?
Ninepence.
Why?
Farewell, Concorde!
Oh ... that's awfully nice.
What - the curtains?
Listen, Alice ...
Leaving the room.
Got it?
Look, it's  simple.  Just stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room.
Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him.
Okay.  Fine.  We'll remain here until you get back.
And make sure he doesn't leave.
No, I want you to stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room until I get back.
No, It's nothing!
Camelot ...
Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
No, no, we must find the Grail.
No, I'm not.
Well ... yes ...
I am, sir. I am a Knight of King Arthur.
Yes!  With a herring!  With a herring!  Cut down with a herring!
Look.  I'm warning you.
Shut up.  Oh, nobody really. just passing through.
I'm not sure I do, Archie.
They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?
I've got my duties to attend to.
Oh, I'm much more than that.
I don't think I've had that pleasure.
I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?
Out of my way!
It's so infernally cold in here.
You'll talk when I'm finished!
I'm sorry?
I need a man who knows where I am.
You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it.  You know that very well.
No.
Well, you tell Her Majesty from me, if her husband was here now, he'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her.  What the hell's the point in me being here otherwise?!
I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.
I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused.  She has always had a very healthy sense of humor.
In as much as the article is about yourself, I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you.
We are all of us subject to forces beyond our control, Mr Brown, even you.
I wouldn't know.
Her mind is set.  She won't change now.
The threat.  I tell them, but they don't see it.
They aren't as watchful as you.
You are here safely.
I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish it.  The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank--
Then why send me back to them?!
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
Is that not enough?
We'll see which way the wind blows.
Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?
Who?
A few days...  When he heard, the Prince of Wales threw the bust from the window of the Royal Gallery.  It took four hours to gather the fragments.
Sure.
I'm coming over.
Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's doing it...
Quiet.  I do have parents, you know.
Sure.
Laurie's.
It doesn't necessarily mean she's...
Let's go around back.
They made ARCADE.  It's still a game, right?  It thinks like a game.  Maybe it still has to play by the rules. Someone had to program it in the first place, didn't they?.
Drives 'em crazy every time.
I know.  It sucks.
Got it.
Right, then...
Well, it's a long story...
I'm thinking!
Not yet, honey...
In case things get too intense.  It automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather.  Things can get pretty wild...
The game will guide you.
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
And?
I'm just offering a place to stay.
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.
How...  how'd they know I was here?
Unbelievable. Look... here.  I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?
You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
I told ya.
You got it! See you later honey.
I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.
Can you tell me what happened?
But it said #12.
I think I've been hurt.
Oh...
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
Come on... let's find you something to wear.
I know you're afraid of something. We'll be careful. Tomorrow we'll go over there and we'll find out.
You've got to eat something. You're just nervous about going over to see if you're Diane Selwyn.
Hey, let's introduce the brand new you to Hollywood. We haven't seen the roof garden yet.
Yes, Sir.
Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
Oh boy.
Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?
Palmdale.
Damn, that's a long drive.
Sure.
Where's the dock ?
I'm not fucking him..
Not listening !
Excuse me ?
Okay.
Hey , Hey !
I don't help criminals.
You were one of those guys that played Dungeons & Dragons with real swords, weren't you.
Swimming, you know, like in water, moron.
Thanks...
Don't have to tell me twice.
You've got to be kidding me ! His lazy ass couldn't win the special Olympics.
When I think you're ready.
When will that be ?
Excuse me, sir ?
Have you ever considered running your own "Park" ? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former profession.
We can't.
Yes. I think he's feeling sick or something.
It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?
Dinner at my place then ? Say, seven o'clock ?
Sure.
Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.
What the hell kind of cop are you ?
What ?
Zach from work ?
Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.
Look, Miss. I know you're still upset about that incident in Chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business. We don't have time to play nursemaid to every single Tom Dick and Harry.
Oh, just put it over there.
No, no, no, I gave it up ten years ago...actually it gave me up.
Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.
I don't think you're very polite.
Don't mention it.
I would do it again in a minute.
You're still asking me to break the law.
Suspended from school, my mother??
His name is Jeffrey Pommeroy and he used to drive a 54 Ford pickup, black with red interior. Please?
Pommeroy.
Could you hold on for a second? 
You want me to move?
Well not far, just down the hall. Plus Grammoo's room's a lot bigger, and you get a view of the whole neighborhood.
Well you know what I mean.
What??
I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.
She is not a child Harry, she is a young woman, she's on the brink of...
Phil's moving to LA, Grammoo's passing, the baby being born, Vada's report, I think...
I was pushing as fast as I could.
I remember Maggie...and your Dad too, you know we used to all pile into his old 54 Ford pickup. &quot;Chuck the Truck&quot; we used to call it.
Does she?
Well...
Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them?
ehh...I don't know I mean....
Well...I'm not supposed to talk about it, but since I'm gonna write about it I might as well tell you. She was a spy against the Russians.
Well if it isn't Vada, the grasshopper girl.
It's no problem, I had a mother once myself.
If you're selling Girl Scout cookies I'm borderline diabetic.
You're so clever.
I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?
What, you think the guy should change his name?
At least it gives you plenty of exercise.
Don't force it, you'll break it.
DON'T, come on!!!
Oh no?!?!?!
What do you think?
Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.
Well I know you're not crazy about taking Vada around tomorrow, so...I just want you to know I appreciate it though.
Rose this not the place to be having this...
So does that mean that you sleep here every night?
I'll do better than that. I'll send you off with your own private guide.
Sounds like you're very organized.
I'm saying he asked me out for coffee, like a real date, when was the last time you did that?
Is that a yes?
All right, well get to bed early and don't let anybody in. Bye.
I was commenting on your hair.
Sort of?
Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.
Well you've gotta be prepared.
Who didn't? She could play basketball like Jerry West, she danced like Sid Cherice, then she'd look at you with those big blue eyes, forget about it. I asked her out a couple of times but she always said no.
Once you put the hotels on board walk and Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.
Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy.
I'm impressed.
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
No.
What Hurts Vada?
Stiffs??
Pardon?
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it.
Harry, I really think she.....
Okay.
It's only eight o'clock.
I'm looking forward to that.
I know that, but what do you want from me?
Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, &quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.&quot;
Ya, that rack holds six ties.
They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
Any more soda left?
Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
She likes to play bingo.
There were just too many of 'em.
I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.
Really?
Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute.
Will you tell her I came by?
This is one big house for one single person.
Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this summer, so, I'm doing some work.
Vada, this is an adult writing class.
No he wouldn't, I can't go home.
I...I was gonna bring her to class next week. I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada, Vada sweetheart don't.....
Do you think she is?
Cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house, and you know that saying, If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if she's one of them, she won't be as scared.
Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.
Yes it is.
It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.
Well you don't know that. Ask him.
No, I'm divorced.
I don't want, I don't need your help....
I will I promise.
Goodnight.
I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
Yes.
It's my mother.
I told you i'll get in trouble.
Bed wetter!
Duck!
Pointing There's a beehive right there!
You're right, let's knock it down.
Sure.
They're getting married?
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
Okay on the count of three.
Umm, Ummmmm
I'm just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective.
Part of being a New Yorker.
Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w...
I can see why.
Because I realized.  When I see him say "I do," that knife will be in my heart.  And it will be there every...
I wish.
I'm moving this book to Viking.
Good girl.
I think the best part of marrying this guy is finding you.
I can be quick.  I can even be funny.
Can you watch the road?
See.  Dry.  It's in the delivery.
Uh.  How about promoting a bridesmaid?  Someone you know for at least forty-five minutes.
After two weeks of cataloguing all his faults, I made a command decision that changed my life.
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
No.
You win.
No, this happened to me once, almost, it was excruciating!
Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...
That's entirely understandable.
Right.  And then it didn't want to come off.  Exactly.
I hope so.  This is all too mysterious to waste on just me.
I know Ben.
I can't wait for you to meet her!
Mirrors.
Such as.
She's too genuine.
I switched that around when you weren't looking.
Except for that.
Me either.
I'll check.  I have it on powerbook, these days.
"Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down..."
"Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl."
Get married, apparently.
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
Well, it happens.
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
This is where I proposed.
It's two weeks.
Well, forgive me for screwing up your plans!
Damn straight, it's how I feel! What's their wedding gift, a little gold collar that says "Mikey-poo"? Or do I have to change my name to "Binky"?
... I'm partial to the tight end.
I don't want to listen to her sing -
Then why are you listening to her -
You have to what?
How did you come in here?
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
Well, I just thought I'd call.
No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
Third party?
D.C.
D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there?
When is it?
How come?
Haven's not going to talk to me.
I think we can do that. Come in.
Who's that?
I haven't gotten into politics yet. I'm still into music --except for you. You're into politics.
Need a ride?
Oh... Well.
Oh, well, I knew that before you- even left. I told you, 'Kenny, that old Nash won't make it down the road.'  But you had to go.
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
Fungus?
Bye.
Yes, it is --
Well, can you tell me why?
No, I don't.
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
That's not quite what I had in mind.
Well, they removed my heart last week, but I'm doing fine except my nose fell off. Looks a little funny.
Who is this?  It's Tom.
Oh?
I have to go.
Just got out. Had me thirteen lawyers. Missed the electric chair twice. .. Been out three months. Are you heavy?
What?
Yea.
Where's Bill?
I know a couple.
No kidding -- Wait till I tell Linnea. Who?
Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
You think I got any kind of a voice?
So, I think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that Bruce Lee, arguably the greatest martial artist of all times, developed for nine years, that would be a fella who could defend himself. Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?
What...
I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long.
Try to keep it to a minimum.
Are we in a big hurry?
When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?
I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
Lobotomy Bay?
You've heard of it?
Mickey's better half herself. Mallory Knox. This little lady drowned her father in a fish tank.
What?
Oh my God!  Sorry.
Yes.
Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.
We've been waiting to do a follow up episode on you for a long time. And that time has definitely come.  I feel it's apparent to anyone who's hip to what's going on that the prison board has thrown the constitution straight out the fuckin' window. You and Mallory may be killers, but you're not insane. You belong in a prison, not in an asylum. The prison board is blatantly railroading you into a hospital for the sole purpose of turning you into vegetables. Now some people are saying, 'So what?' I am not one of those people. If we avert our eyes while they do this to you, we give them permission to do it again whenever they see fit. Today they wipe clean your mind because they feel your actions are dangerous, tomorrow they wipe clean my mind because they feel what I say is dangerous. Where does it all stop?
We're about ready to go here. Are you ready?
Aside from the obvious?
Was massacring all those people worth being separated from your wife for the rest of your life?
No, Mickey, I can't let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year. Was it worth it?
Please explain to me, Mickey, where's the purity that you couldn't live without in five year old Danny Millhouse's blown off head? Where's the purity in forty-eight people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and Mallory? What's so fucking pure about that?
Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...
You made every day like kindergarten.
They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.
Survival of the fittest.
Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'
Rockin'!
How 'bout Mallory?
Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you.
Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more.
They got a asshole over here.  A asshole sitting down reading a magazine over there.  A asshole perched up there.  Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang stuff we'd need all those assholes, too. What we're about is intimacy. We're about two people having a conversation. Say I was interviewing you. All I want you to worry about is what I ask you. I want a trust to develop. If you're thinking about all this...  ...you're not going to relax, a trust won't develop, we'll be talking a each other instead of to each other, there will be no chance for intimacy.
Lose 'em.
Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I feel it.
I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but that's it.
Thanks, Duff. You' a nice guy. Not like Frankie.
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
All right, you get out of here, man!
That dyin's gonna be done two ways.
You' new here, man!  See you, boys.
Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
Okay.
Just so you do your work.
I don't know.
Yeah, I been there.
Oh yeah? That's good.
Okay, I will.
Yeah. On the section gang.
In Birmingham.
It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.
Well, either we're gonna hit the hay or get married. Now you don't want to hit the hay, and I don' want to get married.
Why did you?
Hell, I don't belong here. I don't know what I' been thinkin'.
Yeah. Well, I do.
No, I ain't married.  Well, good-bye.
Don't push me, Duff.
Well, what d'you think?
Am I as good as they?
Well, I haven't come around.
I keep thinking about him.
Like hell they can't.  They can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.
There's nothing to say.
I don't think that'll happen.
You'll be better off without me. I ain't fit to live with no more. It's just like a lynchin'. Maybe they don't use a knife on you, but they got other ways.
Like I said, baby - I'll write you.
'Round town.
Take it easy, Frankie.
What 'you signifyin'?
'Got a good thing, man.
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
Plannin' on getting married?
'Don't sound so sure.
I heard you.
Just tryin' to be helpful.
He's been hitting it pretty hard. Got high blood pressure, too. I guess it's hard on him, having you around.
Yeah, sure. Good luck.
Nothing you can do. Been like this for days.
It's just that I hate empty rooms.
Well, what're you going to do?
All right, son.
I see.  Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.
I know.
Hi.
Let's stay here, Will.
What's the matter now?
You hate Raoul?
Sometimes, I want to blow his fucking brains out!
Since when?
My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
What?
What does this have to do with me?
Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
I'd say you were full of shit.
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
Right. And no one would take on an A.I.... If they had a choice.
I know.  You ever work with ghosts, Case?
Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know.
Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
What about McCoy?
Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier.
The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?
Are you even really alive?
The words?
Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it.
What?
What?
Can you take me to it?
It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
I'm workin' on it, Bro. I'm workin' on it.
Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?
How long, Dixie?
It's coming.
You haven't got it?
The angels... I think they're calling your name.
Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
I'll give it my best shot, mother fucker.
Couple of months.
What about before that?
Okay fine. Let's get this over with.
Something exotic I hope.
Yeah. One exotic son of a bitch named Riviera.
That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
You're out of time, man.
Perversity, darling. The enjoyment of the gratuitous act. Tough to manipulate someone who doesn't give a flying fuck.
Professor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist.
How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
College?
Exactly.
Leave.
No Roger from op/ed?
Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy  If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.
Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
Have you been to any parties?
And that's the best part.  "Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it!
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
See!
No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.
Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!
Hear one.  Rob, this is so like you. You know, you can't just come in here and be popular in just one day.
I'm Josie. Geller. I think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. Josie.
I love the way she writes.
True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  Are you sure you're seventeen?
But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
Do you think you'll find her?
But now you don't have to--
I finally found my story.
The poem! I knew he liked the poem!  Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid.
We're very evolved.
Thank you.  I'm Rob.
Duh.
We went through the door...
Where?
No!
If you went away, what would become of me?
Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
I can't help it.
<i>                      That's the point of the thing, not to know!</i>
Oh, come on Dad...
There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.
I want him back.  Jesse, talk to me. Jesse!
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
They've only been trying to unload that dump for five years.  That place is bad news.  Some chick was locked in there by her mother and she went crazy.  She watched her boyfriend get butchered by some maniac in the house across the street. Her poor drunken momma took her own life right inside your front door.
He must've been working late and some fruitcake came in and sliced him up like a kielbasa.  In the shower!  Left bloody footprints all over the...
I'm scared, Grady.  I know it sounds crazy.  But, there's something trying to get into my body.
Yeah?
I just got here myself.  Went to the Public Library.  Cut four classes!
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
Make a left at this corner.
I don't know.  Where are we going?
Well, what am I supposed to do?
About what?
I'll get over it.
Oh, Jesse...
My Dad thinks I'm on drugs, my Mom thinks I'm crazy and I'm not sure I don't agree with her.
I'm not hungry.
I wish you'd talk to me.  We can figure it out, you know.  We can figure it out together.
Why won't you talk to me?
No, Jesse.  This isn't happening. It's gotta be everything you've taken in -- Schneider and the diary and the glove -- only it's all mixed up.
I can't!
No.  I'm okay.
I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks.  Any cute guys gonna be there?
I'm serious.
Don't "hi Mom" me.  What are you still doing up?  It's past one!
It's okay, I'm not tired.  Really.
I've been good.  When do I get cigarette priveleges back?
I -- I think so!
It's an amazing gift.
He's real.
You did it the other night.
You never lose a gift like that.  You just forget how to use it.  How about it?  Will you try?
Let's try this way.
So?
Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
Must have opened while I was away at school.
I'm serious.
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
Then maybe you're ready.
The truth.
There's only one man...and its time for him to talk.
What?
A sad choice.
The bastard son of a hundred maniacs. Some say he was murdered, though no body was ever found.
There will be no repeat occurences of last night's events.  From now on, your doors will be locked during sleeping hours.  We'll begin a policy of evening sedation.  For everybody.
I know what it is.  I just can't believe what I'm hearing.  What has she talked you into?
This is stupid.
Good.  You conquer the demon, but your horse is sinking in the bog.  What do you do?
Me too.
Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.
I'm not listening.
And then I... right.
I'm an actress.
Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?
Fifteen million dollars.
Right.  Right.  So that's... fairly good.  On the high side... have you tried the nuts?
Eighteen yards.  That's my house there.
Do you always say 'no' to everything?
Oh right.
Don't worry about it.  I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.
No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.
Right.  Great.  Classic.  Classic.
Yes.
Okay -- fine.
Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
Step aside.
She left me.
I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
My son's name is Johnny?
Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.
You think I should do Henry James instead?
No.  What's that?
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
Both.
Right.
No! No.  Wait.  I... thought you were someone else.  I thought you were Spike. I'm delighted you're not.
You disappeared.
Well... how have you been?
Thank you.  Shall I...
That's fine.  There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict.
I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
That's very good news.  The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted.
I'm sorry.  Is this a problem?
Nice surprise.
Nice one.  Would you like my phone number?
Crazy.  Go along Bayswater...
Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh Goddy God.
Do you want to stay?
I'm not saying it's a bad thing, in fact, I think it's something we should take pride in.  I'm going to give the last brownie as a prize to the saddest act here.
And we intend to use them!
Di Caprio.
How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.
Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, Martin?
But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
No, that's right -- I know that.  She said she's using another name -- but the problem is she left the message with my flatmate, which was a serious mistake.
That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.
Yes, she is fairly fabulous.
Hi...
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it?
And you get on very well.
Yes.
I'll talk to you in the morning.
Well, there are.  And we don't need to go anywhere near that far.  My best friend slipped -- she slipped down- stairs, cracked her back and she's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. All I'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective.
Let me help.  We don't want all this shit cluttering up our lives.
Yes.
Yes, ma'am.
Good. I'm sure we'll be friends.
Yes, ma'am.  Lead the way, Sam.
Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...
Sorry, ma'am.
How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
On this ward?
Oh, I had them removed.
What for?
Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
Jesus Christ, the man doesn't want to talk, so get off his back an' let's get on to some new business.
Yeah, yeah, the hell with that crap! The World Series is goin' on right' now an' that's therapy also!
He's into his wind-up. Here's the next pitch... and it's a hit! It's a hit!
Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.
B-B-Billy.
Some of us ha-ha-have b-b-been here a long t-t-time, Randle, and will b b-be here long after this Wo-Wo World Series of yours is oh-oh-oh, what's the use anyway...
Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
Wh-wh-wh-wh...
Shhh...
Wh-wh-where ya going, M-M-Mac?
Go ahead! Go back!
Marry who?
M-M-M-Mack?
Are they all crazies?
Wow! They're so quiet.
Whaddaya talkin' about? There's at least twenty guys in there. Let's wake 'em up and get this party on the road.
Let me get on your shoulders.
Where ya goin', Mac?
Shhh...
Right, Mack!
Me too...
I'm seeing what a busy man does.
Did to you and all the rest of you guys.
She ain't peckin' at your eyes, buddy.
What for?
No!
Can you borrow me a dime?
No. Me! Me!
Me, too! Me, too!
I'm hungry.
No.
Poker!
Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
It is worth considering... Miss Ratched?
Replacement coming in! Harding out!
Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
Yeah, you don't know how to get outta this place!
Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!
That right?
How's your ass been holdin' up, honey?
What?
On what?
That me an' my buddy, Cheswick, we'll be downtown tomorrow watchin' the ballgame while you suckers are sittin' around this goddamn nursery!
Hey, Martini! Psst! Scanlon! Ya dumb goons, come back here!  Come on, let's get 'em!
This way, Mister McMurphy.
Yes, ma'am...
Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
How 'bout twenty?
Jus' playin' the game, sucker...
Take you han's offa me!
At this hour?
Shhh... let's move it away from the window...
What's that?
Okay, ma'am, just a moment.
Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
Exactly.
Your great aunt.
No...
Except possibly that.
Dwayne?
A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.
Wait.  I have to write this down.
Faith, this guy you think is Mr. Right, he's... not what you think--
So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?
This is his fiancee.  Who's this?
Right.  Thanks a lot.  And congratulations.  It's not easy finding love these days.
Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.
I'm on my way to Venice.  Why?
You said whatever it was you would understand.
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
To the foot doctor.
Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
Who says I don't love him?...
Tell me.
You too.
I know the feeling.
Okay.  I'll meet you at the dock in ten minutes.
Who cares?!  You hired an actor??
No one had to tell me.  He's starring in the local play.
A "little white lie"?  A "little white lie"?
Tonight?
Any night.
Well, not exactly...
You would?  Really?
Mommy, this is Faith.
A few times.  It's kind of an annual tradi--
Yeah.  He's around somewhere.
Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
Well, I wouldn't've if I hadn't thought I was in love.
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know, like in the movies.
I know.  You're right.
That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.
Does Dwayne know about this?
It's called... the Gritty Palace.
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
So, maybe his room hasn't been cleaned yet.  Maybe there's something in there that might help us.  Maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around.
A phone message.  Only--
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.
Her brother.
You're right.  At least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself.  Smile.
Packing.
Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
And he is living proof.
Yes.  He is.
I don't know.  I've just been thinking... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation.  Maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for.
He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
Oh, hello.  I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--
Oh.
Giovanni.
Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
You said it differently then.
And you didn't tell her?
She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
That's all. Next witness!
This is for you to figure out. You can have it your way or you can have it his way.  But you can't have it both ways.  Am I right, Sonny?
Maybe he gave them an argument.
I figured the worst they'd do is work him over a little.
He probably gave 'em an argument.
Thicker than water.
Of course, the boys know you too well to mark you down for a cheese-eater.
Boss loader!
ex-tanker who's walking on his heels ?
Things 're lookin' up on the docks, huh, Jackie?
Now you got me! It's a wonder I wasn't punchy by the time I was twelve. The rulers those Sisters used to whack me with!  They thought they could beat an education into meI foxed 'em.
With a little more patience and kindness. That's what makes people mean and difficult. Nobody cares enough about them.
What?
How do you like that one?
I don't know.
How about another one?
Gee, thoughts! Alla time thoughts!  You really believe that drool?
Yeah, yeah... .  This Father Barry, what's his racket?
You haven't finished your beer.
I don't rate it.
I keep hearing it and I don't know what to do..I don't know what to do... .
I mean it, let's get away from here, first Joey then Nolan, now Charley and any minute... .  ...I'm frightened I'm frightened.
Terry...?
Take it easy.
Well, it'll be worth it if we can tell the waterfront story the way the people have a right to hear it. Don't you think?
Yeah?
Doyle.  Joey Doyle's... .?  ... .You're his... .
Keep the advice. Give me the whiskey.
Listen, kid, why don't you go home before Johnny... .
A dime, Terry, a dime for a cup of coffee?
Don't give me that coffee, you rummy. Now blow!
I do not joke in my proposal.
In there.
Then..then what's that music?
Don't let them hear you.
You're talking nonsense.
...And I thought you loved me.
Now, I will talk...to The Wolf Man...and The Mummy.
At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.
Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World.  There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the law--all powerful. <b>No one</b> is to challenge that authority, <b>no one!</b>.  Is that understood?  It is my command.
Hahh, there is always time... All in good time...there is <b>always</b> time.  You shall have your pleasure.  <b>THAT</b>... I <i>decree</i>
For what!?!
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
Aaaahhhh.
What do you suppose for?
Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about?
Who is it?
Did you know that when you married him?
Buddy'll take care of him.  Keep him out've trouble.  He's Jack's conscience. Always has been.  He tell you how they met?
Who are you?
Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.
Why don't we talk about it later?
She's coming with us.
He ain't the problem, Jack.
I want to talk to her again, that's all.  See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances.
You're right.
Oh, man.
I know exactly what you mean.  It's just a feeling.  You know, I could go for some wine tonight.
Sounds great.
He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you.
Two hours.
How long were you with the girl?
Let's drive by where we're meeting and have a look.  Maybe take a look at Ripley's place while we're at it.
Whatta you wanna do?
But you still think you can get the diamonds fore they do?
There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there.  We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale.  I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy.  If he does, you call me right away...
Sure, Daniel.
Now.  What is it you wanted to tell me?
Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to bring in Chirino, would you put me on the task force?
The manager's door is metal.
You told me I can come 'cause I caught you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you and Lulu coming out of the bushes, thought maybe you two were making out.
I appreciate the offer.  And it's tempting.
Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.
We're a few minutes away.  Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?
That's right.
Another C.
Glenn didn't tell you?
We're leaving.
In my bag, in the car.
You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
Must be quite a pal, risk his own ass like this.
Why, are you famous?
That's funny.
I believe you would have.  Another fall, I did seven years at Lompoc.  And I don't mean the place next door where some of Nixon's people went.
What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
Uh-huh.
Sure.
<i>Network</i>.  Yeah, she was good.
Really.
Uh-huh.  Well, but if --
I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
I just thought maybe you and me could--
Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out...
I'm just going to the bathroom.
I don't know about that.  You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.
You just did, for Christ sake.
Studs.  Man, I haven't heard that since Lompoc.  What's going on?
In the trunk?
Why?  Just because you left us standing on the side of the road?
How many?
I do, but I won't tell you just yet. Meet me in the chapel at eight-thirty, right before lock-down.
Must be a real soft pillow.
Any time.
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.
How are you, Richard?
Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
If that's my fate, so be it.  I'm not leaving.  I love her, Jack.
For a time.
I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
Hejira.
We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
Jesus, I don't believe it.
Jesus.  How'd you know about Snoopy?
I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
I don't have to prove shit to you. The Ripley job is <i>my</i> job.  You're either in or you're not.  You wanna pop some crack dealer pissed you off, that's your problem, not mine.
No.  You gonna stay close to me from now on.  So you don't disappear on me.
Oh...
You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
You wanted to tussle, we tussled.
He said he stayed here last November.
He said he stayed with Maurice.
Got run over by a car.
I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater.  He use to take me.
Oh, he's moved out?
Hello?
Not at all.
I didn't have time.
I told you, he isn't here.
Out for the evening?
Foley's got it.
How would I know.
Too late for apologies, Walker.
Where's that lizard?
The one that slept in my mouth last night.
Mai-tai's.  I got this to tell ya, about mai-tai's.
Of the four left, only one is full of fuel.
He did.
Then why are you looking for her?
What's there?
They're coming around for another pass. You got extra weapons and ammo?
What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?
Bullshit.  We've played with each other, pushed each other.  This is different. Like you want to prove that you're better than me.  Who's that for -- Evelyn?
Longer?  It's getting shorter.
The brass is afraid of sabotage.  This makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service.
Were.  Isn't that what you mean?  Were. Because he's dead, isn't he?  And that's why you've come.
He told me about you.  That he had no other friend like you.
I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
That might not have been such a good idea.  They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield.  The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.
Well...sure.
From the air?
The navy will get us to within 400 miles of the Japanese coast.  We'll launch off the carriers from there.
We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne.
I have a phrase I want you all to memorize:  "Lushu hoo megwa fugi."  It means "I am an American."  In Chinese.
Thank you, Sir.
Thank you, Sir.
I was hoping to meet him.
I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay.  You are okay, aren't you?
Brilliant, Admiral.
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
God help them.
Goodbye, Grandma.
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
He does?
Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today.
Would I?!! Why I oughta...
Good.
It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.
Why?
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
You're going to listen to me.
You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, "Peggy, you're scared." Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless.
Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades!
Take a long walk on a short pier.
That's a day's work. But if that's what you want, maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday.
It must run in the family.
A writer's life is his work. Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. He's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life!
Hey, man, I'm a hip chick.
What are you shooting for?
For everyone.
Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.
What a treat.
Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause.
Evelyn, put her to bed.
Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
Quiet today?
Wrong, Dad. Your idea.
Oh no!
Didn't call, them pantyhose, though. What was it, Evelyn?
This is not giving blood. This is drunk.
Sort of.
What about?
I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
He's a liar! He has no such thing! It's my own fault. I should have had it patented first. He's a crook, damnit.
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that.  You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
Dancing with you.
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
What if it's beyond science? What it it's God?
I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fiftyfifty.
Come on. You can't be serious.
The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
High tech. I like the sound of that.
Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip.
There are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes.
--Drew, he's your dog. Are you listening to this?
I had a little run-in with Zowie.
He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious...
It's been a few years.
Nothing. I just got spooked by a bunch of furballs.
I still can't believe she's dead...
Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He got hurt again. I'm going over to take a look at him.
I'm going out, Dad!
"Out." Well that's great, Geoff.  Look, I've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but I'm not going to stand for crap like this. I don't care if it's Halloween... it's a school night, and if you do this again...
Stepdad. Gus is my stepdad.
Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
You'll never find it in the dark.
What's wrong with your face?
We're not skipping this treatment.
Close the law book.
More than your friend. Family.
Honesty is always best.
I'm seeing him this afternoon.
Uh, yeah.
Congratulations.
There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.
I suppose you could say that.
Can you explain <u>why</u> you didn't?
No.
As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?
And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.
No. I can't really see it.
Are you on one of those conference calls? I hate when you put me on hold.
Objection.
Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
Fact. Andrew Beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level. Fact. He made a grievous error on a multi-million dollar lawsuit... Fact. He claims he is the victim of lies and deceit. Fact. Andrew Beckett lied to his employers, going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them. Fact. He was successful in his duplicity. The partners at Wyant Wheeler did <u>not</u> know Andrew Beckett had AIDS when they fired him...
I'll withdraw.  You were aware, when you worked with Maria Torres, that she had AIDS, correct?
Right.
Uh.... No. Not really.
What's the matter with you? Do I look gay to you?
Since when?
Okay, Joe...
And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.
Like firing Andrew Beckett taught <u>him</u> a lesson?
So you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise, is that correct?
I <u>know</u> the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.
I felt, and still feel, nothing but the deepest sympathy and compassion for people like Maria, who have contracted this terrible disease through no fault of their own.
Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
Very good, Joe. Now, Belinda, I've got a figure over here, of one million, five. I...
Holy Shit. Did you, Bob?
<u>What</u>?
Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.
The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta. What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt, so I used it to catch a little run-off. Metallic taste to it, human blood. Coppery. But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. Course, that's more for winter. Summertime, I take mine straight.
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns.  Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.
I asked what <u>you</u> thought.
Actually...  That's what I been askin' myself.
What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. With her bleeding.
You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
What, you're afraid?
Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was <u>his</u> monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see.
Awright. So maybe we'll have enough light.
You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
What?
Like my pistola.
I assume he licked it clean.
Thought you didn't believe his story.
Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts.
Wait for what? Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to --
Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
What the hell's it matter?
How much?
We're just burnin' light here.
I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? Huh? Is there anything at all? Besides your next hype?  Got no right to be so scared. Neither one of us.
When captain went down, you stepped up -- whether you like it or not. Now they train you for this, so --
You mean....
Blessing you like the others.  It's painless.
KEEP GOING OR I WILL!
Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now.
Wanna rag your fat mouth?
<u>Trawl</u> with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.
Well, what's the need, anyway? If he's gone, he's gone. Why should he bother us?
So much for my cocktail hour.
You still don't believe me, do you?
Right now, if you like.
Yo!
Any sign of dangerous ionization?
What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.
They're still dirty. And their bite is septic. Look at that ...
Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet.
Very well. I suggest we go and look at them.
Huh?
We're some three hundred and twenty light years from Earth. On an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion.  That could be Bellatrix.
Sorry...  I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?
By our time.  You've turned gray.
There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
Oh, and one last item. Immortality. You wanted to go on forever.  Well, you damn near made it. Except for Dodge and me, you've lived longer than anybody. And with Stewart dead, it looks like we're the last of the strain. You got what you wanted, kid. How does it taste?
A man, Dr. Maximus.
We're -- conducting a new experiment.
My name is Taylor.
Then why is he called the accused Your Honors must think him guilty of something.
Identify him, then. Speak to him.
Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
I don't know.
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
Taylor, you can't.
Why not?
Do you believe him?
What?
In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be.  I'm sorry.
That reminds me, I gotta take a shit.
Shaddup bitch.
Youse so fucked up man.
Hang tough, Gator. Hang in there, man, you're gonna be OK... just hang on.
You're wrong man! Any way you cut it Rhah, Barnes is a murderer.
Yeah. How 'bout you?
Dawn...
...don't feel like it either.
...beautiful night.
Yeah. I love this place at night. The stars... there's no right or wrong in them, they're just there.
Barnes believes in what he's doing.
Yeah, those are the guys that live. I really don't think Death gives a shit, it's like a giant garbage can, I think it takes whatever it can get... you never know where it's gonna come from anyway... so why spin your wheels?
Yeah, just stole me some from the Top's supply but he's stealing it from us anyway.  Chucks are coming. You better 'didi' man.
You WHAT? Say 'gain.
...there's nobody.
Does a chicken have lips? Whoever said we did, babe. Make it outta here, it's all gravy, every day of the rest of your life man - gravy. Oh shit, superlifer!
Forty-two days man and a wakeup and I'm a gone motherfucker. Back to de WORLD. 
Maybe but I seen it happen at Ia Drang in '66, First Cavalry and they cut us to fuckin' pieces!  Give me three men, if I'm wrong, I can still roll up that flank.
Found it. Growing in a garden.
Sheeit, beats burning hutches anyway...
Yeah, you done said it. Revenge on US.
This is one time we could sure use Elias.
Well..

Don't get me wrong, Betty. I'm not suggesting you murdered anybody, you know.
Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash.
Nobody I'd rather have on a leash.
If I change my mind.
How careful should I be?
I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.
I'm Mr. Campbell, Miss Mayfield.  Purely as a matter of routine, I want to ask the name of your bank.
Disgusting, aren't they? If you really want a Martini, I know where you can get one.
No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff?
You're drinking it.
Do you think I don't?
Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.
Just who are you, anyway?
I didn't notice him.
He was following us--but he's not a policeman.
Anything I can do about it?
Nothing matters.
There's another man--right outside the booth here.  I never saw him Before.
Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store.  With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  Perhaps you're right.  Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.
That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?
Yes.  I've never been very far from it, for a long time.  Will you do something for me?
But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
Killaine...
It did, but it never paid off-- until now.  I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway.
My father died in jail, and he was twice the man I am.
That, and the fun of it.
Including Killaine.
Including Killaine...I still can't think of you that way.
That man that was following us last night--he didn't come back this morning.  I'm beginning to wonder about him, too.  Was he really following me--or you?
And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
Beer?  Well, all right.
Miss Mayfield, the humor of the situation escapes me. Within 24 hours I shall know officially whether Mitchell was murdered. Privately, I'm quite sure of it now. It happened in your room, and you came to Vancouver with him.. At any rate, he made your hotel reservation.. And you arrived together. Here in this room he behaved nastily to you, and you said something to him which might be taken as a threat.  A few hours later he was found dead on your balcony. Would it be too much too suggest that all these circumstances taken together are a little suspicious?
Who told you I was married?
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets.
Yes.
A graduation present.
Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
I've never been to Florida.
True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
We try to be decent.
You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector.
Very ridiculous.
Goodbye, Betty.
And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.
I'm not sure I want anything from you. You might want something from me.
I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.
Fascinated.
Leave that one lay.
The new ones are fine. The last set I had gave me all kinds of trouble.
Delightfully. Every time Miss Mayfield says something, I know less than I did before.  Well, I may as well knock off for tonight.  Good night, Miss Mayfield. Do let me thank you for your cooperation.
Sure.  Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.  How long since you saw her?
That COULD BE TOLD.
Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.
How could Mitchell?  After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?
No idea.
Where would she go, anyway.  Don't tell me you haven't got her covered.
I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners.
Don't bet on it. I'm eccentric.
A little something on account perhaps?
I'm afraid this is all for the moment.
Oh, shut up!  You haven't even got your spats on.
He was very easy to hate. If you'll look in your mirror, when you are in a better temper- you'll know why.
Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.
You told me when we'd identified this fellow--
Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.
I understand.  Pity to mess up a nice clean boat.
Would you?
It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
Sounds like a fair swap.  Let's take a look.
I'll know when I find it.
Market... It seems to me that's a San Francisco exchange.
If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.
You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.
And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.
And a motive--which we haven't got.  So this could all be a dream.
How did you know?  Clarendon.  You cops never tell anybody anything, do you.
Not if it clears the air.
I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--
Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
I'll take your word.
She's the only one who had a dead man in her room.  The only one who won't give an account of herself. The only one who tried to run away. And the only one, so far, I've been told, who went to such lengths to disguise her identity that she even removed the labels from her clothes.  What more do you want?
But you still think she's innocent.
Two.
Who's the girl?
What does it look like?
Right.
It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
Be nasty.
I see.  Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield?
Yes.
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
If we leave the remembering to historians then the struggle is already lost.  Everyone must have a memory, everyone needs to be a historian.  In this country, for example, we're in danger of losing hard-won freedoms by dozing off in a perpetual present.
Penfield.  James Penfield.
Very good.
I'll suggest it.  Remember though, we're news, not features.  It might help if you could get yourselves attacked by the police.  Anyway, I'll be back with this soon. Thanks.
And some of that.  Sorry.
I think it went on rather too long.
Both dead.
I have to be up early. 
Did she talk about me?
I haven't really thought about it.
No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
In your car
You're so hard.  All right then. I was chatting to some people from the diary page, and the name of Barrington came up.  I expressed an interest...
Mmm...
We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
Well, everyone's desperate for a new Falkland's angle.  Purdy's come up with a real dog.  Worker's rights in Argentina.  So I've been running round getting people to do things.  But no one's keen.  Workers rights.  When did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers rights?  I said to Purdy, "Look, tits, bingo, jingo, horoscope, sport, celebs, gossip and the occasional firm stand on--"
I've known Susan for more than fifteen years.  James, we're old allies.
I'm waiting for your mother.
Well, she doesn't complain much. You know what she's like.  She keeps asking when you're coming...
Well, it's worth seeing.
She said that?
It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?'
'Night.
No.  So I was up the beach.  I saw it going down.  you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world.
Thanks for stepping in.
Come with Tyler.  She knows.
I've watched you once or twice.  You surf like it's some kind of street fight.  You jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you.  Always trying to win.
Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
You do it... you first!
You first!
See!  That's what I like about you, man!  You're just sharp as a razor blade.
But you're not alone.
Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can I do for you?
Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over.
Naw, you pull it!
Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big.
I take the skin off chicken.
Fine.
What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.
Shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a soil sample.  Non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax.  So I became a wax expert.  There's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products.
Why can't I just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned?  Ask a few questions.
Okay, Dad.
Got it.
Bodhi, yeah.  I'm on him all day, right.  He goes here, he goes there, he goes to Tower Records and buys come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's Road House...  ... he goes into the Assured Trust Savings and Loan.
Yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a higher plane of existence, or something.  Maybe he has.  You've seen him surf... that frenzy.  It seems like anger.  It's not.  It's the energy of lovemaking.  The sea is the woman in his life.  She's his only true lover.
But you look like you been in a train wreck, how'd he just drive away?
I'm telling you so when you look back on this moment, you can think... there was this guy named Utah and he was pretty much a dork but maybe not such a bad person and I let him drown in conditions he had no business being in whatsoever... when I could have easily helped him.
Well somebody sent them.
We're going to need everyone.
What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
The best friend I ever had.
It's been a long time, General.
Someone else will be going in with you.
Well... I might be going out to dinner.
You'll want a cocktail dress then.  Turn.  You have a beautiful figure.  A little too out in the open but simply lovely.  Size six? Do you need shoes?
Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
Thunder's a horse.  Come on.
You what?
You've got a lot of nerve.
I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.
Yes.
This time I imagine you would, yes.  Hmm...  With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can I?
Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
Sit-and-spin.  Alright... why not?
Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
So do day jobs.
Just a romantic, that's you.
Don't drown.
I'm in town until Saturday.
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?
This isn't a date.
The Rex.
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
Uh-uh.  No work.
Dinner can wait.
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
Stuckey!  He wants an "appointment" with me after you leave.  You my pimp now or did he think that up on his own?
Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know.  That's the fun of it.
It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
I'm sorry.  That's very sweet, Edward, and I know you mean it...
Yes.  The man made a business decision.
It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money.
It felt good.
Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.
Yes!  And you don't even know where you're going!
Oh, god, what?
Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?
Let him answer.
Have a good day, gentlemen.
That crack is burning a hole in your pocket.  There isn't even milk in the fridge.  The rent's due.  Now come on --
I was asleep.  You woke me.  You okay?
Yeah.
Go for the bucks.
No.  You took care of rent, that's enough.
Of rent I do not bullshit.
Okay.
They were real nice to me there. They treated me, y'know... nice. Thanks, Barney.
Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever been there?
Actually, some of the richest people I know have the worst manners.  Of course, Mr. Harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table.  All right now, pay attention please.  Salad fork.
Certain ladies make that very easy... Vivian.  John, call a limousine for our guest, please.  Have it take her anywhere she wishes to go.  Bill the hotel.  See you again sometime soon.
I'm just looking, thanks.
I don't think it would fit you.
I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place.
Do you remember me?
No, I'm sorry, I don't.
He is a sailor on the pirate ship "Revenge." Promise to return him to his ship.
You're a silly girl.
Why not? You can't hurt me. Westley and I are joined by the bonds of love. And you cannot track that. Not with a thousand bloodhounds. And you cannot break it. Not with a thousand swords. And when I say you are a coward, that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth.
Of course you will.
Hear this now: I will come for you.
Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.
No. No. We have already succeeded.
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
Did you say, "I do"?
You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?
Why do you wear a mask? Were you burned by acid, or something like that? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           39.
You never said anything about killing anyone.
Anybody want a peanut?
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
It's you.
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
I have a little.
I just hope it's enough to buy a miracle, that's all. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           91.
Yeah. It's really good.
Nothing gave Buttercup as much pleasure as ordering Westley around.
-- wait, just wait --
Keep your shirt on. Let me read.  Westley had no money for marriage. So he packed his few belongings and left the farm to seek his fortune across the sea.
My spy network has heard no such news.
The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.
I always think everything could be a trap -- Which is why I'm still alive.
Not yet.
I thought he was with you.
-- offer me everything I ask for --
If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26.
You are ready, then?
There will be no arrangement --  -- and you're killing her!
What you do not smell is called iocane powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man.
Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
You only think I guessed wrong --  -- that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool.
He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
An hour.
What?
He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...
"He wants to croon, he wants to croon,
"He's gonna croon love's tune,
Well, sir, it seems ...
I'm sorry ... I don't like people touching my blue blanket.  It's not important.  It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and ... and ... I find it very comforting.
You keep saying that, but you don't tell me how.  How could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit?
Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made your error.  You didn't go all the way.  You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.
Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?
Mr. Bialystock, not more than five minutes ago, against my better judgment, I doctored your books. That, sir, is the ultimate extent of my criminal life.
Aaaaaaaaaa!
How's this? 
Coney Island??
I ... I love it.  I haven't been there since I was a kid.  But it's nearly two o'clock.  I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I'm a nothing.  I spend my life counting other people's money -- people I'm smarter than, better than.  Where's my share? Where's Leo Bloom's share?  I want, I want, I want, I want everything I've ever seen in the movies!
I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it!
Max, what is it?  What are you doing?  What's happening?
OI.  I'm depressed.  Leo, do me a favor.  Open the safe.  I want to see the money.
I'll show you.  Ulla, go to work.
Why don't we go over to the theatre and see what's really happening? After all, we've only heard from a small portion of the audience. Let's hear what the majority thinks.
Mr. Liebkind, wait ...
With whom?
Really, I never dreamed ...
It was the same thing in Germany. We looked for years before we found the right Hitler.
Never mind.  Listen.  Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer.  Why?
You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?
All right.  Finish the job.  Let's get outta here.
Call chauffeur.  Get car.
Good.  Good.  We go Motel.
Get car.  Get car.
Thursday.  Thursday.  We'll play Thursday.  We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.
Oh, Bialy, please, just a little. Just a little.
Ta.  Ta.
Oh, I'd better hurry back.  I don't want to miss one minute of it.
By the sacred memory...
The Graf Spee...
Heil you know who!
Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.
We can't... we keep our money there!
Heil, baby!  I just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.
We won.
Groovy!
Back where?
Cash or check? For the cabin...
I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...
I live there. Alone.
I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
That's all right. maybe she could have fooled me.  But...  She didn't fool my mother.
Casharoonie!
Sam, if she's here...
I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...
But what?  Is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen... my car?
I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do.
Her sister's going to do that.  She's as worried as we are.
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
With the forty thousand dollars?
I don't know.
May I talk to you?
Where?
Don't you know?
A good reason, I suppose.
Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...
I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
He's the Deputy Sheriff around here.
Of course we will.
There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
What makes you sound so certain?
The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean!
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...
And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?
All right.
Sam, let's go get married.
Norman Bates.
I imagine so.
It's not as expensive as you'd think. Cheap, really. Needles, thread, sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything. 
Very early. Dawn.
Alright, Miss... 
Is there?
I'm sorry.
This place! This isn't 'a place.' It's my only world. I grew up in that house back there. I was a happy child. My mother and I... we were more than happy.
And now that your mother's dead?
Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it...
...Forty thousand dollars!
And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
This detective was out there and Norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away.
What--special autopsy?
Maybe you want my money, too.
Dr. Meirschultz, too?
You're not as quick as I thought. I figgered out that rats breed faster than cats-- cat skins make good fur-- The cats eat rats. Rats eat raw meat. That is, they eat the carcasses of the cats. So --the cats eat the rats--the rats eat the cats. And I get the skins--simple ain't it?
Oh, Maxwell? He's left.
Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.
Mind if I look around? Seems to me you have car- ried on some interesting experiments. Sure of himself but taking no chances. MAXWELL Sure, I'll take you thru.
No, you can't do that--they'll get suspicious--
Joseph returns from the room where Gisle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
Why didn't you eat last night?
Yeah, but they leave you plenty.
Well, I do say it.
So that's the way it is?
I'm glad you told me. Good night, Mr. Burton.
Thank you.
I'd love to, at any time.
At any time. You will always be welcome.
You mean he was colored?
Great. Consider yourself crippled -- financially. See if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on.
Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 
Now don't that call for an extra!
Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
What do you mean -- haywire? You start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. You start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You're grand! I'm for you! Stupendous!
Where were you going when you got in that cab?
I don't remember. Not so very far--
No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.
What do you mean police dog?
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station.
Heaven knows. A lot.
That is unfortunate.
But I have some friends waiting.
All right, I'll tell them. They're right here in front.
Quite so. Quite so.  And you, my little friend, my little Marie Antoinette. It is kind of you to be present.
Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.
Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
Well, any time I can do anything for you --
Dad...
Inside every semi-conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier...
Is Rose here?
Well, I got to see her.
I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.
What'd you do, Rose?
Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?
Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you.
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
Well, nothin'.
Rose, if you don't keep your boyfriends away from the house, Daddy is going to fire you.
You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat.
Yeah, I'd believe it.
Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared.
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
Quiet, you little muddy-eyed brat, or Ill kill you!
Well, yeah.
No. Why should Rose be in my room?
Well, it's not very plain.
Well, I don't know.  No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it.
No, you didn't say that, Brother.
She's getting herself up to go out.
What'd you say, Brother?
I'll be right back.
I can't see, let me see...
Boy! Wow!
You shouldn't watch such things, Doll.
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose.
I know. You loved her. So did I. It was an awful shock to me, too. An awful shock. Rose was so alive it's hard to believe.
It's true, son. The girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more,
Now look, boy, get a grip on yourself. Rose had a good life. She found her. Right, didn't she? She triumphed over everything, what are you blubbering about?
Go on, Doctor.
I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
All right, darlin', don't go off into the fourth dimension.
Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home.
You're a wonderful woman, darlin'. As long as you're around, I'm sure the sun wouldn't dare go out.
What time is it?
I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.
Honey, please...
Something has got to be done or Rose is going to be in this house forever.
I forgot that Rose will lie like a child. She's no more pregnant than I am, she just doesn't want to go to that farm!
Well, I know, more so. That's why I was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.
I'm afraid it's my fault. I made her feel guilty this morning --  Brother, what are you doing up?
Who?
If you've got time before you go "out," get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup.
Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours.
Yes, sir.
I don't believe it.
Perfect, wonderful, good as I ever felt! Except for a big old scar on my stummick, I wouldn't even know I been in the hospital.
What was it, Mr. Hillyer?
That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet.
That's correct -- outside it, not in it. As for the job, well, the Jewboy suppliers give me a lot of grief and we use a pile of niggers to haul and tote and they ain't worth a sorry-ass damn.  But I can build anything, Buddy. Give me the plans and I can build a goddamn staircase to the moon. It's a fact, I can build anything...  ... but she never believed that. Oh, hell, no, she never believed in me.
You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I.  You'll have to admit she had four husbands.
Ah-h, if you happen to run into Rose sometime... do me a favor, give her a message for me, will you?
Oh, to hell with it, never mind. Don't tell her anything. Don't even tell her you saw me.  Got to run, Buddy, I'll miss my plane.
She looks terrible, just awful.
I am thinking particularly of the other ovary. As a rule I don't believe in removing it. The woman's hormonal system is profoundly disturbed, she is subject to possibly serious depression, she loses many of her secondary sexual characteristics for example, her breasts might shrink and become flabby, facial hair might appear along with a coarsening of the features, and of course her sexual drive is greatly diminished, especially in a girl or young woman. For these reasons I am opposed to removing the other ovary, as a rule. Do you follow me?
Well, she has one mouth in ten thousand, I don't see teeth like that once in ten years. Her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth, but there isn't a cavity in her head, not a single one. She has perfect teeth.
I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me.  You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
No, ma'am, I'm just fine.
Oh-hh, ohh-hh, Lord, he's gonna kill me.
Yeah, it's kinda nice.
Forget about it, I don't want you working in one of those honky tonks.
And who do you suppose he is? That policeman who arrested me, the one I bit! He is Mr. Right!
I was going to tell him.
I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.
Am I supposed to take this information and sit up in the hills with a frickin' telescope?
Fair enough.
Abe Lincoln...
Well... we shouldn't rush into this, right?  Let's talk about it.
Stop blaming yourself.
Wh... what... ?!
I don't know.  I could quit now if I wanted, I just don't want to.
Dean Martin.
It's not gonna happen.
Wha... ?
Bullshit.
It doesn't say that.
What was I supposed to do?
You'll cry like a great big, blubbering baby.
Just keep an eye out till I get this rig up and running.
Then, why'd we tie him up?
If we don't catch a break soon, we're gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.
... where... where's a jerk like me ever gonna find another girl to love him... huh?...
We've got the tape to prove it.
I'm here.  That's all that counts. Watch... you'll enjoy this... it's like magic...
You mean taking bribes, and skimming busts and letting hoods walk? You mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest Joe?
Don't bother.  This behavior's gone on too long.  You're suspended.
Till the last firework fizzles out tonight, detective, you sit a desk. And, after that, I'll decide if you keep your shield.
Look out!  Jupiter and Saturn'll get you every fucking time.
Second of all, the Declaration of Independence was all for liberty and equality, but it didn't do anything about slavery, did it?
"Go, go, go!"  "Slow down."  Make up your mind.
Can't be worse than you.
He's right.  We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.
I worked my ass off for my badge, Kittle,  It's the only thing that makes me different from every other slob out there.
All for one...
Out here.  On your knees.
Just got here.
Seatbelts fastened, please.
When you bunch it together, it's exponentially more powerful.  Two sticks have the power of four sticks. Four sticks have the power of sixteen, and so on.
I don't think so.
It's one of a kind.
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
I can't kill my own father.
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
Fine. Together again, huh?
Wouldn't miss it.
Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.
I gotta get you out of here.
Charges!  Come on, come on!
You love him, don't you?
I'm trying!
Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.
You, too.
Come on! Come on!
All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.
You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.
I will not fight you.
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet.
Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing.
Janet.
I've one thing to say and that's Dammit, Janet. I love you.
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
Uh huh.
Dammit, Janet.
We must have a blow-out.
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.
Weiss.
Oh don't be so shy.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
If only we hadn't made this journey. If only the car hadn't broken down. If only we were amongst friends or sane persons.
You must leave now Dr Scott while it's still possible.  We are about to beam the entire house back to the planet of transexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. Go now.
Oh my, my,
Smile and that will mean I may
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Oh, lucky him.
They didn't like me.  They never liked me.
...Goodnight, Rocky.
'Cause you can't sing or dance?
You sure?
I think he might be worried.
I don't think I belong here.
It's all right -- You're my guest.
They either say, 'Kill the nigger' or 'Hope you die, Honky.' -- What ya got in the bag?
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
Yeah...
What did you say about a pet shop?
I don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more.
Yeah, I can't beat him.
Paulie, it's Thanksgiving. I've gotta turkey in the oven.
Only a pig would say that!
...I don't feel heat from the name.
I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
No doctor!... I'm feelin' good, bro!
Very high an' very fast.
Still to be held in Philadelphia?
C'mon, man, it's cold, man.
Why?
'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar.
Six!
Charge it.
Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.
I agree.
What's happenin' here?
That's it? -- Completely?
...Fine.
Hey, screw ya brain on right. Now, who's this girl you're going out with tonight?
How'd you know?
Paulie's sister.
Listen, kid, I'm with ya. Ya know, I'm with ya -- Italian, we're blood. You kill this rug -- We Guinneas gotta show these Afro-Americans where it's at. Give it your best shot cause I want ya to prove to these bums on the corner that my man can't be beat by this rug... Ya got any action on the side.
Same thing. Ya know, Rock, remember when we was kids, we fought together. An' I wasn't well an' ya had to beat up that Irish kid -- what's his name? -- Gallager -- I bought a suit and became a businessman. You put on gloves. An' I remember Mama almost cried, may she rest in peace -- an' our ol' man who said ya had no brains --I'd like to lay hands on that bastard. You ain't never had any luck. Even when I owned you in '66 you never had luck. But now I think you might be gettin' some luck kid. Whatta you think?
...Thanks.
No -- Just me.
Excuse me.
I'm sure you are.
I wouldn't take no cheap shots. I'd be a good sparrin' partner.
Come July, twenty-five.
Hey, ever think about retirin'?
...I said that before.
I never had good footwork.
Would you keep goin'?
Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
Creed's great.
The owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago.
Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
My sister's a friggin' loser.
I'm thirty myself.
Let's get outta this stink.
I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.
I didn't want no turkey anyway.
Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh? Nobody -- I think I'm gonna train myself.
Keep this job, ya eat better.
What?
To see ya train.
...It's cold outside, Paulie.
Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?
Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.
Listen, I wanna say hi to my girlfriend -- Yo, Adrian!
Somebody took it from him.  That's what this whole thing's about.
Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
Sounds like you ve never seen her, Eddie.
You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
Maroon, right?
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?
It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was my idea of how to put the land to better use.
Not for long.  We're retiring the Red Cars.  People will drive, Mr. Valiant, because they'll have to.  And when they drive, they'll have to buy our cars, our tires, our gasoline.
Toons aren't given imperfections.
I didn't know who I could trust.
When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
What a gasser.
Jesus Christ... <u>that</u> was the Judge?
One too many safes dropped on his head?
Maybe.  Why?
That was the idea.
No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had nothin' to do with Acme gettin' killed.  I just wanted to sell my studio.  But they wouldn't buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.
No, I don't.
Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will.
Get away from there.
Yeah?
Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
Only time will tell.
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
Teach me how I should forget to think.
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
Hold Daughter!
Benedicite! What early tounge so sweet saludeth me?
I have been feasting with mine enemy, where on a sudden one hath wounded me, that's by me wounded; both our remeidies within thy help and holy physic lies.
O, she new well. Thy love read by rote and could not spell. Come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove, to turn you household rachor to pure love.
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
O, mighty is the powerful grace that lies in plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities: for nought so vile that the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give, nor aught so good, but strain'd from that fair use revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse: virtue itself turns vice, being misaplied; and vice sometimes by action dignified. Within the infant rind of this weak flower poison is resident and medicine power: for this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; being tasted, slays all senses with the heart. Two such empossed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs, grace and rude will; and where the worser is predominant, full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
Mercutio's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company!
That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men's noses as they lie asleep; Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees, Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This is she--This is she!
True, I talk of dreams, Which are the children of an idle brain, Begot of nothing but vain fantasy, Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes Even now the frozen bosom of the north, And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence, Turning his face to the dew- dropping south.
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
A Plague o' both your houses.
Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.
Of course.
I don't want you dead, woman, I want the the truth!
Which leads us to...
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission?
I didn't say I was.
Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in here!
Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
Should any of you decide to rush me, I'll kill myself and whoever happens to be near me at the time.
Shut up!
He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now!
Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.
I think not.  I have, of course, taken the precaution of wiring the briefcase to explode five seconds after it opens.  Unless, of course, I deactivate it before it goes off.
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
What's that?
Nobody's going to do that!
I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.
Forgive my intrusion into your affairs, but I am the one who connected Vincent to this job, his agent, if you will.  He is one of my oldest friends and I owe him a great debt, much like the debt I suspect he owes you.
I got a surprise for you, blondie...
Who's they?
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
Who you calling dumb, dickless?
You should learn a little patience.
I don't.  But the language he's speaking is universal.
Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable.
It has it's moments.  Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
I just wanted to see something.
But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
This doesn't involve you, don't you understand?  I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.
It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
You see the bullet?
I know of him.
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
It's a cover, then.  A cover within a cover, a feint within a feint.  You work for the CIA, it's the only possible answer.
I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.
You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead. If they had the package, they'd have killed him.
Something like that.
It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto.  Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not?
And now...
What of it?
You better get some sleep, alright?
I'm sure.
It's the Irish tape we want.
Why don't we step into my office...
All depends on whether you want the Russian or the Gaelic language version.
Dwayne listen to me -
We don't know that.
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
Well, I don't know.  I'm putting it out of my mind and you should too --
That's not what I mean.
Well, we didn't know that at the time.
It's the right thing to do.
I can't do that.
All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.
He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not.
Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.
It's gonna be o.k.
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
Do you have everything?
Rock solid.
Why don't you get to the point.
I'm all ears.
You're only screwing yourselves over!  Helllllp!  HELLLLLP!  SOMEBODY!!!
HELLLLLP!!!!
I'm just tired is all.  I'll see you tonight OK baby?
I'm in here.
He's not, he's...
Speaking of which that reminds me I have to bring something home or eat Sally's meatloaf again, and I don't think I could stand that.
Because they don't want anyone to hear what's on it, obviously.
Mm-hmm...
I mean at least pick a more discreet place, the scalp, under the armpit, under the tongue, someplace where the trained eye wont immediately look.
Yeah whaddya want?.
About what?
Well I'm here now.
Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind is all.
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
Yeah let's hear about your day.
Well I got the tires rotated, I went shopping, and I made dinner.
You'd do this to me!
Is that the mail?
At least around here it does.
Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go...  Hey -- I've got a surprise.
That's great Earl!
Money.
Yeah, we did.  It was unleaded, high octane.
I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!
Do you know what happened yesterday, Carter?  I was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. There was a dinner last night, two hundred LAPD officers were there.
I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. That's a Ferrari.  Do they sell those here in the gift shop?  Somebody cash me out!
Last party all he wanted was Sting -- not one person danced.  Tonight I'm doing Superfreak, I don't care what he says.  Where is he?
How'd you know?
I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?
Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
That's Chief Inspector, he got promoted.
You pick any girl for you and your friend.
You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
You better take one.  Your breath has been a little funky all day.  Let me look at you.
Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun.  Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.
Well, hurry up.
Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
I'm okay, you go.
Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
Ask me if I give a shit.
Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign.
It's a long story.
Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
What's going on?
No.  It's not right.
Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
It's your turn!
Take it!
We can help you.  I'm a detective in Hong Kong.
Shhh, my head hurts.
Why did you help me?
I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  They don't let everybody in.
Mind your own business.
How was the sex?
They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.
Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
MMMMMM!!!!
I did!
Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
Come on, Lee.  Stop being a cop for five minutes and live it up.  There must be something you want.
Amen to that, brother.
How do I know I can trust you?
We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.
It's my responsibility.
Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong.
Ricky Tan?
The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.
It's a massage parlor downtown.  "Heaven on Earth."  You will find your answers there.
No.  He will report to me.  Do we understand each other?
That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The detective in charge of our investigation.
The bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity.  If you want the Ambassador's daughter back alive, listen and do not talk.
They asked for the best street man I had.
Tell me about it.
No.
I am not responsible for your assumptions.
Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.
It was not my intent --
Shortcut?
What plate?
Did you make the plate?!
Bullshit!  You were trying' to lose my ass again.
Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama.  So where the hell am I from? Kenya?
Yes. He was part of the Juntao crime family. He may be Juntao himself.  And he dropped this.
Who does not know War?  War, hhh, Wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh.  What is it good for?  Absolutely nothing. Good-God, you all.
Yes, I think so.
It's him.
I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.
The art.
It's okay. For restaurants.
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
I'm the town's unofficial fitness trainer.  Big advocate of the mind and body combining for success.  You could say or you can quote me, I'm a glass half full king of guy.
You bet ya, Coach.
Hold it!  Hold it!  I think we're taking this too fast.
I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
Got any last minute advice?
What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
He's here!... He's here!
"Sink the putt."
I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
So?  I never returned your calls, even when we were married.  And what's Fisher doing here anyway?
I already made an appointment for later today.
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
This is good.  It is a good story, Fish.
But I'll get my normal fee, right?
Oh yeah!  I happen to know from reliable sources that Nietzche got expenses and a rental car.
No, I'm paying for the dress.  Do you think she's still gonna run?
Unbelievable, she got to you.
Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
You know, your daughter seems...
Gotta tell you this about my daughter. My daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels.  Maggie may not be Hale's longest running joke, but she certainly is the fastest.
Excellent.
Six-fifty.
Cindy the manicurist.
I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
Still sweet.
And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
Something that brings warmth to my heart.  Duckbill platypus.
Would it?
... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it.
Not eight...
No sauntering down the aisle.  Just make time.  Let's just get there.
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
Maggie, it's just a joke...
A harmless joke.
No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room.
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
Is there somebody else?
What am I going to do with a microwave?
He's got a houseboat.
I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
I love you, Walter.  Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?
Nope.  Not even when I was young.
What is it?
-- it was a betrayal.
Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
Yes.  Some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony.
Whatever it is.
"Dear Sleepless and Son..."
That's impossible.  A guy can't --
Turn on your radio!
The kid is on.  You've got me listening to this garbage. Go on, turn it on.
Definitely.
Thank you.  I love you.
Well, it's the same woman.  And he was crazy about her.  What is this?  This is from Seattle.
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
I want my money.
And you crazy? He thinks shows like this are dumb.  If you didn't have an 800 number I could never get away with this --
Yes.
Yes, I did.
Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom.
I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
How amazing.
It wasn't a sign.  It was a coincidence.
It's a sign.
Magic.
Why not?
It's not that late in Seattle.
Fair enough.
Tell her how you don't sleep at night.
Well, okay.  What's the big deal?  If she'll forget the new fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the right direction.
Great.  They'll have a parade in your honor.  You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine.  Tira misu.
I'd rather die than eat on an airplane.  I'm telling them you're twelve so you can fly unaccompanied and they won't make you be carried around by a stewardess and everything.
There's somebody on the phone for you.  His name is Sam.
No, I'm not, but --
Stressed.
She's willing to fly anywhere.
Jed's got cables.
What was?
I miss her.  What do you think happens to someone after they die?
The one who wrote us.
This is the one I like.
Did not.
We ought to start camping again, Dad.
Thanks, but... we've got plans.
It'll take him a while to come around.  A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --
Hi.
I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
I've already solved it.  I've hired a hit man.
You haven't tried locking them up!
I don't make policy.
It never ends.
Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.
Anglo husbands can also be backward.
I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
Alone?
You talk of dignity? After what you've been doing?
Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. "Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican" -- that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, "Stay in your place." Do you feel better having someone lower than you?
Will you be still?
Maybe not. But there's another thing ... like when you came in tonight --  I heard you ask your wife, "Who's that? His grandfather?"
The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.
You Judas ... blood-sucker ...
No.
You like that?
I'll have to live with that.  My money my risk, my rules.
I don't know .... you could be staking your financial future on stealing Bob Hope's stool specimen.
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
It's not that easy.
Why not?
Because he'll kill me.
Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?
Don't worry. He's out of town.
And you admire that?
Find a new job.
Why?
Hey, you did the right thing. You wouldn't have stood a chance against these boys by yourself. They have eaten your ass alive.
It's Tom.
I know it's not my place to pass judgement on you but ...
I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred.  Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like?
Guess it's our turn.
I hadn't noticed.  I've seen you around.  What's your name?
Finland is a country.
I'm serious, dude.  You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'.
I find myself in dire need of some cash.
10%.  That's ...
Good for you Jimmy.
Secret recipe.
Make me an offer.
Anything for a dear friend.
Big Bill.
I didn't fucking do anything! I swear to God!
What?
It was all pretty informal.  Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries.
The money? The drugs? Keeping yourself out of jail? I know the drill.
When?
For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
No. You just handed us a new one.  We can go Federal on your ass right now: ongoing criminal conspiracy. Intent to buy and distribute $250,000 worth of crank.  What's the mandatory on that, Al?
Whata you mean?  He told me -
What's he holding?
Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood.
No.  You've got me all wrong.  I mean, in you own pussified way, you actually got some nuts in your little sack.
No.  Right here on the beach.  Come on. Let's do it.
Okay, okay.  There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions.
Now that's scary!
Good work, Flynne.  You're a first-rate rat.
I thought you were done.
Sector four is secured, we put out the last three German one-fifty-fives, found them about two miles in from Ponte du Hoc.
In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer.
Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
I am, but I like imported whiskey. So there I am and I hear the biggest ole' coon you ever did hear, 'a rustlin' right there in front of me. That ole' boy comes right out of the brush, I got a clear shot and he knows he's 'bout to meet his maker. I aim, I got my finger tight on the trigger and then I just smile and say to that ole' coon, go on, now, you get out 'a here.  Then I sit down on a hollow log and take me a right long pull a' that mash whiskey.
You didn't volunteer, Jackson.
I most likely would have, sir, had I been given the opportunity.
Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.
Say what, Cap'n?
A half-track, anything.
Like I said, it was nothing.  Don't bunch up.
I heard.
You know classical music?
The men said, nine.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.
Beasley's dead.
Yep, hell of a mission.
You got me.  Afraid of bad news?
Nope.
Nope.
Is it getting worse?
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?
It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.
That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's Ryan?  If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose?  Look at my hand, there it goes again.
What are we going to do?
We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.
Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen.
Trust me, you're the best.
Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?
Easy for you to say, sir.  Fucking James Ryan, I'd like to wring his fucking neck.
I'll make a note of your suggestions but I'll leave that last one to you, especially if he's already dead.
Well now I'm saying we're moving out.  Get off your ass.
Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
That's a mystery to me.
See to it.
OPENS UP with the MACHINE GUN.
More tanks...  Ryan Lot's of them The fear on their faces turns to resignation.  They know that they are dead men.  They settle into their positions, and prepare to fire and die.
This bridge cannot be held.  The Germans have two companies less than three miles from here.  They have tanks.
Struggling with a pair of Germans.
And Sarge?
Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
I care.  Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?
Get lost.
This evening is over.
That's right.
Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together? 
I'll take the whole set.
Good thing there's not a red line on you, J-man. YEAH!
I still am.
What's a scam?
Going out as friends.
Diane Court doesn't go out with guys like you.  She's a brain.
Please?
If she wants me, she can come to me.
You're an inspiration Lloyd; you should go on the seven hundred club or something.
If you were Diane Court, would you honestly fall for Lloyd?
I can accept that.
I'll put this past my boss
Alright.
Alright, no more, I'm going to save it.
I won?
Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
Dad.
And then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around.
You bet you should have called.  You still live at home.  Don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.
Dad, I'm so sorry.  I know this is a bad time.
Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
You're not listening to me.
Swear to god.
No.  I told you everything, you lied to me.  I would have done anything for you.
No, I will.  I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you.  You're a liar, and a thief.
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
Yeah?
Busy?
Are you busy on Friday?
Y'know, you're not in England yet, you know that of course, and by the way, I want to just tell you that I lived in England for a few months,
Would you hold this for me?
Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.
Bye.
Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
I know you think my job is strange.  You don't like old people, do you?
Okay, bye.
Okay.
Yeah.  With potential.
No.
You're shaking.
I don't know.  I'm happy.
Your letter came yesterday.
How do you know what I'm going to say?
We'll see.
No, I don't, I don't.
Lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share.
She figured it out.  I'm sorry if that upsets you.
What is that?  What are you doing with your hands?  Talk to me, you're talking like that girl Sheila.
Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
I know.
He's back.  Hey my brother, can I borrow a copy of your 'Hey Soul Classics'?
Oh.  Okay then... Lloyd Dobler, 555-1342.
Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?
Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.
Are you going to England with her Lloyd?
That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.
I know
Very talented.
I know this part, keep reading.
She can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better.
What?
This is great, this gives me hope.  Thanks.
Wow, man.  Well.  Listen man, I need you to be the keymaster.
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
I am happy to say that this bag is officially empty.
Oskar, please -
Well, you've been through it.  You know. You could make things easier for me.
I pay you too much.
I don't know.  Soon.
You did, but you didn't.
All you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you.  What's a person worth to you.
Yeah.
How should I know?  It's broken. See what you can do.
Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.
Whoever.  They're the ones.  They'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me.
Simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think?  Change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you?
The war could end.
Christmas presents.
Thank you.
Oskar -
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.
There's taking money and there's taking money, you know that.  He's taking money.
Take the neighborhood.
Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...
Did it?
Did you do it?
Good for you.
I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
Sid, you don't have to.
What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
No. This is a set up.
Youre not going to get away with this.
He hates Oliver Stone.
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?
And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
What are we looking for?
Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.
That's not the way we play the game.
What if your life depended on it?
It's good to see you involved.
But who would operate your camera?
I dont know.
Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way.
Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight.
Don't do this.
Hello?  Hello?
I'll cover you through rehearsal. Derek when do you get outta docu- drama?
The crowd is really with the movie. Some even talk to the screen. "You dumb bitch. Get out of the house." etc.
The young girl is slashed again.
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
We've set you each at a five dollar quota.
Gee, let me think. "Do you want to..." Is that the best you can do? Some tired hand me down rehash? Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. No movie rights. Nothing. I've been through this before and much better I might add.
Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.
Thanks.
Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you.
Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president?
Please, call me Gale.
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you see what I see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted. I think you know about that.
Yeah. A real tragedy.
When it's a threat, you'll know it.
Sid, get in my car. You're coming back to the station with me where it's safe.
Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
What?
Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers!
Sid I want you to stay here! I'll be right back! I'm not gonna let them get Gale!
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!
It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?
Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.
Nevermind, what'd you two find?
Honestly, my life.
Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to a Tobe Hooper flick.
Oh shit it's my cell!
What the hell are you doing?
Here's how I see it.  I've got no house, no movie, no gun, and I'm being stalked.  Because someone wants to kill me?  No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I go where you go.  That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you.  Make sense?
Bitch.
Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies.  His two hands, dingus.
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been cut into McNuggets.
Make-up. You need it.  Hey, Roman isn't here?
I thought you wanted me here?
It's good to see you again Sidney. I was growing real impatient. Go ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later.
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
I'm sorry, your voice.
Piece of cake. She'll be there.
I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
Yeah...
Where the fuck did she go?
What are you doing here?
Hey, hey, it's just me.
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
Ssshh... everything's gonna be okay. I promise.
What?
I called my dad.
We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something.
To apologize.
They've got 900 numbers for that. Seeya.
Who is this?
Do you like scary movies?
Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
What do you think I said?
Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
Go to the back door and turn on the porch light -- again.
Guess.
That all depends on you.
Then he dies. Right now.
Which is it?
It's an easy category. Movie trivia.
Then you should know Jason's MOTHER -- Mrs. Vorhees was the original killer. Jason didn't show up until the sequel.
Deputy... good evening.
Then what are you doing here?
Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.
Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.
Sidney's father?
We gotta get back. Jesus. He's here. What the fuck is he doing here?
You can't be here, Tatum. This is an official crime scene.
Yes, you doofus.
He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd cast Tori Spelling.
Not yet.
Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?
Not my daughter... not my...
Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out. Takes a man to do something like that.
She's saving herself for you.
Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie Lee was always the virgin in horror movies. She didn't show her tits until she went legit.
Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one.
Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food.
The official term is "psychotic".
What happened?
Whatever. Just hurry.
Just like old times, ain't it?
I want you to meet me here right after class, okay?
I don't know...
I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.
He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night.
You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
How does that get you in the mood with Stu?
I did. He's full of shit.
Tits -- see.
Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
It's always been like this.
In two months, no one's going to even remember this happened.
Spit it out.
You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off.  That's all.
Innocent?  Is that supposed to be funny? Look at the people I killed.  An obese man, a disgusting man who could barely stand up... who if you saw him on the street, you'd point so your friends could mock him along with you.  Who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish  your meal.  After him I picked the lawyer.  And, you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one.  This was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster... to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets.
A woman...
Murderers like you?
A woman... so ugly on the inside that she couldn't bare to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside.  A drug dealer... a drug dealing pederast, actually.  And, don't forget the disease spreading whore.  Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face.  That's the point.  You see a deadly sin on almost every street corner, and in every home, literally.  And we tolerate it. Because it's common, it seems trivial, and we tolerate, all day long, morning, noon and night.  Not anymore.  I'm setting the example, and it's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed, from now on.
You're going to be remembered, and it's all because of me.  And, the only reason I'm here right now is because I wanted to be.
Really?  Just biding your time, then? Toying with me.  Is that it?  Letting five people die until you finally felt like going out and hauling me in?
Shut up!
I'm here for the same reasons as you, I guess.  Or, at least, the same reasons you used to have for being here before... before you decided to... quit.
Let me tell you how I want this to go.  I want you to look, and I want you to listen.
What?
I don't know.  Feel free to look for yourself, okay?
I just don't think we should have that sort of relationship.  We'd start quarreling over insignificant things.
Can we talk about this in private?
Hello.
I read.  Remember reading?
I just have to say, I can't respect any man who's never seen "Green Acres."
I vaguely recall a large, angry man, and someone called Norton.
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
We put her in a safe house.
Okay.  But, what?
I'm, sorry, but even the most promising clues usually lead only to other clues. I've seen so many corpses rolled away... unrevenged.
I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.
Oh, it's alright.
A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue.
Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh?  Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...
How do you know all about this?
The Divine Comedy.  A History of Catholicism.  A book called Murderers and Madmen.
That's what it says.  Jonathan Doe.
Who told you about my silver tongue?  You been talking to my wife?
I'm fine.
You can't go in there.
Think about how we got here!
We had him.
Looking around... I've got a bad feeling these murders are his life's work.
You're the oldest man I know, Somerset.
Wrong!  I sympathize completely, because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you... you become like John Doe.  It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it, because it takes so much work to love.  You just have to make sure you don't stop to think about the abuse, and the damage, because you'll risk being sad.  Keep ignoring.
You're talking about people who are mentally ill.  You're...
What are you talking about?  What happened?
I can't let you do this...
Why is this painting hanging upside-down?
Oh... um, William.
What?  Oh, yes.  I mean, thank you.  Please, sit down.
I guess I won't be showing it to him then.
It surprises me.  It really does.
I'm sorry, I only...
Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
It's not a sword, ma...It's a sabre!  Did you kill many damYankees with this sabre, Uncle Ethan?
Huh...? No...no water.
No sir...pleasure.
Just keep goin'...
You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.
You got it with you?
And maybe you lie...
Huh...?  Sure I'm all right...
Must've...Anyway, I ain't goin' back to look for it...
Get some sleep...Tomorrow's another day...
Good night...
He just couldn't wait...
Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!
Comancheros...
You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
That means Mister Futterman is dead, by golly.
Wouldn't bother me...  I wouldn't try it in front of pa, though, was I you...
Shush!...Time for bed anyway...  Likely these'll need some takin' in...Oh, Martie, you're that gaunted! ...Ma's havin' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and...
I can't help it, Laurie...I just gotta catch up with Ethan...
But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...
It isn't fair...
You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!
Oh God, Tommi...
Not a book fair.  I was signing autographs in a department store.
Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen.
Why not?  She can guard the house. By the way, I gave her a name: Clara.
I went to see Prof. Roth!  You know, I had another one of those dreams last night.  I saw Tommi!
An animal?  What kind of animal? A goddamned T-Rex, or what?
...So he's dictating you a new bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's not our son.
Thank you.
We can do all of that later, but first you need to calm down.
Peculiar?  You mean, like back then?
Thank you, Ned.
You have the money?
Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
A goodly length in times past, but lately
Who is that?
Put his feet in.
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
Mr. Fennyman, I think you may have hit on something.
I don't know. It's a mystery.
Oh, it's coming, it's coming.
Nobody knew!
What happened to Sam?
God be praised!  Locked?
Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
We are about to embark on a great voyage.
You want to know what parts you are to receive. All will be settled as we go
God's teeth, am I to suffer this constant stream of interruption?!  What will you do in Act Two when he meets the love of his life?
What do we do now?
"Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?"
Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
Will you ask Her Majesty to be patient?!
He looks well enough for a mountebank.
Speak out! I know who I am. Do you love stories of kings and queens? Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?
I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
They are not acted for you, they are acted for me.
Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts.  How much was the wager?
"Go ask his name--If he be married, My grave is like to be my wedding bed."
"Madam!"
You left it in my bed. Come to look for it again.
I would have made you immortal.  Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by Will Shakespeare.
"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
I like her.
So this is the favour you find in the Chamberlain's Men.
I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter.
Oh but why "alas?"
Well perhaps better than my first. 
It was the owl--come to bed
Let him be damned for his pages!
There is time. It is still dark.
In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature.
You cannot marry Wessex!
"It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east. Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I must be gone and live, or stay and die."
I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
I don't know. It's a mystery
I have spoken with your father.
Do you intend to marry, my lord?
She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.
And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.
Killed last night, in a tavern! Come, then, we'll say a prayer for his soul
If you love her, you must do what she asks.
Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat.  Is your lady beautiful? Since I came to visit from the country, I have not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful?
And her voice? Like lark song?
For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
Christopher Marlowe at your service.
Just serve.
Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
I'm only asking you both to think about it.
No, not that.
Then what? Who's going to do what?
We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
I won't be able to.
Oh, that'll come in useful.
You're not eating.
But more laughter than tears, I think? Yes. On balance? I mean, remember that time when -- oh, we could talk all night, but we have to go. Don't we, Juliet?
Where do you think you'll go?
Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.
Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, we're short.
I've never seen any of these men before.
What?
Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
Just one thing.
Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people should know that.
Well, she had problems --
-- I'd be the first topoint that out. In all kindness I would. But, like they say, you know, she's got to want to change, hasn't she?
Hugo.
All right. No problem.
What? What's wrong?
No.
For ever and ever.
No, I don't.
He's right. You'd feel much better about it.
Your painful groin?
It's the only way.
Alex.
Yeah, well, that's what she said. Interesting. That's why you're here, you see.
Well, that's what I said, isn't it?
No, nothing, sorry.
Two hundred pounds.
No, no, no. That's what you paid for it. Two hundred pounds is what you paid for it. We don't know what it cost us yet, for you two to have a good time, we don't know the cost of that yet.
Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
That's right. You're going to Rio. Rio de Janeiro. On your own. Come on, you should know. You bought the fucking ticket.
But they sneer, don't they?
Yes, sir.
A priest who dies.
Writing seems easy.
Did he sound upset?
A little bit. Is that good or bad?
For what?
The human condition.
I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
And what do you recognize, names or faces?
I suppose so.
And you said you supposed so, but I wasn't offering it for debate.
Look, would you argue with your doctor?
Maybe... why do you ask?
Yes, but... I thought...
No, doll, I listen to you. And if a deal loses money that's not so bad either if it's handled right.
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
Can't we go into this later, sweetheart?
-- yes, we're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in, believe it or not.
What are you talking about?
Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
Wow.
But you don't know what happened.
What?
I'm coming, baby --  How's Otis doing, anyway?
We have this political thing tonight. Could you comb me out at the house?
Hey, listen, baby, I'm a star.
I don't know. Just a minute...
Don't be silly. I'll just tell Lester we were smoking a couple of joints. See?
That headboard.
Hungry?
You're my mother's hairdresser?
What?
You don't have to make conversation with me, I'm not my mother... do you have a thing about older women... that's sort of faggoty isn't it?
Yeah...
Beverly Hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that's funny too?
They are?
Pardon me?
Devra, try Jackie Shawn will you? And if you don't reach her, keep trying.
Can't you do it out here?
You don't seem very sure.
Okay.
No... Lester likes it on all the time in case he wants to use it.
Well, did you or didn't you?
One of my few virtues is discretion.
-- why not? C'mon, take me out of here, somewhere I don't have to lie to anybody and I'll fuck your brains out, you little fiend, I adore you --
You always say that... I really care for Lester, don't I?
-- what?
Nothing.
-- last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.
-- well you better go after her.
Well then what are you trying to do-
So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me.
Don't leave me...
I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.
I'm busy, man.
I don't know if you don't know --
-- yeah, this is --
Okay... thanks...
I don't know... every once in a while I just get the feeling something awful's going to happen.
Now, George --
What?
I am, I am. But I've had it with chicks. They're like an occupational hazard. Six guys working for me... I'm gonna retire or settle down or something.
You're great.
Hey, baby -- I'm gonna retire with you.
Why am I great?
Okay...  Night, baby.
George?
Hey, baby, what's happening?
I'll call you.
Who?
Look at the way I live.
I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?
Oh, honey. If we had one place, we could have a nicer place and I could take care of it. We're almost never here.
Commercials.
Who knows, I'm sure you don't -- but if it'll help any, I found it in your bed.
What difference does it make?
Does it make you happy?
Yeah, I know. Did you?
What did you say?
You need a cut.
No, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything. It's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am I right or am I right?
Oh yeah.
I know it, I know it.
Layered?
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.
Oh Jesus Christ.
What can I say!
We're always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don't like it... that's just how it is... look, it's got nothing to do with you, man. It just happened. Felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to PTA meetings?
Well, I don't know.
Yeah, the clap. That's what she thinks. But who knows -- I don't know.
Wasn't sure it was you.
Awww --
What was it, somebody's daughter?
Is that right?
Then you were talking to him.
I ran into him at the 76 station on little Santa Monica, what was I supposed to do, hide in the ladies room? Yes, I was talking to him.
No.
Oh yeah?
See you later.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
We don't think marriage is important.
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
Well, you know what I mean.
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.
-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
Is he an enemy?
My God, did I say that? I don't believe it.
He's a hairdresser.
-- his car. They have it blocked.
Jill.
Thank you.
-- just wonderful.
Three weeks.
Do you have something against traveling?
Oh, say, how would you kids like to stop off for a drink?
You mean they ate each other up?
Come here for a minute, first.
You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
What do you mean?
No, Dad.
Are you sure?
Who's Tony?
How does he tell you things?
Try to think what it was.
No.
Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up, wake up Danny, wake up.'
Is Tony one of your animals?
No.  It's the little boy that lives in my mouth.
Do I have to?
No, um let's see I guess Danny started talkin to Tony about the time we put him into nursery school.
Delbert Grady.
And, er... where are they now?
Well, he is a very willful boy.
Perhaps they need a good talking to, if you don't mind my saying so. Perhaps a bit more.
Yeah.  We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.  But how did you know that?
What'll it be, sir?
Yeah... that's all it is.
I love it.  I really do.  I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
Wendy,  let me explain something to you. Whenever you come in here and interrupt me, you're breaking my concentration.
Yes.
And you didn't see anything at all?
Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
Stay away from me!
Stay... stay away!
Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh... 
No, my son's discovered the games room.
How're you getting on?
Just like a ghost ship, huh?
Eight thirty.
Fine.
Uncle Al-
Jesus.
I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
And my dad says it's kids. But it's not rats and it's not kids. It's-
Piss on him. Piss on all the Red Sox.
A bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies?
What?
What the hell does that matter?
Well... was it a prescription?
There! You see!
It could have been anything, Marty.
What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
I saw what I saw.
The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.
What you say?
Probation?
Who?  The other woman.  Your wife.
Yes, Betty?
HE'S SO FINE.
Not in years.
Babies
Reverend Mother says you need experience, right, in life.  In order to make a responsible decision.  This is going to be very painful for me.  You know how much I love this little room. This whole convent.  Wait.
Now you.
Right.
I don't know, some people just don't like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler.
I WAS HELL-BOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING
Silence?  No talking?  All day?
My what?
Wait.  No.  You're kidding.  Lights out? At nine?  My day's just starting.
Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
Look, this isn't my kind of thing!  I wasn't cut out to make little tapestries, or knit little sweaters! I don't do that! I'm a star!
A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor?
Exactly.  People like going to theaters and casinos.  But they think church is for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack the joint.
And I am refusing.  As of tomorrow, Mary Lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir.
What?
Okay, so I just got things started.  But you could build on that.  You could keep it going.
Oh?
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
Okay -- no limo.
No nothing.
I'm gonna put you in the last place on Earth that Vince would ever look for you.
Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here but me.  We're trying to get a quick court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.
Like what?
It wasn't my fault!  They just showed up.  It's helping the convent.
Jesus, look at you   You're glowing.
I've been worried about you.
Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
But -- wait.
Who are you guys?
You know so much.  They've got Christy, and we've got to find her.  Get her 8x10, from in front of the lounge.  Fax it to every contact we got.
That's what I figured, too.
She's praying.
We can't leave it up to the Feds!
All right.  It's a beginning.  Las Vegas, Nevada.
Which convent was that, Sister?
It's no use.  She just isn't here.
And what a lovely name.  Las Vegas...
She said they were from her old convent.
But where?
We're a small convent, Bishop.  Surely there are... more appropriate shelters.
But, Bishop...
She did.  Bring her back.  Now.  For a talk.
This is not a time for frivolity, Katrina, is it?  Am I mistaken?
Then, name one person who has seen him with their own eyes.
I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
I hit him square.
The Lenape.  He comes to gawk at civilization from time to time.
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
Must we again hear these heretical rantings?
And now Jonathan Masbath.
He would not have gone into the Western Woods.  No sane man would.
Well... so much for common sense.
No, I couldn't...
Listen.
It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
What books?
I know.  Hold on.
Take the reins.
Other people?
Small talk.
If you want.  But...
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
Where?
Look closer.  Do you have anything to clean it with?
I can show exactly.
Leave me.  You are not welcome here.
No one will believe your lies, whore.
May I see my mother?
She is guilty.
Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe you did tell me that one before. I've heard that a bunch. Long time ago.
I like them french-fried potaters.
You got any money?
All right then. I'll see you bright and early. How you comin' along on that garden tiller?
Sure.
Give me the big'uns.
Karl's my name.
They was a boy. We made friends.
Don't say nothin' about that boy.
I figured that. Well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. You'll throw him out. Looks like you got a wagonful.
He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
You know what we ought to do tonight?
What do you want, hun?
It went real good.
I heard you was more than friends. I heard Dick Rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin' at it in the same room with poor, little, old Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney.
You believe in the Bible?
A good deal of it, I reckon. Can't understand all of it.
Baptized? Well, get baptized then. I don't give a shit. Call a fuckin' preacher, goddamnit! I can't baptize you.
You shut up you, fuckin' retard. Get your shit and get out of here.  That was a wake-up slap, Frank. Remember. Reality, like I said. Don't forget any bit of what I said to you and we'll be fine.
I'm closing the door now. I told you, I'll see you later.
I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
She says it's for the times when he's good to her. She's lonely since daddy died. She said sometimes she don't know why.  He threatened to kill her if she ever left him. My daddy would kill him if he was here and somebody was mean to mama. Vaughan, he's real good to mama. Vaughan that you met. But he's not able to do anything to Doyle, he's funny you know. Not funny ha, ha, funny queer. He likes to go with men instead of women. That makes him not to be able to fight too good. He sure is nice though. He's from St. Louis. People who are queer can get along better in a big town. He got transferred here to work. But mama said the real reason he left is 'cause his daddy hated him. For bein' the way he is. I wish he liked to go with women. I'd rather him be mama's boyfriend than Doyle.
It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.
That gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin' with her.
Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you.
Yes sir. You ort not know that language.
You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.
Yeah.
My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
A boy or girl?
Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.
I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if neither one of us is no count it won't make no difference.
We're liable to win if we keep this up. For somebody like you, you sure run fast.
No sir.
You have to Karl. You have to look out for me. You don't let that son of a bitch run you off.
You're just a boy. You ort not to use that sort of language.
Yes sir.
Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl got things we need to do.
I don't know. He just said he'd eat out there.
Did Vaughan go home?
Well, when you like pricing items as much as I do, I guess it's just bound to happen sooner or later.
Yeah.
You better go get 'em.
I reckon.
Karl, this is my boyfriend, Doyle. Frank, why don't you and Karl go out in the garage and fix him up a place or play a game or somethin'. Vaughan, you ready to go?
I didn't aim to.
Okay.
Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.
I like Frank. He's a good boy. Me and him's made friends.
That's okay. It's not really my business. I have wondered though. Why was it? Was it like a nervous breakdown?
I could shore use some. Thank ye.
Yeah.
What's that you say?
Naw, I ain't.
Listen, before you get very used to staying here, I think you and I need to talk about a few things. Can I take you to lunch?
I reckon not.
Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you?
I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.
This evenin' I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight.
Naw, not yet.  I want ye to give this to Mizz Wheatley. Hit ain't much, but maybe there's a little somethin' to hep out. Hits what I've earned fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot fer Bill Cox.
Why won't he talk to women?
I knew he slept in a toolshed.
Before they were married?
One of his Daddy's Bible lessons I imagine. Y'all pull up a chair. I'll go out and talk to him.
Signs?
I didn't mean that.
No wonder it's such a screwed-up place.
Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.
I'd love to.
You run out of Schimmelpennincks?
That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.
Amazing.  I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project?
You'll never get it if you don't slow down, my friend.
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
Slow down, huh?
Yeah, that's what I'd recommend. You know how it is. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, time creeps on its petty pace.
It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor.
Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea.  You know anything about Christmas stories?
Anything good?
You're looking good, Auggie.
At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people.
You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.
You don't give up, do you?
She looks just like you.
You told me you wanted to meet him. Well,here he is.
Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control.  I could run this store in my sleep.
Ten o'clock tomorrow morning. I'll be there.
This way, gentlemen. Let's retire to my office, shall we?
Jesus, man, you're one fucking mess.
I thought maybe he was pretending.
What can I do for you?
Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water?
Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected?
You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
Five bucks! You mean you're going to charge me five bucks just to look at it?
Hi there, little brother.
Say hi to Paul.
No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
No, wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life.
I owe you something.
Good. Lemonade it is.  I'm Paul.
Rashid. Rashid Cole. 
That's okay. I've already had lunch.
Except that there's no bed, is there? And no breakfast either.
Thanks, but I'll manage.
My father did. Believe it or not, that little baby is me.
Eight-thirty?
You'll find juice and eggs and milk in the refrigerator. Cereal in the cupboard. Coffee on the stove. Take whatever you want. But it's time for me to get started in here.
I don't have much time. 
And?
Why don't you go to the police?
You work too hard, you know that?
I mean earlier. We could have planned something.
Here, catch.
No wonder he was angry.
He was out five thousand bucks, he said.... He kept saying it over and over.... Five thousand bucks down the drain.... He wouldn't stop.... Five thousand bucks, five thousand bucks.... He was like out of his mind with those five thousand bucks....
Wow. They sure did a job on you.
I don't mean to pry, but I see a kid walking around with a big knapsack on his back, and I begin to wonder if all his worldly possessions aren't stowed in there. Are you in some kind of trouble or what?
You want another one of these, too?
Did he see some <u>danger</u> from defen...
Unwritten rule of the sea.  We don't bother each other, stick to ourselves. Ask anybody.
Couldn't get on the boat.  I'd just <u>shoot</u> the feller.  <u>Then</u> tie up, throw him inta th' drink.  And skip bein' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding.
Well, it does seem mighty warm in here.  Specially for Mr. Hooks.
And then, something did.  Carl Heine was found dead.  With his head crushed.
Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.
I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and I.  Are very sor...
Oh, in a heartbeat.
And the last...?
Found on Carl's boat, too.  Starboard side, second cleat from the stern. But it doesn't match Carl's lines. It matches Miyamoto's.  perfect.
And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
Objection!  Speculation.
I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
My expertise.  Is that I'm a journalist.
Actually, she said you had decided. Decided <u>not</u> not come forward.
Should have told 'everything'. Meaning, you should have told the <u>truth</u>.
Yes.
Well, anything coulda caused that.
Sure you did.  Help me with this hold cover, willya?
But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
Sure, anything's poss...
<u>Yes</u>, I'm sure.
Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
Carl said he didn't like Kabuo much anymore.
That's all he said.
Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?
Yes.  And that one, too.
Bye.
Wanna see my driver's license?
Bull fiddle.
I thought I made it clear I don't want any drinking in this outfit.
All right, girls - from the top again.
What did he say?
Where were you guys?
But suppose it doesn't?
Look at the bull fiddle - it's dressed warmer than I am.
With you.
With me?
But, Joe - three weeks in Florida!  We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
You've flipped your wig!
I'll think of something.  Don't crowd me.
Knock it off, will you?
I never did like the name Geraldine.
Now you tore the other one.
And I'm not even pretty.
Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
Me?  After Sugar?
With ME?
Oh, no!  Not tonight, Josephine!
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
What are you talking about? You can't marry Osgood.
Look, stop treating me like a child. I'm not stupid.  I know there's a problem.
I'll say there is!
Like what?
We've been discussing that.  He wants to go to the Riviera - but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.
But they're from Osgood.  He wanted me to wear them tonight.
We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
Hello, Room 414?  This is the ship-to-shore operator - I have a call for Miss Sugar Cane.
First thing we got to do is get out of these clothes.
Yeah, but they're not watching yachts. Come on - you're going to call Osgood.
There's a convention, all right.  There's also the ladies' morgue.
That's all right.  I was afraid it was Sweet Sue. You won't tell anybody, will you?
Anything wrong?
Why you poor thing - you're trembling all over.
I'm fine.
How's the bottle?
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
No fair guessing.
We'll rent some at the bathhouse. How about you, Josephine?
You're so flat-chested.  Clothes hang so much better on you than they do on me.
I met one of them.
What do you think, Josephine?  What does it say in your crystal ball?
Yes.  He wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he's going to pick me up at the pier.
Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?
Wait a minute, Joe.  Lets talk this over.  Why couldn't we do it?  Last year, when we played in that gypsy tearoom, we wore gold earrings.  And you remember when you booked us with that Hawaiian band?  Grass skirts!
Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding. You're barking up the wrong fish.
This is where I get off.
Who?
You know something, Mr. Fielding? You're dynamite!
Got it.  Supper - yacht - after the show - I'll tell her.  Your yacht?
Just the two of you?  What about the crew?
You won't breathe nothing' - not even air.
You're making it up pretty good so far.
Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
Yes, we're the new girls.
All right - lets take it from the top. And put a little heat under it, will you?
Oh.
I'm not very bright, I guess.
Then why did you take this job?
You see, I have this thing about saxophone players.
That so?
Men!
About what?
Bienstock.  He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose.  Wouldn't you know?
Would you mind terribly?
Seventy-five.  That's three-quarters of a century.  Makes a girl think.
You're not hurt, are you?
Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are.
Would you mind moving just a little? You're blocking my view.
- Inauguration balls -
You know, it's amazing we never ran into each other before.  I'm sure I would have remembered anybody as attractive as you.
You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.
I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play.
And you will come to hear us tonight?
Oh, Josephine - just imagine - me, Sugar Kowalczyk, from Sandusky, Ohio, on a millionaire's yacht.  If my mother could only see me now -
You're flattering me.
I don't want to bore you.
Tomorrow night?
Where to?  South America?  Oh. That is unexpected.
You see, we have those oil interests in Venezuela - and I just got a cable from Dad - the board of directors decided on a merger.
You're not?
I didn't do anything.  It just happened.
I told you - I'm not very bright.
I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
Coffee?
Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
Hello, copper.  What brings you down to Florida?
I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them.
I cut myself shaving.
I sleep with my spats on.
You boys know anything about any garage - or any witnesses?
I already told you.
Refresh my memory.
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
Okay, Charlie.
We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.
Just dropped in to pay my respects.
Oh, I wouldn't say that.  You were nice enough to recommend my mortuary to some of your friends...
Oh, shut up and be happy. Its always this or that. Youre never happy, you frowny-faced Grumplestilskin.
The wedding.  I am so, so bad! I dont think I should be allowed to get married.
Its not me. I swear. Its her. Shes magic.
And she wonders why I swim to the bottom of a Lemondrop every time I see her.
Whatever you do, dont mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies.  Or Edith Piaf.
Jeffrey told her last night.
Theres a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
Mom, please.
You are taking the piss?
But, somehow, it was Kats arse that was stung by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.
Is that why you brought him? Because of me.
Right. Seven.  Christ, thats a long time, isnt it?
I shagged Amy. Two years ago. Thats why I ended it. And then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And, you know, morally wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it.
Both.
I dont do naked. My sister? She does naked.
He was pretty drunk, but I think hes still crazy about you.
I dont know.
On the nose.  I tell you what, because youre so cute, Ill take care of our incidentals.
Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.
A weekend?
A wedding.
This happened to you?
I have a friend at the magazine.
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
So, whyd you say yes to me?
Desperation?
So whats with the nickname?
You pawned it.
Hi, kiddo.
Just drunk enough.
Hard.
No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost.
Here, you put your hand under the water and I'll pump for you.
Let me see it...
I try...
Because all you could think of was getting away from the guard.
You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
I been like that myself, when I thought nobody was gonna believe me...  You wanna hear another story?!
Yes, mam...
Yes, Miss Johnson...
Go on...
No buts, Rita!
You would do that, wouldn't you?
You learnin' anything at that school?
Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
They is!? It shore is good to see you, boy!
He'll show up one day.
You bet we is!
Well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us?
What's that, son?
I'm gon' miss this ol' raggedy place.
Nathan Lee Morgan...
Yes, David...
Tuck that shirt in, David Lee.
He'll be all right, Mama. I'll make him all right.
How can you do that? You don't live anywhere near that school.
It's the heat.
He can't get up, Mama!
Hi, Mrs. Boatwright...  I'm sorry 'bout the way I acted the other day, Miss Boatwright.
I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.
Maybe soon--
I need some nutmeg, flour, eggs, sugar, and...
Tired.
Mornin'...
I'll wait till after the children.
It's lunchtime, and I wanna have a talk with you, Nathan Lee. Come on, children...
There are more important matters right now...
Eric!
They're burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war.
That book wasn't Canadian!
Maybe THAT'S who your father is, Cartman!
I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME! I'M NOT LOU FERIGNO FOR PETE'S SAKE!
Cartman! What the hell are you talking about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!
Yeah, I'm having total deja vu right now. Like this has all happened before...
Kenny! I saw Kenny again!
But mom!  I'm not fucking addicted to fucking bad language!  I don't have a fucking problem!
Mkay, kids from all over the State have been brought here, because you all share the same problem. Uh, young man... Let's start with you.
Eric?
I don't know.
This is the place--
MPH RM!!!
Mrph mprhm mm rmph!
A deal? You wanna make a deal with the devil. Well sure, deals are mounds o' fun.
Uhh... I don't know.
Yeah...
How do we do that?
Isn't that in Arizona or something?
Okay...
Wake up, people!  We all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals?
Oh, uh...  I don't know if air strikes are necessary.
No, it was worse than that...
Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.
You are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school!
A letter from who, you shit sucking cock master?
YOU'D fuck your uncle!
The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate, but how can they blame US?
I mean cute dumb. Now bend over!
<b>Hey, guy, relax, put out! You gotta relax, shut your mouth- Baby I'd do anything for ya! Now don't make me smack you in the eye like last time-</b>
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for-</b>
<b>Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for</b>
We're going to die here like baby mice who have had no milk in days.  Dry up into crunchy little pinkies.
It can't be.
Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?
I'm sure I will.
Oh he did, did he?
Well, I guess she figures she's paying for it.
Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much.
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
Why, didn't they say?
Thank you.
Uh...
That's me.
Don't worry about me, I'm changing coordinates now.  I've come to far to be tripped up by some Dudley do-right... motherfuckers!
Over and out!
Fat chance of that.  Even if we had C4 and a laser torch these doors wouldn't budge.  That son of a bitch...that stupid son of a bitch.
Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
Great.
So we did.
Yeah?
I'm about to blow the wall.
We don't have time.  I'll explain later, hurry!
Marry you?
Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.
We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
How am I supposed to know?
You're Delbert Miles!  You have more clout than some whacked out pilot!  Talk to him!
Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
One moment please...  one moment please...
Lemme see your ball.
When you get a chance.
Right, eating at the core, eating it's way out. It makes me sick!
A beautiful thing. And you know why Buzz? You know what we got? Buzz raises an eyebrow as he buttons his shirt.
Theo.
They suspended me for 100 years.
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
I couldn't pay someone enough to try to kill me. Sheila comes over to take their orders.
I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles.
He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
No...
Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.  I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up.
I am underground.
We should leave this town. I can't take this anymore. I'm not gonna let him kill you in my house.
I gotta go. Love ya mom.
It feels good to let it out, doesn't it? Sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
Blueface! Blueface is my favorite.
If I find out Buzz is comin' up short on dwarf bowling, it's lights out for him and pink slips for you. Sid and Breeze look sideways at each other.
What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
A guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. You got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - PSSSHHT! -  shish kebabs.  Maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good.  I think I could help you, Theo.
Line up where you want it.
Now swing it out a little to the right...
Like this?
Who wants to know?  Zeus!
I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
I'm not here to - I can't...
Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
No. Do You?
Plan B is your dad.
Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
Really? I kinda like it.
More than you could afford.
And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.
Way too late. Buzz Fazeli is history.  Too late for what?
You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming?
I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.
I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.
Dwarf bowling's illegal.
I'm the next of kin. I should've seen him.
Open it, Captain!
I can't...
Yeah.  I heard you.
There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
Shut up, Beth.  I don't want to hear it.
Fifty yards and closing.
Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat.
Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you.
The Pentagon?  I didn't know I had friends in Washington.
Storm?  What storm?
He's here somewhere.  Find him.  The sub's on it's way.  Go!  C'mon!
Wait a second --
No.  I think we should shut down the communication lines inside the habitat.  He might be listening now.
Jerry?
Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?
I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
What's the message?
He understands me fine.
The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.
What do you make of this?
Maybe it's a message of some sort, you know?  See this red here.
I am not gonna explain in some damn report that one person died in a deepsat expedition so we could meet an alien named Jerry.
The sensors are picking up something outside.
Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.
So what?
In Edmunds' things.
You went through Edmunds' things?
It's done, alright?  It's over!  And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay?
I would.  But my suit --
I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
My air isn't... I'm coming back.
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
We must've had it delivered then.
You think?
This being after you so carefully fixed my suit.
You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
What?
"... according to calculations of some naturalists, one of these animals, only six feet long, would have tentacles 27 feet long.  That would make a formidable monster."
Manifested?
When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
I don't know.
Ephedrine hydrochloride.
Tarazine?
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
It's like a sleeping pill?
Beth --
Look, it's either him or us, Norman. Another attack, and we go down with this place.
In the sub.  Resetting the timer. Why?
You know what I mean.
Someone did.
You're lying --
You think I care?  You think I care if I die?  Would I put explosives around the habitat -- set on vibration sensors -- that can trigger automatically, if I cared about myself?  Would I? I've tried twice before, Norman, why wouldn't I try a third time?  I'm not thinking about myself -- No, Norman, I'm thinking about you.  Your safety. Protecting you from your own self.
Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
Cannibalism, to be extreme.  And now we're talking about a new life form. Their values and ethics may be incomprehensible.
Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.
What?
No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
Is it coming from our own computer?
I'm fine.
Wait a second, I --
So what?
Meaning we're never gonna get to the surface alive... to tell anyone.
Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.
It's like...
Then explain it to me.
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
I thought she was with you.
But why would she -- ?
How do we decode it?
I don't think so.
No.  I don't.  But I always said to myself, when I die, I want to die laughing.
We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.
Just one of Norman's many secrets.
You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
Please.  It must have flown here --
It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.
Salt's good for you, Ted.  Helps you from getting impotent.
See?  No code.  What'd I say?
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of the ocean no less.
Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.
He didn't say much at all.  Honey --
Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --
This isn't a game, you know.
All of them altogether. You seem to have gotten yourself into a fine mess!  What happened?
I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
Not any more!
Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.
There are two halves of the Force of Others.  One is positive and will help you if you learn how to use it.  But the others half will kill you if you aren't careful.  This negative side of the Force is called the Bogan, which is where the expression came from, and it is the part that is used by the Dark Lords to destroy their opponents.  Both halves are always present.  The Force is on your right, the Bogan is on your left.  The Kiber Crystal can amplify either one.  The Crystal Darth stole was the last one in the possession of the Jedi.  When he joined the Sith, the power of the Dark Lords was completed.
Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.
But there was a lot of firing earlier...
Yes, sir.
Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
You don't believe in the Force?
What are you saying?
Well, if it's not, we'll be facing that Death Star all by our lonesome.
I know, but the chances for survival here just aren't great enough in my book.  I've got what I came for. Now I've got to get back to my ship.
No need, everything's under control.
If you're as good a pilot as you are a swordsman... We're the ones who have been rewarded.
Are you safe?
Good.  We're right above you.  Stand by.
See Threepio!  Do you copy?
We're the old men, Ace.
Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?
No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
Hey, bugs don't take prisoners.
Is it true ?
Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical
Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.
Excuse me...!
It's all I think about anymore.
How do I know if this is love ?
What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.
Shhh...
I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
I love you.
Thank you, ma'am.
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.
Yeah ! We'll talk it out and have a good glass of wine ... and... well, we love you, son.
Looks like rain.
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
They'd rather spend our lives than risk their ships. Who's got the nuke ?
Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
Sir, yes, sir !
Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because...
Aw, don't get mushy.
Then I hope you have a crazy pilot ! Keep the line open, Dizzy !
The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
Uh, I don't know.
Kill the bitch.
The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet.
Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.
More data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage.
That is logical. You may procede.
To join, and become One with the Creator?
They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
May I ask Why?
Mister Chekov, log Mister Spock's Starfleet commission reactivated; list him as Science Officer; both effective immediately.
Twelve seconds...!
I stand corrected Mr. Decker.  Navigator, lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there...
Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.
See that it is.  Take me over, please.
Sit down, please.
Negative, Captain. I could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic. I can explain nothing more; I understand nothing more.
Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
Get someone up here to take the Navigator's station...!  Engineering... full emergency power!
Delay that order, Scotty...! Disengage all main drive systems!
I am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information.
And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.
No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
What answers?
Thank you, Scotty. Stand by.
You bringing your new friend?
Yes.
It's...
Central High, 'n' matinees, the Bijou Theatre.
No, no, I see...
Yes...
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
Yes...
Mister White is...
I...I decided to give it another chhh...
You'd know better'n me.
Well, first, you got to change the title...
Me?
Better idea...
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
Read the card.
You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?
Hi.
Going home.
I'd love to.
Gosh, you look nice.
You know what else a man can do?
...and we could get up every morning...
They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...
...you think that's right...
I'm going to tell the truth.
If I go to jail...?
That's right...
It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  I'm sorry.  It isn't <u>you</u>, j...
I'm sorry.
Well, they don't always leave with the ones they came in with.
Hope to tell you.  Didn't I pick the fragments of glass out of Bob Barrenger's actual head myself.
Courthouse back in town.
Uh -- why did we have to leave New Hampshire?
What, what, what, what do they got that can pass for the Old Mill...
They think it's your First Wife...
That Could Be.
...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
I <u>know</u> my lines...
But, that's the way of the world, huh? Everybody's gotta eat.  Way of the world.
She's a...
What I...
Alright.  Let's...  Page five, the fucking <u>horse</u> dies.  You know, <u>she</u> could be in the movie, she could, she's got a good face, she could be the Doctor's...uh, why does it have to be his, uh, <u>wife</u>...?  It could be his...
Bob, Bob, stick to the business, will you?
<u>Bobby</u>...
How could she turn on me like that?  I thought she liked me.
I just don't know what <u>order</u> they come in...
You have to what?
Well, what's the beef?
Get him on the...
But not that <u>way</u>...
Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
I...I...
I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
He treated me as if I were a child...
I'll put the, in your r...
That's cor...
Put something in his room.  What does he like?
Did she throw up?
I can't tell.
Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
Doug...
Now:  the Waterford Merchant's Association, of who I am Council...
Arrest him.
He told you that...
Eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.
What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
The writer.
We're very upset with her.  Get someone to <u>double for her</u>, her tits, the tits scene, call L.A.  I want to see some <u>pictures</u> of the women's <u>tits</u>.  Of their <u>tits</u>.
You're very sorry, you passive aggressive, son-of-a-bitch...can we replace him?
Did you, where are we going tonight...?
You what...?  Is that on the callsheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that <u>personal business</u>?  Ah, Christ. <u>Marty</u>...Are we <u>paying</u> you?
I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location.
I know the feeling.
That's a real <u>fault</u>, I...
Then, you <u>write</u> that.  And then this is <u>our</u> second chance.  That's why we're here...
You were there.  At...at 10:35...?
They're coming Fedex...
I got a company...give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.
Is that one hell of a kid?
No, just the...there's no witnesses, right...?
Here it is: Statutory r...Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah..."statutory"..."unsupported testimony by the..."  Hold on, Bobby...  You've got nothing, and you know it.  By God, you know it.  Harassment.  You need a...Even if this was true, you need a witness.  You need someone puts her in the car, and you've got nothing.  Now we all have...yes, give her that part in the film.  Yes, we'd love to have you...Now: we all have more important things to do, isn't that right...?
...not the Lazyboy...
<u>Whatever</u> you need.  The City Council, of course, has to pass on your...
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.
But, Wally, the window of the <u>firehut</u>...
I don't <u>want</u> to be Lady Godiva anymore, no matter <u>how</u> much I like chocolate.  I want to be a stud.
Mommy's marrying Rache!
Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
THEN TURN OFF THE CARTOON!
I could help with the debate.
...they all yell 'There goes the Virgin Queen' or the 'Ice Princess', or some <u>really</u> clever cut like that. Like it hurts my feelings.
Let me be the judge of that.
That's because your mother is a fine person, finer than I will ever be.  Now, just this once...
Cos she loves you.
No.
Mmmm!  Tasty.  You're a master chef Ben. Just like your dad.
No!  You're cheating -- you have to start from the beginning and you have to read the whole thing I can't sleep otherwise.
IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BIG GUY, OPEN UP.
I have lava.
No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.
If you want me to hate her I will.
Where are you, anyway?
Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.
Pray.  We never find out.
That's Rache's song!
Well, don't make him disappear before I see him.
You dying.
You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
Let's take our best shot.
Have you still never told him?
I'm here.
They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father.
Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
Easy enough.
Partly.  But partly, you're mad.
Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago?  The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting.
Just not to me.
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
Yeh, better I should forcefeed him burnt lamb and...couscous, was it she made him?  Boy, kids go wild for that.
Walk in the park.  And thanks for the 'we'.
Can I please have a cup of coffee?
We don't have any coffee.
Of all the <u>cheap</u> excuses.  To break a child's heart.
I don't recall inviting you.
Anxiety.
Wowie.  How wonderful!
Really.  By what right?  Six months of part-time screw-ups?
I don't, but...
I have given them more<u>love</u> and more <u>care</u> every fifteen <u>minutes</u> of their lives, than you could manage in the next fifty <u>years</u>!
Is that what he told you?
He looks familiar.  Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?
Right down to the ground.  Let's get to it.
Oh please.
Neutral ground.  What's up?
You're the hip and fresh.
You ride with Annabelle...
You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...
I have their past.
Uh-oh.  I mention marriage, all of a sudden...  Ve <u>haff</u> to ta...
You don't need to.  I don't expect you to handle them yourself.
Uh.  Annabelle's video report has been switched again.
We have the kids.  Next weekend.
It's no biggie.
No, she threw you out.  What a difficult woman.
No.  I'm doing it behind her back.
Maybe he's gay.
Like what?
Thanks, Scoob.
Really? Well, all right! Let's take a look at the television and see how we look.
TV talk-show host, OK. You were at sidekick eight seconds ago, then TV talk-show host. You'll be a Latin dictator in a bout a minute.
No.
I did not go to high school.
This is work.
Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.
Who is Jesus?
Jesus was not bad.
Thanks. I'll tell Mike.  Well, it's still just a beginning. I know I can...dig deeper.
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
What's an audience going to tell you?
I can read it to you.
Well, I changed the ending a little.
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
Just the same.
Maybe he's that one in a million!
Thanks.
Can I join you?
Maybe. She's OK.
...gger.
Any books you like to read for fun?
I hate reading.
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
Oh, fine. How are you?
Great!
So what's going on?
Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
That's good. So then what do you do now?
Hunh.
Huh. Kids?
How many?
Thanks.
How'd you get it?
I know.
I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just...a little nervous, I don't know why.
But what did you get on your SATs?
Yeah and we don't have much ammo either!
Rule two:  without alternative, use yourself as a shield.
Well Cooper...
Good...
I don't know.  If you gave me a reason to...
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
What do you mean?
I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified!
I know what I'm here for-you don't need to remind me.
Richter-we got a problem!
I want the girl.  I don't care about the rest--but a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. We'll make headlines all over the world...
We're almost done piping in directly to the Olympia.  Should have it all in about an hour or so.
If I don't get power up we are!
The food - you wouldn't put - anything in it, would you?
If he's not there, try...  87 - 43 - 56.
Give that back to me.
Mister President, I can't buy this malarkey; they wouldn't set the damn thing off.  Why should they?
Ah, but if we were able to untrigger it, that would be defeating its purpose.  All our enemies would have to do, would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions. We would bluff, naturally, but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it. Now we can say: There is no point trying to intimidate us, we don't control the Doomsday Machine.
Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs.
What about the President?
That's government property, Major.
What did you say, sir?
You aren't sure!
I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to take the film out.
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
Yes, sir.
Condition Red!
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
A shooting war!
Yes, sir.
You're right, sir.
No calls at all.  With or without my say-so. My voice can be imitated too, Major.
Are you trying to be insubordinate?
No, sir.  I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.
Now, as soon as you've done that, double- up on all base security teams.  Our enemies are plenty smart, and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs.
He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?
You're very naive, Major.  Don't they say they want disarmament?
I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.
Go on, Major.  You fascinate me.
But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
And you'd like to see that?
Do you think we'd cheat?
I presume the planes are armed?
How could you let this happen, General Schmuck?
Have you tried the recall again?
Well, sir, if the A/C's a really good man, I mean really sharp, why he can barrel that plane along so low - well you just have to see it some time.  A real big plane, like a Sting Ray, zig-zagging in, its jet exhaust frying chickens in the barnyard ---  Has he a chance?.....Hell, yes!  He has one hell of a chance.
Main interference linked to electronic detector.  Fight interference on readi- ness state.
Speed?
Hang on, boys.
Ready, Major.
Listen, I think I'm hit bad.
Shoot, Lothar.
Seond safety.
I bit his jugular vein.  Now will you shut up and get up here???
Listen, give me a shot quick!
What are you talking about?
Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders.  And therefore, to disregard anything that doesn't come on the CRM-114.
Look, King, maybe you've lost too much blood, or something.
Sorry, King.
It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?
I'm okay.  What's up?
Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.
Maybe the warning system's out.
But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? I mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?
Mister President, man is an amazingly adaptable creature.  After all, the conditions would be far superior to those, say, of the Nazi concentration camps, where there is ample evidence most of the wretched creatures clung desperately to life.
A special committee would have to be appointed to study and recommend the criteria to be employed, but off-hand, I should say that in addition to the factors of youth, health, sexual fertility, intelligence, and a cross-section of necessary skills, it would be absolutely vital that our top government and military men be included, to impart the required principles of leadership and tradition.
I don't anymore.
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life.
You didn't get me in trouble.
Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
No I quit.
Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it.
I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
Where are you-hoo?
No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.
Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
No, I'm not worried.
No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
Y- s-sure it did.
She's dead?
Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
Tim...
That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!
Great.
In two more years I'll have an engineering degree. We'll sell the store, we'll move away from Burnfield and the store and you standing here.
No, no, whoa!
Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now.
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
I didn't want to eat this much, man.
Come on. Inside.
Yeah, totally.  So, uh, what do they interview you about?
You rich?
You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?
You think I'm rich and you hate me.
I'd like to.
You cut off your little finger?
I know. It's okay.
Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs.
No.
What?
I hit her.
Oh, shit.
The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking.
They never hurt me? They hurt me every day with their attitude. You know, like they even have a right. Who the fuck do they think they are? Let me tell you something, I was born here. Alright? I'm an American. And I'm owed something. Look, they took it from me.
Will you just put the gun down?
Just put it down.
I don't know.
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
Okay. Nazeer, okay?
I'm trying to communicate how I feel, Jeff. You know raise consciousness. Make people think for a change.
Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
Okay. Well, you know, he's always been a nice guy and I like him.
Okay, but nothing happened. Believe me, if I thought something really bad was going to happen, I would've done something.
What feelings?
Of course.
No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?
So what do you wanna do?
New ground?
You do.
No. No, no, no.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
Why don't you just try? Please. For me. Come on.
I, yeah.
No, no, I have to talk to you.
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
We sold, uh, over ninety thousand units and uh... and Danny says that we're gonna get a gold record. Yeah.
Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.
So how's college?
Well, not exactly.
I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.
Well, what about this?
Yeah, yeah. That's the fucking problem.
What are you saying?
Oh!
Yeah?
You have to go. You always did such, uh, you know, great work. I still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall.
You do not!
Yeah.
And you know why it's so good? See, because, see, you guys are real. No, man, I mean it. You guys have a sense of humor. You live your lives, you know. It's simple, you know. The guys on the road, I mean, the band, all they talk about is scoring chicks... and Danny, all Danny talks about is money.
No, no, no, no, no. Uh, hey, man. You know I'm really sorry if I, if I said something wrong. I, I...
If...
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
That's because I am.
You do?
Yeah?
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
Whatever.
Don't do that.
... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay?
Uh, eleven twenty-five.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
No car.
This is great - GREAT!  Now we have to enter the front door!
NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!
It's off... I can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility. We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls!
No I don't... I keep asking because I feel fat.
So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.
I've got to get that.  Relax.  I'll see you tomorrow.
Y'think?
I sure do.
Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.
No.  Wait!  Did I say Promise!  Cross-my heart and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in my-eye we'll never miss a payment?!
Lucy, do you know for sure you're going to get that scholarship?
I'm sorry, Diane, but I'm not gonna watch my dreams fade away 'cause the Virgin Mary here thinks she's gonna get ideas from kiddie movies --
Right.  That'll be fifteen hundred - cash.
That's okay, Hannah.  It was silly to think we could learn to rob a bank from watching movies.  Sex - you can learn from movies.  But robberies?  There's no way.
We're dead!  They showed this prison movie to my youth group on Sunday.
Hold on...
She did, did she?  How is the old girl?
Hold up, hold up.  Any sentence that starts with "at church camp" ain't leading to the big "O."
Uh...maybe?
So could half the women in here.  And I'd rather go out with a nice can... So watcha here for?  To say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me...
I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
So you need my help?  Oh my G-d, this is like asking me for help with your homework.  Hey, Mink, c'mere!
Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.
I can tell her you're all tied up in the projection room.  I can give her the brush ...
Hi, Artie.
I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
Nothing for Ladd?
Schaefer.  Betty Schaefer.  And right now I wish I could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
Exactly what kind of material do you recommend?  James Joyce? Dostoosvsky?
Dark Windows.  How did you like it?
I had a teacher like that once.
Phillip, you're mad!
With a wildly beating heart.
I tell you this is half sold.
So long.
You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
What about all those ideas you had?
I'm all tied up.  I can't.
That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway?
I just don't.
Jealous.  Ever see so much junk? She had the ceiling brought from Portugal.  Look at this.
Nobody asked you to.
Hello, Mr. deMille.
We've missed you too, dear.
It's got a lot of good things.  Of course, it would be an expensive picture...
I don't care about the money. I just want to work again.  You don't know what it means to know that you want me.
Sure.  Wait a minute -- haven't I seen you -- ?
That's where the popcorn business comes in.  You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.
You're a writer, you said.
And you have written pictures, haven't you?
Or teach it a better tune.
And you'll play Salome?
I don't care.
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
Suppose you make up your mind. Do you want this job or don't you?
Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.
They've come for my car.
Can't you wait till I'm dummy?
Why begrudge me a little fun? I just want you to look nice, my stray little boy.

I'm in love with you.  Don't you know that? I've been in love with you all along.
Norma, I can't take it.  You've bought me enough.
Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.
He'a a shrewd old fox.  He can smell box office.  Only I'm going to outfox him a litt1e.  This isn't going to be C. B. deMille's Salome. It's going to be Norma Desmond's Salome, a Norma Desmond Production, starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max.
No you didn't.  You took the car.
And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.
These are nothing.  You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  What is it you want -- money?
You don't care.  do you?  But hundreds of thousands of people will carel
For me?  Okay.
Thanks.  How did you know I was going to stay, this afternoon?
Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
She was the greatest.  You wouldn't know.  You are too young.  In one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters.  Men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails.  There was a Maharajah who came all the way from Hyderabad to get one of her stockings.  Later, he strangled himself with it.
Naturally.  I brought them myself.
I'd better press your evening clothes, sir.  You have not for- gotten Madame's New Year's party.
I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night...
That's right.
Is that So?
Had to get away for his health, I suppose.
Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.
There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
Forget Romanoff's.  It's the car I'm talking about.  If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.
But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
Softball.
Sorry, mistress.
Have fun.
No, a super girl.
I've been saving it. For the right moment.
There's no need. I learned the Craft from my 						grandmother.
And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
Western Europe.
It's for your own protection.
I'm taking you to the hospital.
Later.
They don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre.
Terrific.
You can't just abandon me.  Alone.
Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
Like turning off a light.
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
Well thanks a pile, fella.
And you think you're in love.
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
I don't want your help.
Come back to my house. My car's outside.
Go on,  talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten.
I've got things to do.
Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.
Theories?
Can I quote you?
I knew it ! He's working on a  hot scoop !
The scoop of the year!
Oh, sure.
You're supposed to guess.
Thank you. You're very kind.
You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.
You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over.
You Scorpios can never take a joke.
I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.
Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused.  You could come too. It might be safer for you.
I know.
Just feels, a little, like a tiny bit of Argo City...
Help me to get back to Earth. Where my friends are. They need me.
But it's impossible.
No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too--- if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity--- no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it.
No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a sip of this? It's delicious, I think.
Mr. Roebush?
Roebush! That's  the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before...  Omigod!! What's tomorrow?
Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong?
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
Hiya, Kent, long time no see. Not that you ever could.  "See" I mean,  Hahaha!
Too much mayonnaise?
No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
Pate? What pate?  I didn't make any --  Oh, no, Clark. That's Buster's dog food.
Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.
What!
Could you get me Superman's autograph?
What are you doing?
Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
They're just . . . floating around out there. The computer knows where.
Yeah. A raise . .
Which country?
What are you talking about, fella?
Thanks, kiddo. now, listen, this part's important. I want you to program one special command into all these systems. Tell them these orders are irreversible, so it'll be impossible for anybody to switch them back. Can you do that, pal?
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
Everything.
Stone mutha.
Exactly. Stoned mother.
Suit yourself, Gus.  Say, does your boss use a computer in this operation?
Sister! I'm his sister!
A photographer eats with his camera, A Photographer sleeps with his camera --
Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
Where's the light switch?
Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---
Why do I have to do this?
Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.
The planet Superman came from. Krypton.
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
Don't bet on it!
Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.
I do?
Mr. Smith -  -- the "complimentary couch."
No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?
And you weren't. As usual. What do you say to that?
Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
I was right. you are Superman.
Let's go to my place.
Never closed my eyes.
Uh...home...
Dickens! The whole world's about to blow up and you're reading Dickens?!
What else is ballast for?
How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it.
I wouldn't know. I've never had one.
How the hell would I know? I was in high school back in those days.
He knows where the Eiffel Tower is, Olsen.  You do, don't you, Kent?
Selfish! But they get a chance at happiness. Can't I have that chance?
But you had more than that, and I know it. You and my father --  you had each other.  Can I never have what you had?
For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on Earth are classified as "criminals."
I didn't ask her anything . . .
Revenge! We will kill the son of our jailer!
What do you want?
Australia.
Me? I'm loaded with good! I mean I've never even used it.
Don't worry. I won't make you do it alone. I know all the right places. I'm a member at all the right clubs . . . We'll start tonight at the grand opening of the Metro Club! It's a date!
I'm sorry to see you go.
Like me?
Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.
Well, I'm feeling a lot better . . . almost chipper . . .  . . . and all because I had a visit from a very good nurse.
I'm going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of the world. I promise you. For it is they , and not I, that represent the people of Earth.
Superman gets mail here?
Who?
Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
I must have miscalculated. How. . .
Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
Wait! Not yet! Back!
Bunkers!
Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.
Thank you.
Otherwise, you're a Mongoloid idiot.  It's reasonable to assume that fragments of the planet were shot out into space by the force of the explosion, and  --
Actually, she's silver-haired.
Big night coming up?
Don't you ever give up?
It wasn't a trick!
He grabbed me! He held me! He set me down gently! How could that be done with mirrors?
You're just jealous.
Jealous? Of what?
Is that what they're calling him?
It isn't that I still don't like you, Clark. It's just that...well, once you've had something like that happen to you, it kind of changes a girl.  I'm going to make some coffee. You want some?
He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
Okay.  Take me to your leader.
Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
When it gets to seventy-five below, stabilize it.
Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
I'm going to bed.
Deductive reasoning, my friends! That's the name of the game. What does it say here?
Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
Tea?
What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
But so is Vond-El
It's because I'm an intrepid girl reporter, Jimmy.  Besides, the chief of detectives has the hots for me.
Don't just stand there gapin' Jonathan. Can't you see he's cold?
All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
My son, I foresaw this. I knew -
Twenty-four.
Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize, I know.
I was going to say that there's only one 'p' in subpoena. What the hell did you major in at Radcliffe? Middle English?  Nice job on the teamster's update, Kent.
How much do you weigh?
195 pounds.
No, Superman, of course not. You do get around, don't you.
Of time, Luthor.
It wouldn't hurt. You can't go on living in fantasies. Did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb? And drop it?  Why, our Strategic Defense boys would have  --
We'll see how fast I can fly.
I'm just fine, Ally.  What about you?
I'm fine.  Still working with my father.
I didn't know.  I was in a panic.  I guessed she'd been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor. The nearest hospital was forty miles away, and Zoe was continuing to swell.  Klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her, while I dialed the hospital.  I finally got a doctor on the line.  He sounded young, but cool.  He was confident, but there was a nervousness.  He have been an intern.  This was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this.  He wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing, but he was just as scared as I was.
Say hi to Zoe.
I'm telling you this because... we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel.
I don't know.
Because I was driving behind the bus, Mary.  Because I saw it.  I saw it happen...
Billy, please.  The children.
The children.
Billy, that's too early.
That's because he misses you.
Sure.
Yes.
About the Ottos?
From what?
No.  I saw it on his face.
With our hands.
That's right.
And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...
Who's been talking to you about what I'm feeling?  Who should care about what I'm feeling?
I don't know.  But it was weird in terms of what happened next.  Sean was still watching his mother.
Hi, Dolores.
I'll just strap it on the roof.
Oh, it's bizarre alright.  C'mon Bear.  Let's get you out of here.
The Ottos always waited for the bus with Bear.  They were the only parents who did that, together like that.  I guess they're what you might call hippies.
And winter?
No.  From Mr. Stephens.  That was him on the phone just now.  He was calling to see how you were.
It's like a song.
Don't you usually like to sit at the back?  To wave at your Dad?
Hard to say.  I might have...some business here.
When?
Crafts.
No.
Why are you calling me, Zoe?
'Cause you think I'm stoned, Daddy? 'Cause you think I've got a needle stuck in my arm?  Is that what you're thinking, Daddy?
I'm calling because I've got some news for you, Daddy.  Some big news.
You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
Yes.
Yes.
If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount.  If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing.  It's a standard agreement.
Don't know.  Food banks, welfare, church charity.  They scrape by.
And where did you sit that morning?
No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.
Does it fit?
Oh.  I better get some spackle.
Well, Mr. Stephens is representing several families.  The Ottos, the Walkers, us, and I think a couple more.  Mr. Stephens is suing the town for negligence.  He's sure that the accident could have been avoided if they had done their jobs right. He's a very smart man.
Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?
How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.
Will the police do anything to her?
It's compensation, Leo, for the marginal life we lead.  Sidney, did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?
Don't apologize for me, Frank!
We're on our way there now...
I guess you're right, but -
Coupla weeks.  For eight weeks.
That's a nice tour.  All booked?  When was Susie around here last?
I'm late for a date with a dame.
I'll by that, son.  Now, you owe ME a favor.  Be good to my kid sister...
Susie, I want to help you--, there's nothing I won't do for you. You're all I've got in the whole, wide world.
Now don't kid a kidder.
Bonna sera, commendatore.  Come sta?
Can I come in for a minute?
I like Harry, but I can't deny he sweats a little.
I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.
Then maybe you can tell me if he's as solid as you say, why does he rap me every chance he gets?
Integrity - acute, like indigestion.
Calculated risk.  Only we happen to know, J.J., that you like me.  I'm your star pupil -- I reflect back to you your own talent.
Don't go wild, Sidney.
But not for anything I did today...
Sidney, I know human nature.  Susie lied to me - she'll see that boy again.
Talk to her yourself...
Susie, there's nothing wrong with Dallas!  Your brother and I arranged it all. And if the Leslie boy is still a squooshy item in your life, forget it! - your brother arranged that one, too!  I don't usually give away presents; but this is my gift to you: Get out of here!  Leave this man!
Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
Go out with DIFFERENT girls!
And where was his wife?
Yeah!
And he's a perfect stranger to me.
So take five minutes!  Get acquainted!  He's an important man - he's lonely - don't be dumb!
- that's what I mean!
Pay the rent.  Let the tailor wait.
Sidney, please, dear, if you feel nervous...
Stay down town tonight.  Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
Why not you?
Why should he put on an act?  Your brother has told PRESIDENTS where to go and what to do!
Like you?
Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker.  I can promise you -
But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?
And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?
I'm sorry, baby.  This thing is just kicking my ass.  I thought we had it with this one...
I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net processor.  It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison.  But why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm going crazy here, sometimes.
What chip?
Max.
It can't form complex machines.  Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  It doesn't work that way.  But it can form solid metal shapes.
Prove it... stand on one foot.
Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.
She intends to change the future somehow.
Dyson.
Yeah, gotta be!  Miles Dyson!  She's gonna blow him away!
Drive faster.
I don't care!! There's gotta be another way. Haven't you learned anything?!  Haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?
Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
I see.  So you don't believe anymore that the company covered it up?
Why him?
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
You think you're alive and safe, but you're already dead.  Everybody, you, him...  everybody... you're all fucking dead!
On all what?
That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to!
Respect your elders and your betters!
And no elbows on the table!
And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them.
Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
'Dim-shits'?
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
That's big of him.
What is it with you, David? Where are your feelings? Where's your hatred, your disgust? Where's your fucking outrage, David?
So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwngler?
This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.
Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.
Shut the door, Emmi. Sit down, Emmi. We're going to keep him waiting, too.
Do you know where the Adagio begins?
Put it on ready to play, and I'll tell you when to play it.
What is this, Emmi?
What's not right?
If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?
I would like to go now, please.
What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwngler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally.
I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwngler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
See, David? He can't answer the question. I'll ask it again, Wilhelm, and don't give me any more airy-fairy, intellectual bullshit!
Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?
And what was that?
I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost.
'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I don't have to think carefully. This is utterly ridiculous.
Tell me about von der Null.
And what did he say?
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
You like the women, don't you, Wilhelm?
Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
Who's conducting?
One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one'?
I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That's what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That's how he made me co-operate.
Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
Politics and art must be kept separate. I'll remember that. But let me see if you can help me with something I just don't understand. I'd really like to know why all you guys are so crazy about him. What's his secret?
Do you really think it was brave? Didn't he bow to him and shake his hand?
The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
Just what you see, pal.
Great.
I'm here to help you.  Reese, Sergeant/Tech-Com, DN38416...
Tell me.  Just start at the beginning.
Come on, me? The mother of the future?  Am I tough? Organized?  I can't even balance my checkbook.  I cry when I see a cat that's been run over... and I don't even like cats.
About what?
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
That's the way it was told to me.
Later.  I'm going out for materiel.  Keep this.
No.  I'm not.
And so you feel nothing.
You'll beg for mercy in a second.
I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?
Surrounded by living tissue.
Alright, Ms. Connor.  Listen carefully.  You're in a public place, you'll be safe 'til we get there.  Stay visible. Don't go outside or in the restroom.  I'll be there in a few minutes.
Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're thirty cops in this building.
Six shots at less than ten feet.  Weapon was a large caliber--
You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer.
Projections were far too optimistic.
Will you really hold me to it over <u>pennies</u>?
What?
Please, don't do that...
A bad month.  You did the exact same thing to me last week.
Hold on...  They want your driver's license number.
Home.
It was a gift... from my brother.
If there was one.
"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
No.
Consumer Recreation Services.  It's their building.  They...
... two hundred dollars a toe.
Nicholas Van Orton?  What are you, a czar?
Can we talk?
They don't care about you anymore. Alive or dead is the same, as long as they bury you deep enough.
How many times have you done this? I'm interested.
No, now wait... think about it.  What did you see... ?
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Originally, Connecticut.
Studied acting, I assume?
Yes.
Always.
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
That's why it's a classic.  Come on, man... how 'bout a hug... ?
They'll be wanting it back.
It's a profound life experience.
Slow down, take a breath...
We're going to figure this out.  Get a grip on yourself.
What?  Connie...
Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...
Robbed?
It's different every time.
Hey, everyone -- snack time!  Here... here you go...
Shut up.  Cuff him to the rail.
Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
You're not like him at all.  I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.
The Fitzwilliam Botanical Garden Annual Fundraiser.
The Hinchberger wedding.
I'll send your regrets.  Honestly, why must I even bother?
You know you can.
Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know?
<u>Every</u> year is a good year.
Come on.  These are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist.
Go ahead.
Just stay there, Nell!
And why didn't Marrow tell <u>us</u>? Doesn't he trust women?  That fuck.
All night?
You want company?
-- how much is this car worth?
No, Malcolm!  Individual performance is only part of it.  I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
It was a stupid thing to do.
It was.
I don't know.
Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
Nell, what do we do?
But the experiment was a failure.
Why would we --
-- no one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.  No one will come any nearer than that.  In the night.  In the dark.
You're okay.
Why?
I have a loft.
Just had to be sure.
Not for you, clearly.
It's not a compliment.
Like you.
I'm a gracious host.
Okay.
Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
I don't know everyone here.  He was so traumatized he split.  Maybe he was Gordon's <u>pusher</u>.
Let him break - he likes to break.
I wouldn't talk.
Been to the Boat Show.
It was better than a telegram.
Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?
I'm just sayin' -- it was a steep hillside.  There was no moon that night ...
Valentine wasn't even there.  If he was into something, if she was involved -- who can say.  But I'll tell you something.  She stood in front of these dudes, man.  Eyeballing <u>them</u>.  Checking <u>them</u> out.  I felt like she was covering <u>my</u> ass that day.
She didn't write to me, did she.
Thought perhaps there'd be dispensing machines, you know.  Bung in your coins, come out with a .44 Magnum, fully-loaded.
Fucking out of order, that.  Shouldn't be allowed.
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
Those aren't guards.  They're valets.
One thing I need.
You steady on, man.  What the fuck else did you do back there.
It's been a while.
That's not what I heard.
Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.
Weren't you on a television series?
Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
Oh, it just ended, then.
Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
Modelling.
In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
Yesterday.  Afternoon.
No, I had -- some other matters to attend to, you know.  Getting a car sorted ...
Eight hours difference between here and London.  Would've been, what, ten in the morning, my time.  I was just coming out on the yard.  Now, I was in the habit of saving my newspaper till then.  Bit of fresh air, stretch me legs -- well, stretch the day out, really, that's what you wanna do.  And I'll tell ya:  I couldn't open the paper.  Could not pry the pages apart -- it was like they was glued together.  That's how weak my hands went.  Thought I was having heart attack, only I knew I wasn't.  Bloke come up to me, he says, Dave, he says, you've gone all white.  I said, fuck me, I've been in prison half my life, what d'ya expect. But he was dead on, 'cause I could feel the blood drain right out of me head. And I knew ...  Something had happened to Jen.
Various enterprises, style of thing.
Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
Terry's never going to give you satisfaction.  Not the type.
Depends, don' it.
She'd never called me like that before. She sounded more ... pissed off -- angry -- than upset or afraid.  But she never turned up.  I called the house but only got the answer machine.  When they found her ... she'd been going the wrong way. Not the direction she'd have gone if she'd been coming to see me.  Or coming <u>straight</u> to see me.  Who knows.  Maybe she just wanted to drive.
Early 70's.  I was away.  Maidstone.  Possibly Brixton.
These more highlights from the Zagat prison guide?
A jeweller's up the West End.  We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- <u>after</u> we'd made the grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.
I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.
I was inside once.  I punched a cop at a demo.
She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
Yeah, I guess you are.
That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
No kidding.
What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?
Nine years?  Is that legal?
Makin' trouble for someone?
The L.A.P.D.
How we gonna get that lucky?
Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?
Who's looking for you?
Go now.
I don't.
About Jenny.  Tell me about Jenny.  About the <u>deal</u>.  Whatever fucking deal you had to kill my daughter for when she found out about it, you bastard.
Ann--
I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
Just see him, as a favor to me.
It's OK...
Ah, but that is just what I cannot teach. I cannot teach her to have a soul. Look, monsieur, play the piano, is not about the fingers. *Done* with the fingers, yes. But the music, she is inside. Inside, monsieur...
Maybe.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop?
All right, I guess.
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
...Huh?
What kind of man *are* you?
Told what?
My wife and I had not... performed the sex act in many years.
Mm.
--don't interrupt me--that's Means. They got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got *you*, a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone.
I don't know. I don't think so.
I took Doris's keys.
Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh...
Uh-huh. He's the, uh...
Yeah, the best.
Sure, Walter. Thanks.
Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
Huh?
...You ever wonder about it?
I don't know... How it keeps on coming. It just keeps growing.
Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider--
Just people. They gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. This is why the big lobby, Ed. But they put their pants on one leg at a time. Just like you and me.
They too use the toilet, Ed. In spite of appearances. And their money will be secured by the barbershop. A rock. A *rock*, the barbershop. I mean, how long has *this* place been here?
My *wife*?
Could you come with me please?
Ah.
Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
Uh... you're under arrest.
Someone broke into this room.
My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!
I understand.  But Mr. Cuthbert, we've got bigger problems.  Depending on what we find today, we may have to shut you down.
To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while...
It's fool proof, basically.  I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip.  If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft.
I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --
Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out?
Where's the head?
Night watchman who found the body. Sweet old man.  Been tossing his cookies for over an hour.  Not a likely suspect.
Who didn't?  Big news.  Out of Brazil, wasn't it?
No.  There's more.  There were crates from this museum in the hold of the boat.
How do you explain the part about Beauregard?
What's that doing here?
Let me help.  I can take care of everything.
They're eggs.
With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.
We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
I wouldn't be so sure.
Chicken.  This is a great short cut.
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
It's alright.  I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone.  What is this place?
Margo, you haven't heard?
Eats them?
Maybe not.
How did you know that?
Something came up in autopsy tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.
They're all heavily armed.
No.  A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball.  I think it was bothered by my light.
The planetarium!
Then it won't go after the others?
It's coming.  Run.
Where exactly?
<i>Fiji.</i>
You are a travel agent, aren't you?  "Doris"?  Your job is to help people travel.
I thought you were in a hurry.
It doesn't matter.  I'll make other arrangements.
He gave it back to his father.
--a dead one at that.
Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, I came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it.
Amnesia.
Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.
That's correct.
We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.  As the show expanded, naturally we were forced to manufacture ways to keep Truman in Seahaven - demonstrating that every venture is accompanied by a risk.
<i>A show.</i>  Then who am I?
Because his mother got sick - very sick.  He couldn't leave her.  He's a kind boy, maybe too kind.
I think I've studied enough.
So when are you leaving?
It's not that simple.  Takes money, planning.  You can't just up and go.  Oh, I'm going to do it, don't worry about that.  I've just got to move slow.  Pick my moment.  Bonus time's just around the corner.  Soon as I finish the...
What exactly?
When you were hauling chickens for Kaiser Poultry, what was the furthest you ever went off the island?
I went all over but I never found a place like this.  Look at that sunset, Truman.  It's perfect.
So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head--?
Gee, that's great.
Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.
I know.
How do you know?
What's the hurry?
What?!
They never found Dad's body--maybe somehow--
When you get to Fiji?
You're welcome, Truman.
They're going to stop me talking to you.
--It doesn't matter.  Everybody knows about it.  They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared.
I don't understand.
You're not FBI agents.
Me?
Evidence of what?
Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
We have a situation. The members are assembling.
What's that?
Selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer.
Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.?
Show you right on a map.
I know the name. Why?
Old friend of your father's.
I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.
Well, if you've got something to tell me, you've got as long as it takes me to hail a cab...
Not according to the men in blue.
What killed those men?
What?
I'm not sure. A virus --
You're looking for a bomb.
You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.
Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of there.
Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
And you're looking for?
You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
I'd been told as much.
I can't really talk right now.
I've got a hearing tomorrow --
And where are they going with it?
Mulder --
I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this.  Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder.
Where are we?
Thank you.
-- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.
-- if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. Agent Scully doesn't deserve this.
I'm not taking any chances.
No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.
The only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids. Your father arranged for your sister's abduction. He allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so that she would survive. As a clone.  He had different hopes for you. That you would uncover the truth about the Project. That you would stop it. That you would fight the future.
We've been forced to reassess our role in Colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves.
Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?
And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
What's wrong?
I know.
This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore.  Not to him.  He never finished her.  The others...he was able to make them his.
You think you can do this, don't you?
He might tell me about Julia.  The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse.  Who wants to be redeemed.
Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.
Tell me.
Yes.  I am.
No problem.
I need you to find something in the basement...
I never kid.  My wife hates it.  Says I'm too serious.
Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy.  When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as "receivers."  All they did was observe and report.  Nothing more.  But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening.  She understood. And the patient responded.  Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things.  He knew she cared.
Initiating connection.
I'll get her...
Absolutely.
Prevacid.  For my stomach.
Any psychiatric medication?
Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl Stargher.  That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes careers.  But if we push our luck.  If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
I know. I wondered about it a hundred times, if it really was an accident.
Tell you what?
Oh, we didn't make much sense. Drank too much. Once he tried...
Let's not get into any more trouble.
Me.
Have you seen Calloway?
He told you, didn't he?
His.
Oh, well.
We loved each other, do you mean that?
I have never seen him.
He works in a military hospital.
No.
I don't want it.
No.
Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
When did you see him last?
What?
Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.
Calloway, you haven't shown me one shred of evidence.
I would like a word with this orderly Harbin.
Bring him in.
Is that what you say to people after death? "Goodness that's awkward..."
On the modern novel - you remember what we arranged and we want you to talk on the Crisis of Faith.
Who?
Listen...
It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
Sure...
Zwei zwartze.
But he said he died instantaneously.
Vinkel.
Not necessarily.
Not when I get interested.
I'm sorry, I don't think so.
Traveler.
Good morning.
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
Of course, but look; all these people. If that place existed, they'd all be there.
We're going to swim "one or two kilometers" across open sea, from one uninhabited island to another. Something goes wrong. What then?
So?
Richard?
Not too bad.
Exactly.
Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.
If it's too far, then we'll drown. But if we dont try then we'll never know.
They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....
They had Sabra and Shattila.
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
I don't, but...
Fire...
The mystics tried to read the white spaces around the letters. They thought there was a whole alternative language hidden there, with secret, alternative meanings.
No, you don't.... If you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. You know what tefillin is? Tsitsis? Shotness? You know the kaddish from the kiddush?  Eichmann? He went to Israel. He studied the Torah, the Talmud, the Mishnah, the whole bit. He hated Jews.
Actually, I think this moment has possibilities that --
You want it to be an event.
How come so many of the books are in Spanish?
That was a later invention, it's not in the scrolls.... Anyway, the Jews know where the sentences end. They know the whole thing by heart. Every word. Every letter.
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....
V'asitem...
Plus you have nothing else to do all day.
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
And be crushed.
Yeah, okay. But what if...what if... submitting...being crushed, being nothing, not mattering, what if that's the best feeling we can have?
It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.
Lina, the Thousand-Year Reich barely lasted a decade.... Do you really want to go down that road again? In America of all places, where obedience and discipline are not exactly the national virtues...
I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.
The other night you said the modern world is a Jewish disease. Could you elaborate on that?
What??!?
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
The Jews clearly control the media and the banks. Investment banks, not the commercial ones. But the point is they carry out in those realms the same principles they display in sexuality. They undermine traditional life; they deracinate society.
Differences exist, of course, but they're irrelevant. For the Jew, his Jewishness dominates everything. Even the ones who renounce it, who hate it, who want to cut it out of their hearts a knife...can't escape. They're still just Jews.
That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?
It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
Does that mean you deny what he says is true? Yes or no.
Yes. Infinitely more. They would become as God.
Explain it so I can.
Get the fuck away from me.
That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
From the Rhineland originally.
I was going to ask you the same thing.
Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
No, I don't admit it's stupid.
They're not my people....
Do you know them?  I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and --
I've got to get back to the --
Number ten.
What...?
It'll be enough if we use it right.  Okay, the service'll go about another hour. Say an hour for the janitors, then one more just to be safe... We'll go in at midnight.
Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.
Wow, that's uh...great...
Get out of my way.
I was a Jew in a previous life.
Exactly.
He was funny.
And that's when the Mets started to stink.
As you know, Cindy, thirteen is a mystical number in the Jewish faith. We believe that God has thirteen attributes...
I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree?
... I'm pregnant, Bonita!
Yes.
Does he know?
What d'you mean?
The documents are forged.
I tried him, he can't go.  His son is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow... I'll go, boss.
The Italian, I presume?
No.  He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
You know each other?
Congratulations.
Congratulations, Enzo.
Enzo, stop bitching, will you?
You know what I'm talking about.
Have the car painted.
For others, yes... For you, who knows?
Enzo...
What room have you got?
... You married?
Damn right!  That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
People say that?
I'm a little tired, I don't know if...
Why?  Are they what's most important?
Everything about what?
Well... about everything.
No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
I'm being a pain in the ass.  It's beautiful here.
It's too loud for me.
Thank you...
Give it to me.
I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.
How do you know that?
Uh... Yes, of course!
I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
I got fired.
You go down to the bottom of the sea, where the water isn't even blue anymore, where the sky is only a memory... and you float there, quietly, quietly and stay there...  and you decide that you will die for them... Only then do they start coming out.  They come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them... If it's sincere.  If it's pure... They will be with you and take you away forever.
I don't know... it didn't feel right.  I'm going to bed.  I'm tired.
... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
I saw how it has to be.
You are the father.
Anything.
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
Where I saw the mermaids?!  Why don't you ever ask any question? I'm always the one asking the question!  We're sitting here like two stones and I'm taking to myself. Ask me something, Goddamnit!
Are you crazy?  I have no use for a woman!  Since my accident.
It's my apartment.
That's different!  What's the matter with you?
No.  I'm just depressed.
You look it too.  You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins!  You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...
Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed?  I've been a jerk, right?  I should have stayed!  I was supposed to be in love... I was in love!  I am in love, why did I act like a bitch?  He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy.  It was too good to be true.
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
Then, goodbye.
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
Well, I couldn't be happier for the both of you.
I want you to talk dirty to me.
I forgive you.
So don't show a picture.
What a good poop you made in your diaper Mazel Tov! That's right! Mommy loves you! Such a good boy you are!
I understand that. I just thought that you might want to know.
Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.
I wanted to ask you, how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of Santa's workshop? We've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years.
In fact, he's just informed me that he personally plans on cancelling Christmas this year.
Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples.
That's some cold shit.
It was good. Very chilling, but you still got all the points across that we talked about.
Why not -- if you like it - if that's what you really want.
That's just it, Charlie. That's what I'm driving at. You could do anything in that time.
Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
Where? Where did you find it?
What, senorita?
She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths  that's what this procession is supposed to be.
I want to ask you something.
You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?
Yes?
Why?
More or less.
But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
That was a calamity!
I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
Nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time.
Offend a reputable citizen and involve the department in a slander suit? No. I'm in office to protect the taxpayers money  not throw it way. Come on, Charlie.
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
On his back, I suppose.
Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
I don't know  a witness. He seemed to know something about animals -- you know -- expert testimony.
I know. Funerals.
Yes. Do you mind?
I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.
Must it?
Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...
Disney! How inter...
Its a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. Im told it retails at around 4,000.  I see you dont require a definition.
Oh no. Youll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
No. Youre fired! Get out of my house. And take your sick tape with you...
Paul Lamont...?
When did you get back?
Youre repeating yourself, Mrs De Moraes.
I... Well, were burying Leon tomorrow and... Look, I wish I had more time, but its late and with the funeral...
When did you learn about his taste for kids, huh? On your honeymoon? Or was it later, when bitterness set in and you turned against your beloved but weak little brother? How did you find out? Did he confess? Try to convert you perhaps? Or was it womans intuition? Or just the way he fucked you?
Leon hung himself.
If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why dont you accuse me of killing my brother?
I dont.
...Were turning in circles.
Where is that?
Lombard...  It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile Id sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...
I wouldnt mind. Thank you.
Im sure Ill find a way.
Did you call me up here to enjoy yourself, Emily, or to let me use your phone? Because we seem to have a slight problem...
Have you found your man? Is that where he is?
Whos the guy? Whos the guy! Nom de Dieu!  Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate Id have had to kill him.
So who... Whos the man? Where is he?
If you have hard evidence about a child trafficker, we want it, Mr Lombard. And we want it before you get yourself killed...
Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months.  Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?
... Fine. Ill go for the safe place.
You... Fuck you!
...On holiday?
Yeah... This morning. He left this fucking bloody morning... Jesus, man, my knees...
Where?
Where are the kids?
I dont know...  This is just a delivery place, man! I swear I dont know where the kids are... I work for Martin, thats all. Martin knows. He works for Friedman. He knows...
Can I have the reception desk, please.
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many. 
Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, trs bien, merci. Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandmes services quelquun rcemment... Vous tes certain... Non, non...  Je vous remercie... 
Your secretary, huh!
Look Mrs Spitz... I dont know to whom Im indebted for the recommendation but... Im not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.
What I can appreciate is insolence, Mr Lombard!
How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
We conclude our transaction.
Is my money in there?
This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him.
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who cant do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
Im overcome by your public-spiritedness.
Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. Youve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name hes using?
This is the hotel supervisor, Mr Lamont. Im terribly sorry to disturb you but theres been a mix-up with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve.
We need a double-room and as I understand youre here alone wed be much obliged if youd agree to move to a single room...
I dont recollect mentioning a friend.
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
No. I meant he left as in no longer works here.
How are you, Rhian?
In my jacket. Left inside pocket.
He just said he had good reasons.
Good reasons?
Albert... Albert and Ethel. Why?
My sister... She lives in the next valley.
Is she on the phone?
Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
Id appreciate it if I could use your phone.
Excuse me?
Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
Could that be Camden Market?
But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known, reachable.
Five seconds. Then you die.
Sure. But speak English, will ya, ha ha...
Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
Why, are you not ready to die for your king?
Yes, I am.  I'm an archer who can read and write.  Who do you want to write to?
Jeanne, no...
It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!
Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop?
To be killed in battle?
But... why... what's the point?
I -- I don't understand...
One day you will.
You don't know what you're saying. You're going to leave this place, Jeanne -- you're going home -- or whatever you want -- you're going to be happy, and have children, and...
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
Are you saying that if you had not been carrying your banner you'd have killed more people?
Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
Thirty years ago?  I'm not surprised it's gone...
So long as this bitch remains alive, our armies refuse to fight!  Don't you understand?  They want proof that God is on their side... and the only way they're going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch!
... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
I will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things, but as for my revelations, I've never told anyone except my king... Charles the Seventh... the one and only king of France.
Not long ago...
The voice was in your cell?
Silence her!  Take her away...!
And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...
Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
You really think she's been sent... by God?
I know you're not yet -- but you will be, soon.
Orleans has held out for six months. I don't suppose a few days will make much difference.  Take some rest.
... and my crown doesn't fit and...  Really??
What difference does it make where she comes from?
His face.
Does he have hair?
Go on to the next question.
I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
Knowing what I know?  Enormous gratitude.
Sooner is better than later!
Yes, it's a miracle.
Me too...
Jeanne, look behind you.
Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers.
No...
Sorry Jeanne...  Did you both meet already?
What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!
If you kill him, you kill me!
My king.
What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
I -- I -- I...
I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace?  You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
I told you already... I'm here to set you free...
What do you mean, they won't come?
Yes... lots of things!
I agree...
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
Let's see.
Jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church.
And your mother -- everything's fine with her?
Oh yes, she's... wonderful.
Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
Oh yes, I play with them... lots...
Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.
Why did she have to die?
Then what will?  And what will bring her back?  And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me?  Why didn't he take my life instead of hers?  It was my fault -- I was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!!
Soon you'll be able to take the Holy Mass, and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood, you will be at one with him.
Who are you?
Wladek, please.
I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.
I'll see you...soon.
He'll be here soon.
Dead.
You'll have to stay here until tomorrow afternoon.
The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej. They're bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once.
Where do you want me to go?  Look at me. No, no, I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here?
Tough luck.
Yes, please.
Warsaw's not the only radio station.
That makes a change.
That's better than yesterday.
Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.
What are you talking about, my tie? What's my tie got to do with anything? I need the tie for my work.
You're out, aren't you?
You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?'
You're too well known, Wladek. And you know what? You musicians don't make good conspirators. You're too...too musical.
Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.
Wladek! How are you?
Fine, we're fine in the circumstances. But I can guess what you've called about. There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station--
Be ready to leave in two days' time. Same place as last night.
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
No, I don't think so?
I was... I was trying to open this tin.
Where do you live?
Not yet.
Don't thank me. Thank God. It's His will that we should survive. Well. That's what we have to believe.
To be deaf?
You don't want to learn.
What are they?
What happened?
Hello.
Do I know any gigs?
That's right.
Billie.  You ready?
At the finish, it's Single Action by two, Fasanella second, Visitation third.  Line on Single Action... 3 to 2. Hell with it, that's no good.
No, no cops!
I got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me.
He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.
You got a bag or somethin?
He had his chance and all he did was shoot up a rooming house.  Made a lotte noise and woke up a few cops, but didn't hit nothin'.
We had a few problems with the Law this morning.  The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good.  Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.
You the Duff that didn't come up with his end when Little Jeff was sent up?
Wasn't no problem a mine.
You could buy yourself some things. Clothes, or a nice car...
They workin' for anybody?
Got to.  Gondorff's ridin' the mark in from New York on the Century.
Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric.  Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.
He didn't tell me you was a fuck- up, either.  You played the Big Con since then.
I picked something up on the way.
You know anything about him?
Why?
Just a little nervous, that's all.
I appreciate your stickin' your neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
Fancies himself a gambler, huh?
I also gotta win.
If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever.
The name is Lonnegan.
Don't have much choice, do ya?
It isn't any better.
I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
So could Shaw.
You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.
I am after this race.
You got a system, Carver?
I'm in.
What is this?  That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
Had a little fight with a raggle down on 13th.  She got me with her ring.
I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
Come on, gimme a break.
Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper.
Darling, you can't go through any more of this.  Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.
You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
Nothing.
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
Aren't you Nick Charles?
tried him once -
What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
He's been dead for three months.
Yes, she would.
If you think it'll be all right.
A new invention?
Only in bad weather.
Better get home before it is.
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
I'm very interested in that body.
Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.
know.  But I saw him -
I'll have to try to remember.
I thought it might be.  From now on, they're going to think that every thin man over six feet with white hair is Wynant.
Yeah. Couldn't find a thing. This is the way we figure it.  Wynant goes to Julia's apartment. He finds Morelli there... sees she's two- timing him.  They have a fight. But he figures he don't want to do anything then.... Morelli might squeal.  So he goes away. He don't let his lawyer know anything has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to Julia to give to him, so that Julia will think it's all blown over. Then, when she don't expect it... he lets her have it.
Nothing yet to cinch it.
What about Jorgensen?
Trail him!  Trail who?
Rosebreen.
When was that?
About three.
I see.
Why yes.
That's nothing.  I saw him myself.
Want to take a poke at him?
Just give me a minute....  I'll remember. I'm not stalling, Lieutenant.  You know I always come clean with you.  Gee, it'd serve me right if you had pinched me...  that's the afternoon I was.... wait, I'll show you...!
You've said that for weeks.
I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you.  Goodbye.
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
That's not for you to decide. Everybody's under suspicion - especially running off like this --  The police will want his description.  Is this a picture of him?
I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.
Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.
I'd tell you if I knew. But I'm not in this.  Ask the police.
That'd be very smart.  That'd be the smartest thing I ever did. Me that a police captain's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument.  The boys would like to have me come in and ask questions.  They'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. Now I come to you on the level. Studsy says you're on the level. Be on the level.
I am on the level. If I knew anything I'd....
She don't say she is, but I figure she is -
Thank you.  Now I'll tell you why I know Wynant didn't commit those murders -  Three months ago - the night that he caught you in Julia's apartment, he found out that Julia was cheating him, and was splitting with some man.  He went to find the man. That man was.... Tanner, don't you...?
I had him out this morning.
Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
Six Martinis.  You're not going to have anything on me.
Take it easy.
At breakfast.
I'll get some towels. 
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
Yes.  I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.
Your guess is as good as mine.
I've got hunch.  I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.
Say you're the one who got me in this!
Goodbye, darling.
Yup.  Don't you want something to eat?
I remembered that Wynant had some shrapnel in his shin.  It often bothered him.  So I looked for it and I found it.  Gimme.
Why not?
I want to lie low till I get the whole dope.  I don't want to go off half-cocked.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to get the real murderer. I've got an idea.  Want to see me take him?
Got a nice evening dress?
Thank you, Mrs. Charles.
I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.
You worked here?
Police!
You shouldn't let that keep you from telling truth, Mimi.  Mrs. Jorgensen -  Were you ever divorced from Chris Jorgensen?
Yes.  Nick!
I know I left them there.
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
You did.
Please, I beg of you.  The American army is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill me.
Can you eat it?  If you can't eat it I really don't care what it is.
It's a fortune box.
I'd settle for being alive.  Really. Alive would be fine.
How tough you have to be to make the army?  All you've got to do is shoot a gun, and stop a bullet.
Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.
Break it out.
You just go when I say go.
Got to be some kind of landmark; something distinctive.
I told you:  When I straighten someone out they stay straightened.  This is how it works:  Nobody touches the gold. Except when we're on the move and someone's carrying it, nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it. Agreed?
Then get up and do something about it.
He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
I told you.  He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us.
He...he could have been watching us.
We're at war.
I out rank you, that's why.
We thought--
Wes--
Look, I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?
Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy.
But we all got to be in for this.  We all go, or we do nothing.
Yeah.  I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it?  I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray.  All tricked out and cherry.  I'm going to be so sweet.
What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?
It's not about being fun.  It's about being smart.  You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about.
I steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!
...I know.
We leave it.
Yeah.  I know.  I'm with you.
I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool!
Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that.
But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.
We're not going to do anything.
I feel air.  Probably opens up outside somewhere.  That's where the light comes from.  Couldn't see it with the lanternon.
It stays as it is.  We're halfway home now.  Let's not blow it by people getting ideas.
We'll find our way!  We'll...
We need something:  A flare, a signal mirror.
We'll lie.
That helicopter passes, and the only thing we're close to is death.
I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold.
It's all right.  I don't like it, but it's over now.
I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.
Yeah, but we made that deal while Wes was still alive.  He's gone.  Time for a new deal.
Hell, they'll probably just surrender to us.  Probably.
I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
When did you make the switch?
We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of Iraqi.
Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Yes.
People are suffering.
I'm just trying to help you guys out.  It doesn't hurt to know something about Saudi Arabia.
Don't even try it.  You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.
Yeah, you're funny.
You really think there's a treasure inside?
You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.
What!?
The only thing I worry about is how much Iraqi ass I'm going to be able to kick before this whole thing is over.  The only people who I've got anything to worry about are the poor, dumb camel jockeys who don't know enough to get out of the way when I come rolling at them; an M-16 in each hand, and a grenade between my teeth.  Now if you'll excuse me, soldier, I'd like to get back to my box.  I've got a treasure to find.
It's a container.  Break the seal.
We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we get what we came for.
That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
Probably would've too if Epps wasn't around to stop you.
I think we found something.
The white reflects the sun; it keeps you cooler.  That's why they wear them.
Correct.  Origin?
Correct.  Now secure a sinex drop reading.
You know I don't feel well.
What?...Oh, no, THX.  That's not true.  Not satisfied?  THX, I need you so much.
It's 3+27 hundred
No!  Don't go.
Promise...please don't THX leaves the room.
No....I though  I'm afraid.
Don't let them separate us.
AH UGH.
It's the end.
I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
We're leaving.
Impossible!
Out of a random selection of 150 locations with 150 possible sightings, there were 146 absolute negatives and four conditionals, most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages of the experiment and can be largely discounted.
You have to!....I'm 1138 THX Magnum manipulator 347 cell 94107 Precinct 3 Residence:  Level 6421 Complex 12 Ramp 5.  Roommate 3417 LU...H.
Oh, That!  I'm 5555 SRT Entron..
All the insides are gone!
No......  She's dead THX........
Look more closely.
Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
What do you mean?
That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.
This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?
Sounds like terrorist heaven.
Stay to your left.
What's wrong?
Make up your mind, trigger.
It's from an IRA.
Nothing. Maybe they gave up, split town.
Alex-
Stay here.
Son-of-a-bitch... my nose... This fuck-up is interfering with-
No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.
What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
What was it this time?
Quiet!
It's detonation cord, for a bomb.
I know.
So you lost a handbag, madame?
Diamonds all over.
A man in love, completely shaken. He sits on bed, thinks, then takes telephone slowly, decisively.
I said, "Come in." And there he was. A fine-looking man with a moustache and long sideburns. He said, "Good evening. I'm the doctor." I said, "Doctor?" He said, "Yes, the doctor. I came to see about your tonsils."
Well--then it must be my mistake.  I beg your pardon.
But before I say goodbye I want to ask you one question: Have you ever been in Venice?
Let me tell you, Venice <u>can't</u> <u>compare</u> with Constantinople.
And harems ... ?
Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
I don't want to see you at all!
You can trust me.
Yes, Baron. Thank you. 
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
Examination! M'sieu Laval, what are you insinuating? I have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. How long have you enjoyed Madame's confidence? Three weeks, I believe.
Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron--
What do you mean?
Just call me Gaston.
No, Captain, I tell you--
Disappointed?
You're very welcome.  Countess, believe me, before you left this room I would have told you everything ... And let me say this with love in my heart-- Countess, you are a thief.  The wallet of the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine is in your possession. I knew it very well when you took it out of my pocket.  In fact, you tickled me.  But your embrace was so sweet ... 
I'm crazy about you.  By the way, your pin.
Gaston Monescu.
Gaston!
And we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married!
He recognized you!
Hello ... Is this the Spanish consulate? This is Doa Ignacio Fernandez.  My husband and I are leaving tonight for Berlin ... Is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? Thank you, thank you.  How long will it take you?
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
Don't you dare lie to me!  I know you love me.  Well, why don't you say something? Come on--be brilliant. Talk yourself out of it--bluff yourself in!  Shut up, you liar, you!  That's what I want!  This is real! Money! Cash!
Leave me alone! You were willing to sacrifice a hundred thousand francs for her.  Well--  she's worth it! [ You were willing to pay a hundred and twenty-five thousand for a <u>handbag</u>. You can pay a <u>hundred</u> thousand for him!]
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
No, no, no!  I disagree with you completely! I tried it once--
As you like. 
Oh? 
I see.  She must have been very happy here.
And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
Goodbye.
But attractive--
I'm crazy about you!
Please! 
You have been robbed--for years. And not a hundred thousand francs, but millions. And you know who did it? Adolph.
Adolph J. Giron.
Naturally not. But I expect the police to believe it. 
Yes--uh--
I know!
You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?
To me he seems rather nervous.
So he wouldn't be confined so much to his office--
Oh, madame, you're just too sweet for words! 
I don't want your money!
An hour, two at most.
You're certain?
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.
That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it.
Rose Calvert.
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
All part of my charm, Ruth. At any rate, it was my darling fiancee's beauty rituals which made us late.
I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.
I was tired.
No caviar for me, thanks.  Never did like it much.
I don't know what she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine.
If you don't shut that hole in yer face, there'll be one less in this boat!
Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?
Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice- fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice- fishing's where you chop a hole in the --
I've got you. I won't let go.
Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
No, no! Just with her hands.
Sure. If you like.
No wait. Let me try to get this out. You're amazing... and I know I have nothing to offer you, Rose. I know that. But I'm involved now. You jump, I jump, remember? I can't turn away without knowin' that you're goin' to be alright.
He does landscapes.
To the stars.
Right.
Right.
I promise.
Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
It's been 84 years... and I can still smell the fresh paint. The china had never been used. The sheets had never been slept in.
Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
Will you leave me alone?
I'm just commencing to enjoy this trip.
We'll save you a place at our table.
No-o!
I'll bet a couple of hundred.
I'll lay odds you get a pair of 'em--Why, a high-school kid could take you saps--and another thing--Lay off Sally Marsh.  --"Honest Jack"! One look at your mug and the whole world buttons up its pockets.
You work too fast for me, young man.
--you want to adopt him!--Good for you!
But I'll have cocktails with you.
Thanks.
Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
We'll let it go at that--
You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.
Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
I'll give you half of it.  Here's seventy cents. 
Looks like he's taking a trip--see the baggage? The only time they ever picked me up, McKinney walked through the room while they were grilling--let's see how good his memory is.
Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?
Well, I had to get some dough to play with those suckers. Here, get this changed.
Yes, Mr. Brett--right away.
Thank you, sir. 
<U>Me</U>!
Sure! McKinney will never suspect you--
Think again--
Why?
Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening--even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?
You keep out of this--  You admit you thought of killing him--how were you going to do it?
Tell you what I'll do.  I'll toss you for her--heads she plays with me.
Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.
If you hadn't agreed--I was going to throw you overboard-- 
Wait a minute--What <U>is</U> next month?
No. <U>Knots</U>!
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
Yeah--
Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--
All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!
Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--
Eh?... Oh.
The country boy's about due.
You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
Thanks to me.
You didn't have a gun in your hand last night?
Do you think Lother could have seen it?
Well--get a move on yer--then get back to yer station.
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers-
Well I'm the man to see.  Besides Sheriff I'm also tax collector, Captain of the Fire Brigade, and Chairman of the Non-partisan Anti- Chinese league.  A man of many Parts.  Got a place to stay yet?  I Also sit on the Townlot Commission.  Got a couple of Lovely cottages coming up for Rent.  Here, let me show you...
My man?  You told Wyatt you'd Disarmed those men.  Do you Actually believe after that I Could see you as my man?  You're Just a dirty little fixer.
I asked where you got him.
Come and get him.
We're gonna get along just fine.
I know.  Just did what you had to. That banner and stuff, that's Just Ike.  Don't worry about it.
Ecentus stultorum magister.
In pace requiescat.
Bless you, darling  Darling!  Are you mad?  You're not Wearing a bustle.  How lewd!
I been having the boy at the Hotel pack us up every night Since your streak started
Yes, but there's just something About him.  Something around The eyes, I don't know, reminds me Of... me.  No.  I'm sure of it, I Hate him.
Better.
Not exactly...
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house.
But who was the Devil?
I see.  And what would you do if "she" walked in her right now? WYATT "She"?
You know damn well who I mean. That dusky-hued lady Satan.
Don't touch me, God damn it!  Just Don't touch me!  Come on...
A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it.  He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it.  And it drives him mad. Sick mad.  Cold and dirty.
How you feelin', Doc?
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?
All right.  Then what?
Run.  Take that girl and start Running.  Run and don't look back. All your life you been running And looking back and just barely Existing and calling it getting By.  This time run and don't look Back and call it living.  Live Every second, live it right up to The hilt.  Live, Wyatt...  Live for me.
Wyatt, are you crazy?
I know.  Me neither.
Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That Means lucky.
I laugh sometimes
Fortuitous even.
I hate Sadie.
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy.
I think I'll just lie down awhile
They're just lonely is all.  Hell, I howl myself sometimes.
Oh, all right.
All right, well, good night.
Yeah, well, I swore a lot of things.
Isn't there anything I can say That'll change your mind?  You're Gonna stay with your new friends?
Look, I got a rule.  I don't talk To lawmen.  Dog-catchers neither.
Lotta law around here.  Just met the Sheriff.
That didn't sound like thunder.
Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.
That a fact?
They're nothing.  They're nobody. I want the Cowboys.  All of 'em.  I Mean to break 'em up, drive 'em Out of the territory.
Sure...
Well here we are a family again. Been so long plain forgot how Good it feels.  Want to thank you For that, Wyatt.  All your doin'.
So to speak.
Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor?
No, damn it, it's wrong, they're Breakin' the law.
What do they say in Russia, General Bukharin? 
Excuse me, but -  I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6.  This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.
Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
Come. Let's get out of the noise.  - I'll give you a tour of the building, then we'll talk.
Fantastic idea Mr. Bond! Perhaps I should buy it for a book! It's totally preposterous, but -  You amuse me. ...And now perhaps I can amuse you.
Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of London.'  ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond?
Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor...  And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -
Him? He, is a she -  at the bar.
Four o'clock. M will meet you in the conference room.
Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have you ever known me to kiss and tell?
- We all want what we can't have?
Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road.  All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns -  Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse -  Stop that!  Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.
Standard equipment. The world's automobile manufacturers seem to be in some kind of mad war to see who can provide the most beverage cup holders.
Do you?
I see...
Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.
Not if you kill us first - unless that's how you plan to leave Muffy.
I'm not certain... But I think there's someone I want to press for some answers in Kuala Lumpur.
Happily.
I see my date is here.  And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.
Nice to run into you again.
What?
Listen to me! I'm a British secret service agent. And we have about two minutes before Harmsway kills both of us.
The only mistake is that they didn't kill us in the elevator.
First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine.
It seems, 007, we've received a tip
Of course.
Hopefully, it won't get that far.
Forget it. No way. I got here first.
Who's Wade?
No.
Pencil it in for the next trip -
The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -
No -
My timing always was lousy.
You come with me -  You stay here.
No. I have a better idea. In fact, Mr. Bond may have actually improved my original plan.  Bring them both to Hong Kong. And Make sure he has nothing else up his sleeve.
Who is it?
Since when?
We got the same thing.
Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.
Maybe I can get down there next week.
I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain.
Why in the h...
It was nip and tuck.
And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
He will be alright.
I'm going back home with Harry.
Anytime you need someone to do something for you, just let me know.
I'm not here to argue, sir.
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.
Hush.
It would be nice.
How is the garden doing?
How is that hen doing? I was meaning to pip her before I fell sick.
I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
He knows better. Sunny, apologize to Harry.
Everything these days is made overseas.
You're suppose to teach your children what you know. Junior, I don't have to worry about. Babe Brother is a different story.
You still call him boy. You call Babe Brother boy in front of his wife and son.
She has a fish bone caught in her throat. Could all of you go in the other room? Gideon, get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil.
Let me get you a cup?
You invited me.
You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
Girl, do you still sing and dance?
Why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone? I remember when you weren't saved. That was way back yonder when the Natchez Trace was just a dirt road.
Oh. I'm sorry. Gideon, what do you say?
Counting the gray hairs in your head.
I planted a row just for you and you don't owe me anything.
Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom!
Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!
Okay...
Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!
Let's let Molly open one.
Rocky!  The ramp!
Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.
Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!
Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!
Don't you get it?!  You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!! 
Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
But why would Andy want me?
It's ok.  Everything's under control.
NO-O-O-O-O-O-O!!
The match!
Ha ha!!  To Infinity and Beyond!!
Plus is positive, minus is negative! Oh, let me!
I can't see a thing!
Murderer!
Did I get my package in the mail?
Patient is...  ...pre-e-epped.
Oh, ya big lizard!  Now we'll never know what it is!
Have you been replaced?
Alright!  That's it!
Come on.  Let's get out of here.
Hey look!  It's Buzz!
Wait!  There's a nice little one over there!
Oh, I don't like confrontations.
Last present!
Uh-oh.
I knew you'd come back, Woody!
I did like the music.
Slip up and change into a skirt, else he'll create something terrible. Don't you want to make a good impression on your first day?
Home is where the heart is.
I can't go home because there's no home left.
Living with him put years on me.
What difference does <i>that</i> make?
All the time.
We're too young.
I wanted my Leda to be a little girl. Leda and the swan. See?
Like I said, open container, P.I., Misdemeanor possession.  Easy to make it disappear.  For you, poof, it's gone.
How much?
Arnie, this is crazy.
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
Helena, if I had it I would give it to you, but I don't have that kind of money.
I was just waiting for the right time.
We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing.
Honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments.  I tried --
Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
So's the video camera.
She'll be at a pawn shop in an hour.
Are you going to?
What's up?
We watched his father get dragged away by federal agents.  I don't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you're coming back... Or if you're coming back.
Somehow, I don't see that happening.
Will we get invited to the White House?
How are your grades?
I'm third in my class.
He's gonna fucking die right here on the kitchen floor --
Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
Have you done your homework, honey?
Nope.
I have dreams about this, actual dreams about busting the top people, the rich people, the white people.
Winners don't do coke.  Or haven't you been reading the bumper stickers?
The amount of coke we got on you means capital punishment in some states.
We can protect you.
He hired you.  That was a mistake.
I don't know, sir.
It should be... It's yours.  I want our debt forgiven.  I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States.  And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.
I don't know.  Something.
They wouldn't do it in front of all these people.  They'd send someone later, when we're alone.
Then I guess I'm going by myself.
Your new friends.
I feel like a traitor.
If I can.
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
A small thing.  Nothing really.
We sometimes went downtown to score.
What?  I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.
Your dad's a doctor.  Call him --
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's all --
You were in my way.
I'm a fugitive from the law. I can't be seen on the fucking streets. Now watch my lips. Kempton Park. Two-thirty. Five pounds to win. Bad Boy.
And that's what's illegal. Do you know what they do to people like me inside? They'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet.
Easy for you to say.
That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.
What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?
Exactly. I'm not wanting a cat, she says. Get to fuck, right. So there's Tommy stuck with this kitten. You can imagine what happened. The thing was neglected, pissing and shitting all over the place. Tommy was lying around fucked out of his eyeballs on smack or downers. He didn't know you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit.
I didn't either. What the fuck is it?
Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?
No, I'll wash them. I'll take them home and bring them back.
But try too hard --
Director?
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
I'm cooking' up. There is a silence.
Well, Christ, if I'd known you were going to get so humpty about it, I wouldn't have bothered. Are you going to eat that?
About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ---------- }
So he met me and I offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price, with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy I know in London.
Excellent.
In that case --
Sounds great, Swanney.
You'll have to send us a postcard.
It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?
Doesn't it make you proud to be Scottish?
No joy yet.
She read it in Cosmopolitan.
But where?
No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --
And how did you breach the Barrier?
With a starship!
Bring it closer so that I might join with it. Do it, or watch these puny things die horribly.
It runs deep. Share it with me.
And we can't see a thing. Request you direct us to the coordinates.
This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking. You are in violation of Neutral Zone Treaty. I advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences.
Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.
I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?
What is it you seek?
I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
Then we'll have to get them out the old fashioned way.
Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.
And that is?
I don't understand.
What do you mean?
Be one with the horse.
An eternity during which we'll be vulnerable to Klingon attack. Korrd-you tell him.
Is what possible?
"a"... "n"...uh, "d"... end of word.
The only problem is, it's up there. We're down here.
Uh-uh.
Not possible. You were never alone.
I'll take you to the bridge.
I've done nothing. This is who they are. Didn't you know that?
But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
Given to me by God.  He waits for us on the other side.
"Embezzling" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey...  No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.
Boy, I sit up there grindin' away all day, and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun.
Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
Yes...but you have to go roundtrip, and you must purchase your program at least 30 days in advance. Hah!
It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
Ok
I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.
I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right --
When you've been in the system as long as I have, you hear many promises... many reassurances...many brave plans...
Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
You're alive!
Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here.
Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...
Strategic Air Command.
Another free program off line.  What's his User s'posed to do -- ?
They'd better be...I don't want to bust outta this dump an' find nothin' but a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me.
We have to.
Oh, Tron... I knew you'd escape... they've never built circuit that could hold you...
Then I owe you some thanks...
Why?  So I can wind up like you? What's the point?
Yes.
In the helicopter.
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
Got it.  Nice touch.  Okay, pick me up at eight.  The de-brief is at ten hundred.
See, that's the problem with terrorists.  They're really inconsiderate when it comes to people's schedules.
It can't be.  Not Helen.
You know about that?
You're not going anywhere.
And you still reach for your piece every time.
Yes sir.
I agree.
Juno.  I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you again.
Me too.
I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?
What'd you do, honey?
I don't know anything about a faction.  I just met Simon...  or whatever his name is...  a couple of weeks ago.  I barely know him.
You're in a lot of trouble, Mrs. Tasker, so I suggest you cooperate.  If we want to know the most intimate details of your life, you'd better tell us.
Answer the question--
Louder please.
No one must know!  Especially him.  You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing.  The security of this nation depends on it.  Can you do that?
I'm not wearing any.
My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?
Did you pork her Harry?
Doesn't matter.  I like change. You know, constant turnover.  As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.
Some kinda legal secretary of something.  Married to some boring jerk.
Hold that thought.
I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.
I'm sorry, I can't.
What is it you need me to do?
Knock wood.
Get it.
Now hang up.
It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.
The oriental.
Is that your real name? Really?
I took a cab.
Would you like to get some pie?
How 'bout me what?
There's nothing to tell.
Turn-offs?
Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out.
How long have you worked here?
Five.
Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.
Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.
Who and what is a Drexl?
You will?
You better not be fuckin' teasin' me.
Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
What?
I'm gonna hop in the tub and get all wet, and slippery, and soapy. Then I'm gonna lie in the waterbed, not even both to dry off, and watch X-rated movies till you get your ass back to my lovin' arms.
You ain't kiddin', we got lives to start over, we should go somewhere where we can really start from scatch.
That rhymes.
Naw naw!
You don't like it, but you eat that shit.  He eats it.
Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to kill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.
If I thought I could get away with it -
Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".
I'm her husband.
No thanks? What does that mean? Means you ate before you came down here? All full. Is that it? Naw, I don't think so. I think you're too scared to be eatin'. Now, see we're sittin' down here, ready to negotiate, and you've already given up your shit. I'm still a mystery to you. But I know exactly where your ass is comin' from. See, if I asked you if you wanted some dinner and you grabbed an egg roll and started to chow down, I'd say to myself, "This motherfucker's carryin' on like he ain't got a care in the world. Who know? Maybe he don't. Maybe this fool's such a bad motherfucker, he don't got to worry about nothin', he just sit down, eat my Chinese, watch my TV." See? You ain't even sat down yet. On that TV there, since you been in the room, is a woman with her titties hangin' out, and you ain't even bothered to look. You just been starin' at me. Now, I know I'm pretty, but I ain't as pretty as a couple of titties.
Get the fuck outta here!
Believe it or not, I actually tricked a girl into falling in love with me. I'm not quite sure how I did it. I'd hate to have to do it again. But I did it. Wanna say hi to my better half?
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.
For the very first time in my life.  Do you know what that's like?
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
Yeah?
Yeah, let's just get outta here.
I don't blame you.  So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?
Yeah, OK.
What do you think, eightball?
Sure. I didn't hear anything.
No problems on both counts.
Get on your knees.
I can see what you mean.
Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable. This is "Doctor Zhivago". This'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine.
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always "OK", "No problem", "You're a busy guy, I understand". The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems.
That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?
Keep it.
Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.
I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.
That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?
I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
Sure was.
Or a bit player -
Which wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid.
Look in the hamper. Linda's been dumpin' everybody's stray clothes there lately.
- Because it's good!
Yeah, I live here.
No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember.
I went to the surface and I collected specimens like I was told.
You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole?  Have it taken away?
Cole, did you or did you not record that message?
You're still a little... disoriented.
I got into trouble.  I got arrested. But I still got you a specimen -- a spider -- but I didn't have anyplace to put it, so I ate it.  It was the wrong year anyway, so I guess it doesn't matter.
Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind.
I have to go.
No, 1995 is the past.
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
It's the next step.  I checked out the Baltimore information, it was nothing. It's Philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone.  Zs that a radio?  Does it play music?
I did him a favor.  Now come on.
Jeffrey Mason?
Give me the gun.
IT WASN'T A TV SHOW!  IT WAS REAL!
A Carpet Cleaning Company?
No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.
Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.
I've managed to contact certain underlings, evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and assorted minions, who will contact my father. When he learns I'm in this kind of place, he'll have them transfer me to one of those classy joints where they treat you...properly. LIKE A GUEST!  LIKE A PERSON!  SHEETS! TOWELS!  LIKE A BIG HOTEL WITH GREAT DRUGS FOR THE NUT CASE LUNATIC MANIAC DEVILS...
Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load!  Listen up -- try and get it together.  Focus!  Focus!  The plan! Remember?  I did my part.
Not, "what", babe!  When!
I'm here about some monkeys.
Listen to me -- I can't do anything about what you're going to do. I can't change anything.  I can't stop you.  I just want some information...
Well, the guard woke me up.  He told me I volunteered.
I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?
Two policemen were already in the hospital and now we have an orderly with a broken arm and a Security Officer with a fractured skull.
Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...
Twelve Monkeys, honey.  Guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning.
You can't do that yourself?
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.  It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.  I don't guess I'll be seeing you again.  Take it easy.
Same back at you.
You want to make a kiddies bet?
It will.
Put your money where your chicken- lipped mouth is.  I'll bet this mornings pay I'm right.
I . . . Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
But he's dead.
Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today.
Look, pal, I've got places to be. Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Time.
Yeah, right.  Someplace in this dust bowl I can get something to drink?
I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
Hundred-fifty.
Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
You believe that?
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
Take it.  As soon as I get my money. Fifty dollars for an almost new gasket.  You don't know what kind of a deal you're getting.
Yeah, you better remember that.
You got beer?
Kirin?
Genuine Draft?
I think I burned my gun hand!
I . . .
He killed him, Sheriff!  I couldn't stop him!  He made me come with him. He told me if I said a word he would kill me too.
Who the hell is this!?
It's Grace.
Accident.
I just got tired of looking at the old drapes.  Had them long as I can remember.
I just drove in this morning.
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
From my father.  He was the tribe's Shaman.
A medicine man?
Still playing?
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
How much money has he got?
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
Lied?  What do you mean?
Jesus Christ!  Listen to yourself! I can't do it, Grace.  I can't do it.
I wanted to talk.
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
Where are you going?
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep in the garage.  Figure that way people will think maybe me and Jake went away.  Might buy us some time.
Not me.  Us.
Just drive.
The police don't know that.  And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  I'll take you as far as California.  If we can even make that.  After that I'm cutting you loose.
Yeah, they'll find you.  Dried up and twice dead.
What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so.
I'm a solid man.
What brings you to Sierra?
Another accident?  You've really got to be more careful.  Can I get you a drink?
I had a problem getting my car back.
And for that you'd kill Grace?
Just to get out of here?  That doesn't seem much for a murder.
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife . . .?
Wh . . . what are you talking about?
Come on, Jake--
Nothing happened with me and Grace this morning.
Is that what happened?  Did you even make it out to the desert, or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets?
What are you . . . you can't . . . you can't kill me.
You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table.  Now, I'm not going to ask you again, Mister.  What were you doing with my girl?
You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
How about I pick one out for you?
I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn't defending you.
But you was going to fight for me.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
How old are you?
They're not very imaginative?
Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
My honor, that's what I'm fighting over.  Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?
Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?
I'm gonna beat you so bad you gonna be eatin' nothing but soup the rest of your days.  Rain dogs is gonna be prettier than you when I'm done. I'm gonna mess you up so bad you gonna make your own momma sick.  I'm gonna . . .
A hundred and . . . Now you listen to me you deadbeat, little punk:  I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller.  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and I want it.  I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is.
What happened?
His father worked in a strip mine north of here.  Toby's school class went up to the mine one day.  School takes field trips up there every year.  Big day for the kids when they can see ore tore up out of the ground.  Anyway, on this particular day Toby's dad up and falls into the machinery.
Hell no, I can't do that myself.  I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
Who's cursed?
More or less.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
Stand up.
I wasn't sneaking around with your girl. Would you please tell him?
Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
Grace, tell him.
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
I'm not rambling.
You meant it.
Oh yeah sure. Why don't I buy you a plane ticket right out of here while I'm at it. I <u>know you</u>...  This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
I've had time to get over it.
For defending my honor this afternoon.
What's your name anyway?
So?
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
Yeah, I can fix it.
Bottom hose was shot too.  Rotted clear through. Had to put a new one in. Runs like a dream now.
"That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."
I don't know, but "it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through."  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Darrell.
That's none of your business.  Get the keys.
That's all right.  I got it.
You're welcome, Grace.
I just drove in this morning.
You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
I guess it must.
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
Guys like me take those chances. Let's go.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't. I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
Don't feel like nothing.
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
You're sick too...he loved to do things to me. Control me. My Mom...it tore her up cause she couldn't do nothing about it. She become alcoholic...and the funny thing is-- I liked it. I liked being controlled by Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as he got, I wanted <u>more</u>. I wanted to go all the way. Women say they don't want to be taken like, <u>really taken</u> -- that's bullshit -- they do. The first time he finished with me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14. Then he started crying like a baby...wanted me to hold him. It's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him, comfort him... They found my Mom right down there  at the bottom of Apache Leap. She had cactus needles stuck all over her body and Virgil...Sheriff Potter said she was drunk and went insane. But I'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident. She was born on this earth and she loved it. She was like me. She just wanted to fly away.
Oh yeah. It's beautiful, beautiful beaches. Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
If the key's on him, how do we get the key?
What about us?
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this for you.  I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.
But I thought --
Save the Mom routine, will ya Grace. It doesn't work with me. One, two, three...
Grace -- in the trunk of my car is a tow rope. It should reach down here. Go get it, throw it down.
Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.
...Now, let me get this straight. Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
The ticket is 30.55.
Sure, I'll try.
Like you helped her, Jake?
Do you see any Telletubbies around here?... Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it?... Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression sitting outside in a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put a quarter in it?... No?... Well that's what you see at a toy store? Any you must think this is a toy store, cause you're in here shopping for an infant named Jeb. One of us has made a gross error and wasted the other person's valuable time...
I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal.
You use your sleeve.
Yes.
Think carefully?
Are you for real?
You're skill.
One last question.
Consider him packed. I didn't like his attitude... Struttin around with a cane and shit.
That's great.
But I'm afraid of water, so that's been holding my career back a little bit.
That's what I said to my son. He said, there's always two kinds. The soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands, and then there's the real threat. The brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind.
Fine.
In the passenger car?
...And everyone lived happily ever after.
I'm not going out anymore. I'm not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you.
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
What wife? He don't have no wife.
Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.
Me? No. No, I guess not.
She back in Kansas?
Uh... yeah. Yeah. She's uh... watchin' over the little ones.
Shit and fried eggs.
Uh... a little, maybe.
Heard you done the roof yourself.
Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...
Well, uh... it ain't loaded.
Well he wasn't gonna wait for Corky to grow no new hand. He walked over real close, bein' drunk, an' shot him through the liver.
Is... is it... loaded?
No he ain't. He went South yesterday.
A sign on him?
Hold on, mister.  Son, this here pig gotta be moved outta this pen, away from them others. Penny, you give yer brother a hand...
Oh.
Bein' my partner. I'm headin' North up around the Niobrara in Nebraska. Gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.
Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
Well... I don't recollect.
Yeah, he's in there.
You can shoot him.
First one I ever killed.
Lemmee see it.
Wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.
Yeah?
How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?
We done stuff before for money, Ned.
Two weeks, I guess.
She gave me the evil eye.
No. I mean...  ...an' get yourself a woman? You know?
Not for me. I don't touch it no more.
I know it's rainin',  Give the Kid a drink, why dontcha?
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
You still think it'll be easy shootin' them cowboys?
I seen him.
Two.
Supposin' he don't go to the ranch?
Three.
Five. I killed five of 'em.  That counts a Mexican I killed.  He come at me with a knife.
I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!
You can stop looking. There was no coke. I've been in L.A. county with a guy they
He says they were buying It doesn't make sense. I'm sorry, I'm a little rusty. They were there to buy something.
I love you.
Umm ...
I don't know. This is bad.
Why you gotta go and do that? I'm trying to make a point.
We all go. How about it, Keaton?
The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity.
I did you a favor by standing up for you last night, but don't think we're friends. I'm sorry, but I have other things -
Never heard of him.
Okay, okay. You say it's the real thing? That's cool.
Forget it.  I'11 probably shit blood tonight.
Hungarian?
I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser.
What about Redfoot?
I've got a ton of work and no good people.
We want to meet him.
A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
This won't be an' interrogation, just a... friendly chat to kill time.
I know he was good.
Keaton was a piece of shit.
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?
I know Ruby. He's very big on respect. Likes me very much.
I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York.
Then why didn't you help him?
But Keaton...
I never heard of him.
No, Verbal. You weren't friends. Keaton didn't have friends. He saved you because he wanted it that way. It was his will.
I'm fine.
No -- we don't want this case in court.
Yes.
Gruber...
You know what that would mean?  To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr.Marx, of course...
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear.  Isn't that what you did?
My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...
Tell us.
...of Anesthesiology?
Thank you, your Honor.  Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.  As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
And wasn't that an oath...?  These are your initials here:  K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath.  No less important than that which you took today.   Isn't that right?   Isn't that right...?
Because I kept a copy.  I have it right here.
I'm going to win this case...Mist...Mr. Doneghy...I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps.  Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
It was good of you to meet...
Yes...I...yes.
No.  No.  Thank you. You go home.
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anaesthetic...the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
Negligent.  Yes...it would have been criminal.  But that was not the case.
What are they going to do?  Not invite me to their Birthday party ...?   Look, I gotta go.  I have to be in Cambridge ...
Well, maybe you better do that, then.   You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores.  You'd do anything for a dollar.  You got no loyalty...no nothing...you're a bunch of whores.
I'm sure it is, Frank:  and let me tell you something.  If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?   See my point?  Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
I had a witness disappear on me.
Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue.  Dr. Thompson.  Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar.  Representing my client. My client, do you understand?  You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
Exception!
I have to reach him.  This is an emergency.  Could you give me his home number?
Let me talk to Mickey.
Pardon?
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
And what are you?  A cop?
Yes.  It was, actually.
Is this a bad time.
You're going to stay here...?
That's what I am.
Yes.
You do what you want.  You want to leave...You want to go kill yourself?
You told me so.  Maybe you'd get some sympathy.  You came to the wrong place.
Is there going to be a later...?
No...no...
No.
What are you going to do?
What the hell do you think you're doing ...?  What's going on here ...?
Fuck you.  I got a call today from Sally Doneghy ...
Don't touch anything.
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Yeah.  I'm awake.
...one of the other nurses?
We got to talk.
... I understand ...
My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
I, what are you talking about?  I talked to her this morning, and she said...
That's a wonderful profession.  My daughter-in-law's a nurse.  What did you do, stop?
Yeah.
I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you. They're dependable, good boys --
But you knew about this.
Oh, yes. You noticed the way she does her hair.
She is not my wife.
I -- I --
Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.
My name is John Ferguson, and --
What about?
Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
But before! Where did you live before!?!
No.
Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.
We'll take it! Will it fit?
Ah, no!
That's what I had in mind.
No, Ernie's is fine.
All in good time.
Oh, yeah. There.
Go up the stairs, Judy.  I'll follow.
You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?
My name is John Ferguson.
The first time I've been grateful for Coit Tower.
Yes...
Home?
And you'll go on saving me? Again and again?
No... it's in shadow.
No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
Yes.
Carlotta Valdes?
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.
How long has she had the room?
Oh, no! She hasn't been here at all! I would have seen her, you know. I've been right here all the time, putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves!
In her room? Well, yes, of course if you ask. But it does seem silly...
Tomorrow... the corset comes off. And this thing goes out the window.  I shall be a free man. I shall wiggle my behind... free and unconfined.
More than you think.
Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
Johnny, the doctors explained --
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
What a pleasant hobby.
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?
Out. I've got things to do.
Around.
Well, I detected an undercurrent.
Now, Judy, it isn't anything to get --
I thought so!
I didn't hear you.
You're interrupting a personal conversation.
Boyd brought up divorce statistics.
Franco mother-fucking Harris!
You're not a team player.
Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
Go home!
We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
We can't do this.
You got us into this mess.
Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head.
Don't talk to me about character.
They won't figure it out.
No...we want padded chairs...okay?
Then fuck what your father said, cause I'm gonna tell you right now...You'll know what it's all about, why you got married and why you love her when you wake up at three in the morning, and the streetlight's coming through the window and it's just catching a corner of her face, like a sleeping angel. And her hair smells sweet and she's your's. She's all your's. Do you see where I'm going here?
I know and I'm honored...
Where's the bathroom?
Tomorrow.  We are getting married tomorrow.
Don't sweet lip me.
I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...
Doing the bachelor party thing?
We can take her out to Red Rock. Find some quiet place...and put her in the ground.
Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...
I can't.
I think we should say some words over the grave.
Say it again.
What you just said. Say it again.
Suck my ass.
Now?
Hold on a sec.  Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning?
I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!
Whatever you say Kojak.
I'm serious.
I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!
I never heard that.
Moore?
You hate women.
What's your point?
They need leadership.
That's what I'm saying. Let the Israelis straighten it up. They got plenty of room down there, number one. Plus, and this is just a plus, they kind of look alike - the Jews and the Mexicans. So I think on a whole your average Joe Mexican is gonna have less of a problem getting his head around the whole assimilation thing. Am I right?
The wedding cake check?
Yup.
Why?
I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
Charles Moore for instants.
With all my heart.
More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.
I will.
Well you should.
I'll see you tomorrow...
How late?
What about the chairs?
Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
It's too late.
The only proof is those bodies.
What?
You put him down or don't bother coming back.
I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, "My son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me...My boy is just like me." Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me.
I love you so much it hurts. Me and your mother marvel at what you have become. You're going to have a wonderful journey with this girl. I feel it deep inside. A wonderful, magical journey.  And I'm, like I said, just so proud of how you turned out.  You go out and knock 'em dead Keith. Knock'em dead!
Yeah, Dad. It's great.
Well, I'm in the middle of my Goddamn toast here.
I think so.
Did he try to kiss you?
I kind of like "till death do us part." I mean, this is forever. In sickness and in health, through good times and bad. Honey, what do you think?
I do.
The stone age.
The post-Vegas Man.
Okay boys, smile!
Are you guys gonna fill this place with kids? You sure got room for them.
I don't think that's a good idea.
Then I'll get you in the fields tomorrow ...
Tell me the answer to this! What bird lays eggs in a barn?
To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...
No, Uncle, and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although I didn't think so at first, you are really a good man.
Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I'll ...
Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
There are some curtains and drapes, but they're all very old.
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
I'll be ready.
Very, very?
Yes -- very, very big!
You little liar! Get out of here!
I don't want to leave the convent, Mother.
I have nothing to reproach myself for. All I know is that I've changed. With all my strength, which is not much, I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me. One can also serve outside a convent.
Are you aware of the pride there is in what you're saying?
When you are, miss.
Right, let's go.  And keep the compliments to yourself. I don't like them.
Can you tell us what's on the disc?
Look, I feel bad about this, so I'm going to try to look into the programming of his Maestro teaching tool for you.  ) I've had one sitting around for years. Maybe I can learn something that you'll find useful.
Catch him and your record's clean.
He was a computer program for crissake.
Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first.  New scar  you making it okay in there?
Where's my gun?
Not if you're with him every step of the way.
Only because I got pulled out early.
Nobody else ever got anywhere near him. Nobody else... understands him like you do.
He hears...everything.
As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away.
Don't worry. Through me, you will live forever...
Go to hell.
It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.
What you need is a collar.
Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.
As a matter of fact, it is.
She's beautiful, you know?
I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
Then why don't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while?
I don't know.
Where did you plant the C-4?!
Let's just say I'm sending a very clear message to his ReElection Rally...
What if he's busy tonight?
It's <u>producing</u>.
I could tell you stories:  Cecil B. Demille:  Alright? The Greatest Show on Earth:  He needs an elephant,
They got the guys on a <u>retainer</u>, it's cheaper, <u>pay</u>'em, but don't lettem touch it... Let'em leave us alone.
Hi, How are ya?  <u>Listen</u> to this, willya...
It's the gratitude of your <u>party</u>, and of your <u>President</u>...
Look, look, look....  He's fine, as long as he has his medication.
You know, I think you people are looking at this All Wrong.  If you look at the <u>backstory</u> -- the guy's coming back from Combat and Torture.  Of <u>course</u> he is gonna be ... uh ... uh ... "fucked up".  Of <u>Course</u> he's gonna "need a little help"... 
Come on.
...where?
How do we explain that?  Ah, well, you see, Wilfred, this is where you've never been at a <u>pitch</u>.  You see? His <u>records</u> say he was in prison ... as they must, as <u>all</u> the records of Group 303 have the men and the women, carried on their roster, as belonging somewhere else, the <u>secrecy</u> required of....
What rig?
He's <u>dead</u>.  He's <u>dead</u>.  The Fella Killed Old Shoe. 
Okay.  And she's alleging...?
It won't hold.
<u>Do</u> it...
One day, Two days?  <u>Course</u> it's gonna hhhh....
What in the <u>world</u> would do that?
I'm working on it.
We can't <u>afford</u> a war.
The American "people"?
Yes
Who's gonna tell'em.
What did they find out about the Gulf War?  One shot: one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been made of <u>Legos</u>.
What do you know about them?
Precisely.
...you want us to go to War with Albania.
<u>Hello</u>... Yes.  We'll be back...?
...this's <u>good</u>...
...uh huh...
Now, the Old Lady starts to <u>Weep</u>, Big Bird shrugs off his secret <u>Service</u>, goes to her, and covers her with his own coat.
Find out is there <u>any</u> chance we can get some rain tomorrow, <u>will</u> you...?
Speaking of thanks... we puttem back in, what does your fellow Moss want?
Due in Nashville.
We're gonna do the <u>Team Song</u>.
How's your wife?
Fine. 
Guess what?  We show, and N.S.A. confirms, there <u>are</u> no nuclear devices on the Canadian border.  There are no nuclear devices in Albania.  Z'at put us in something of a pickle?  Albania <u>has</u> no nuclear capacity.  Our spy satellites show "no secret terrorist camps" in The Albanian Hinterland.  The F.B.I. and the Border Patrol, And the R.C.M.P. report no repeat no untoward activity along our picturesque Canadian Border.  The Albanian Government is screaming its innocence, the world is listening.  There is no War.
Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
And I think that the Security of the Country would be best-served by its citizens obeying its laws.  Gemme a Federal Judge, gemme search-warrants, all premises controlled by our friends, and bench-warrants for the two of...
THE GROUP WATCHING TELEVISION.
From whence did it come?  Our information states it came from a small group of armed, dissidents.  Of Armed and Violent Dissidents...
ON THE PRESSCORP, THE REPORTERS, LISTENING WIDEMOUTHED, TO THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.
Six to five and pick'em...you wanna <u>chance</u> it...
S'only got to hold for another few days.
I'm interested in the Security of My Country, Mr. Brean.
Is that true?
Well, no, well, you couldn't <u>tell</u> any...
They got to have something that we want.
Why would they want that?
...there gonna be any money in this thing?
At the Airport?  Cause we decided at the Airport he hugs the fat, wet Albanian Broad, we...
The War is Over.  Senator Nole just ended the War.
I saw it on TV.
In the Folk Music Section.  We'll be in in...
Oh, he's gonna be Aces.
Oh, you're gonna love this:
You do your job right, nobody should notice.
S'only when you fuck up, everything gets full of shit.  Do you think we could line him up for the Peace Prize?
...that's right.
Hey, lemme close out the thing in style.
Hey, lcokit:  <u>any</u> business...
I got it in the inaugural.  "Thank you for voting for me, but, <u>as</u> importantly:  Thank you for <u>voting</u>... 
Yeah, well, perhaps...  Speaking of which:  I have a <u>prescription</u> here, I'm going to give you the <u>number</u>, I need you standing by with a <u>crate</u> of the stuff.... it's ... what is it?
What <u>kind</u> of stuff?  Hello...?
How's our friend?
Eh?  I'm like the Rest of America.  I don't <u>care</u> -- I'm just <u>addicted to it</u>...
We're going home.  We're going home together...
He's doped to the <u>Gills</u> ...
No, I'm fine... I got it together....
No.  You're right.
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that, Stanley...
But you always knew you couldn't <u>take</u> the credit....
Let's take the bridge from <u>nine</u>, and the intro from <u>one</u>, and...
See y'at the Finish Line.
They look stupid.
...the pet wrangler suggested it..he's also got a...
No, no, no.... we'll punch <u>in</u> a kitten.  Um... <u>Later</u>.
...you're gonna Punch in a Kitten Later.
...just want to Get Back to the Beans...
Susie?  Susie.  Are you alright...?  <u>Susie</u>...
Tell those spineless toads we'll self-insure if they don't write it... You fire 33 vice presidents and nothing changes...  You eating twinkies today, Bud, or are you schtupping some stewardess...
Look, I know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but I'm different, I never talk to strangers, all my life I've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room... you're that person, you don't know it but I do and if you walk away now I'll never see you again or you me. You'll grow old.
I'll grow old. We'll both die. And we'll never have known each other. That's sad. At least one drink for a dreamer...What's your favorite drink?
Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
No, thank you. I knew the minute I laid eyes on you, you had what it takes Bud. Just keep it going.
...takes years of genetics, pal, and a Yale education... and the right tailor.
Great Charlie, any better it'd be a sin.
Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality...
Get the hell out!
Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive, and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm.
50 K don't get you to first base in the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I pay 40% in taxes, I got a rent of 15,000, I got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, I need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes...
Not in here Dad... please. Later.
Alright. Why so pissed?
What do I need a fancy suit for. I don't hobnob with the jet set. I just fix their planes.
Wait... next week's booked. Let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday.
No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.
Tell 'em your father gave it to you.
Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...
"What are you thinking?"...that was it. The hours are hell, but the money's starting to tumble in. I know this guy who's got an iron- clad way to make money, I can't lose and I can't get hurt.
Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.
I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...
There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.
Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.
Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it?
...Can't it wait? I'm good for it.  ...Awright. Come out, get the directions from Natalie and hurry up.
You're learning, sport...
You don't understand. I want to be surprised...astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien. Here's some inside info for you. That Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. So don't lose your place in line.  Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this. The lights coming up over the water. I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment.  ...an old Russian proverb - "a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar." I like you sport, I ever tell you that... Gordon, call me Gordon from now on.
I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.
A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fox.
Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.
Upper West Side.
Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.
You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...
Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
At least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger.
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
Harold, you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times, do you?
Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
He did?
No?
I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
No I'm serious.  It's. it's just I don't know I. I'm looking for something else.
Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.  They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.
This. is killer.
You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
Servants.  Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared
When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you
Hey.
I'll come back all the time.
Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
Nope.
Wonderful.  It's good to see you two doing so well.
I know how hard it can be sometimes.
Well, I don't think I've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last year.
Um...
She isn't here.
I've seen you.  From the window.
You do?
Thank you.
I'm sorry that I frightened you like that.  But I was so touched by your concern.  I've been lonely here.  Perhaps we could be friends.
Please leave me alone.
It's fine.
...just so she could cut them off.
Yep.
Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband, get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
M-E...
Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.
But Claire--
Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.
Like what?
Don't.
I am, really.
You know what I mean.
Tomorrow.
Of him I think.
To make sure she's all right.
Nothing's going to happen.  Besides, I have to work tonight.  The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer.  This is...
Mmnph.
I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
"...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
"...for my father."
You didn't?
It's a ghost.
She could be out.  She could be sick in bed for all we know.
Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under some strain.  But there's no such thing as ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed?
Five minutes?
What can it hurt to talk to someone?
Yes.  And he's going to get away with it.
Claire, please...
Yep.
We walked all night...
But I don't remember.
What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
Stop...
You should have tried harder.
She can't be here without me.
How can you be sure?
Do you know it?
Maybe we can stop there for lunch.
You don't have to do that.
:No, I said, I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true.
:Would you stop it!
Who can say the hope of redemption dies with our last breath...? They must see what the legacy has wrought - Diedre, withered inside herself Carlotta, killing and stunting her own flesh and blood...  surely they sense the child you carry - and the life it might lead in Lashers grasp...   Maybe, in death, they feel remorse for the evil they embraced in life...?!
Come.  There is a lot to read
NO!  she's pregnant, Aaron.  she's got that to deal with - and the clinic.. she is not to hear about this.   don't you think I know she spends half her lite worrying about me...  Listening to my heart, aren't you...?  The Timex still ticking...?
You have to warn her - this second! I'm catching the next flight back!
He made that quite clear, yes.
In certain cases, hell is the operative word.
I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -
Put your hatred for me aside, so you can clearly see what is ahead-
Why are you doing this...?  Handing out these horrors! Why...?!!
'He'...?
Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.
The door, Michael.  find the key...
FAST.
You bastard...
What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.
Only you...
You went into the cells --- and you changed them.  How...?!
Harder...
Nothing.  Absolutely nothing-
Yessssss...
It - it feels like - like I'm being filled up. crowded out of myself.   Like I'm fading away-
Nope-  My father died before I was born. My mother died in childbirth.   El1ie was my only blood relation.  so she brought me here... the day after I was born.
Mm-hmm.     Scared-  I feel a little like the moth and the flame.
You don't know what you meant -  because you don't know me.
God knows, I'm intriguing.
You could fly down tomorrow.  I could be there the next day  I think I can last that long without you.
Rowan...?
Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
And I thought I was the mindreader.
Their what...?
- we made a fire.
I don't know.
I can't leave now.  Don't ask me to explain!  I just can't!
Why bother to ask, Ro...?  Why don't you just make me stay,..?
That's a wasp.  Fuckers'll sting a tree if they're bored-  so - where is she...?
You really love this guy...?
That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.
A person could get killed round here just for working late
No -it's no problem - I do it all the time
Sure...
I think I will pass...
I'm a dentist
I don't want to talk about it -
Let me ask you, why do you wear black ELLEN CARTER? What are you running from?
Did you?
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
But for how long - what will set you off again? You'll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a white hat - and that will be it - back on the merry go round...
There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea?
Why whats wrong with the sugar -
He saved my life you know - has he told you...
What's this all about?
At home alone - where were you?
I'm good - I was just making a delivery near here, so I thought I would see if you were about...
Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know...
If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.
God, I love being dead.
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
Well. The prom's coming up.
Yeah?
Oh, Ted, DUH.  I smile at everyone since I got my braces off.
I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.
Do it?
Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
Whatever you want.
We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this.
They kept this scrapbook of your life. It meant the world to them.
And the girl I love, she hates "Heaven." If I keep it, she'll never respect me.
Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.
Look Ted. I'm cool with everything. You've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. You've always had an itch for the good life. I'm happy for you. This couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
Look, I loved "Exposed!" and I hate it that you got busted. I know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not THAT BAD.
I don't get the distinction.
I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
You've got enough people kissing your ass.
To the best hiding place in the world.
He cared enough to want you to have it.
A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
It's incredibly simple.
I know.
Even when you infuriate me, I still want to kiss you.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
Wearing them?  Or humping them?
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
I see.
You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.
Trust is something you earn, over time. You don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire.
You promise you'll finish school?
Thanks, Principal Merkin.
A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.
A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
What kind of ideas?
Aw, come on, kid. Throw me a bone. I'm your uncle for gosh sakes.
It's spring break. I don't want to go to a will reading.
Senior class fund-raising gig.  I told 'em they could hose down the Jeep.  Hey, come on.  It's for a good cause.
Thanks.
He used to come around here.  He had a thing going with one of the girls over at the Glades.
Raised her like she was, but no, Walter's my only child.  He was a good boy, till the army took him.
Take your time.
Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean that's how it sounded in my head.  He hurt me...
He was large?
Unless what?
What?  You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter?  Cone on.  She bought the same story we did...
Where's the body?
You don't think Sam could've put it there?
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
He dropped Jimmy off first?
Where's this coming from?
I wanna go home now.
I would hardly say you look like trash.
I miss Dad.
No I didn't.  Check out the Jeep.  It's nice and dirty for you.  But you might want to wait a minute. The Mercedes is leaving.
Say you love me.
I just want my life back...
Yes.
That's right.
It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
No, no.  Look, I probably should have told you a little more, about the part I intended to play.  We'll go through it all again tonight.
Can't.  Got a passenger.
Goodbye, Sandra.
Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
Always hoping.  Or this...
Aha?
My disguise.  And here...
Jim, people talk to foreigners, speak more openly, especially to those as famous as I, Chauncey McNeil Armstrong, English lyric poet.
Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
All right.  How about this?  We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him...
Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it.
That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested.
And if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it.
Hey, I tried the board.
Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
Oh, thank you.
My pleasure.
We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!
Oh, I see, an easy plan!
In the next two minutes?
You?  Dr. Pemberton?  Of course. How novel.
My Lord, he was telling the truth!
Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!
On my way to Denver...
He had a pressing engagement.
"Emperor Miguelito...?"
He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
You managed alright.
I hope you are comfortable here, inside my kingdom...
Me?
My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these...
My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin.
No.  I mean yes.
Too bad you're not more like your father.
Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.
You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.
Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
Are you okay?
I don't know.
Are you a warrior?
What is it?
You don't know anything about ba- bies.
Nursemaid?!
You're crazy.  I think you're in love.
She's a bird, Willow.
No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby.  It looks like a daikini...
I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to find Fin Raziel.
We need your help.  To take this baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin- cess.
A magician *makes* magic.  Any fool can use it.
We need blood.  To nourish the stone.  charge the stone with ener- gy.
Why?
How are we going to get out there?
Without Raziel we'll never find Tir Asleen.  We'd better go.
Yeah.
Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight  street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde  what's-her-name  come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
Just us.
How bad did Mac get you? We figured pretty bad.
They kid a lot.
I would not be too sure.
Only the elders.
How long have I been here?
Something wrong with buttons?
I'm sorry. I'm sure it is.
There was a time when I would have welcomed it.
I was being foolish?
Here. Whenever you want them.
Let's just find Coalmine.  Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens 
I hear you.
Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
Probably.
He's got my number.
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him 
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way.  But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night.
Listen, I don't know what's going on or how you got mixed up with him, but don't you let that self-righteous son of a bitch push you around, okay?
My son is out there!
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
Now, you just help us out today, and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble.
If she?
I don't believe you!
Times being what they were, I accepted the job, -- retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick get-away.  And in that balloon, my dear Dorothy, you and I will return to the land of E Pluribus Unum!
This?
Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
Her -- her name is Emily.
Has it poppies on the wall....
But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.
Did you say something?
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
Oh-oh-
I'm sure he could give you some courage.
Lions and tigers and bears!
Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  Is my nose bleeding?
I'd like to roar 'em down -- But I think I lost my roarer.
Ohhh!
Ohhhh --
Ohh!
Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
My, it's good to be....
Um-hmm.
Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
Do -- do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals?
Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --
Oh -- and I was so happy!  I thought I was on my way home!
It's too late!  There they....
It did?
Who at?
That's right.
Here -- here. Go 'way and let us alone!
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
Quiet!
We do.
I can fairly hear my heart beating!
We'll get you together!
Come on, fellows!
Well, I --
Th.D.?
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
I did kill us. She thinks were dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
Elektra King.
The King pipeline.
Hes going to insert the plutonium.
Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. Hes a man of great integrity.
You havent been given an assignment in this case.
The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra.
How many deaths is he responsible for? How many innocent people? You may only get one shot at a man like Renard. Same circumstances, Id do the same again.
Indeed.
Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.
You knew him well?
Partially, yes.
My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. Hes decisive, vigilant.  And he makes an excellent omelette.
You dont take no for an answer, do you?
Five more turns and your neck will break.
It is my oil!  Mine and my familys!
How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?
No.  The truth!  She thought I was dead -- those blades were meant for you.  What do you know that she would kill you for?
A special job.  A...a...a submarine.
This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out!
And expensive.  Cost three million plus.
Please.
You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.
Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?
Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
Not yet, there's plenty of time.
. . . And just how would you manage that?
You -- you know about me and Dan?
Always.  Ever since the day I died.
Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
Cured, yes.
You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.
I've seen them!  I've seen them in there. 
You'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each other, someone might put two and two together . . .
Oh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No.
. . . What??
Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here.
Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.
Adrian.  Its too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.
With lots of ketchup?
Jon??  You mean he's --
Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.
Ever see one of these before?
No.  I just hastened the inevitable.  He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.
Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.
Good thing you were there to save the day. Come walk with me.
That's too bad. I thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge.
Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
We're not after car thieves here.
My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...
I know, poison needles in my shins. You've got 36 hours. Peace, out.
You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
Come on, Gibbons, you can do better then that.
Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.
I think we should send him whatever he wants.
Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
I have Japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet, if you have the quality of merchandise they're after. And it's a mil two, max.
My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.
It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?
I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?
You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid.
I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it?
You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
Not an option. Just get up slowly like everything's cool. Petra, trust me. You just hung yourself out to dry for me, I'm not gonna let you down.
What's that?
You can't, it's too risky. I'm not much help anyway, remember?
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?
It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
That one I'm real familiar with.
You're joking, right?
I thought that was in detail.
I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been?
Had to do what I had to do.
You wanna see my politics?
I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg.
Come on, Xander. You used to stand for something. What happened to you, man? I thought you'd get it.
For what purpose?
If Magneto is planning to use Logan for some terrible purpose it's our responsibility to do something.
His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
Who?
The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.
And what do you do when you wake up to that?
And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
Herr Falkstein -- you must go at once and present Dr. Frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance.  The estate will provide for your journey.
Poppycock!
Yes, sir.
MMmmm.
I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am.  Oh!  These are my assistants:  Inga and Ayegor.
Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
But I can't just drop everything and leave.  I have responsibilities and obligations.
Why did you do that?
But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?
My father was a sick man.
But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
But, sir...
My grandfather's work was Doo-Doo! Dead is Dead!  There's only one thing I am interested in... and that is the preservation of LIFE!
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
I'm sure we will.
I thought you wanted to.
Wockers with the knockers???
I have a pretty good idea.
He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.
If you like -- just hurry!
Thank you, Master.
Yes, master.  Just don't turn on any radios.
What?
But you did -- I just heard it.
You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
What???
I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?
I'll bet it's a doozy.
Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.
Ja, ja.
Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
'Dilation of his sacral parasympathetic impulses would cause an increase in flow of blood and the erection to approximately nineteen inches of his apparatus genitals.'
I don't understand -- I followed the notes to the letter.
I think so.
No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
And I have mine.
Why certainly.  Don't you, Frau Blucher?
Yes.
Absolutely!  May my mother grow two heads if I'm not telling the truth.
Excuse me, My Lord.  Norris-Newman, of "The Standard", My Lord.
If I've got it right, My Lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand, for I see it all around me, but "why?" is the question my readers will ask. "why?"
Our friend Colonel Dumford will be  should be   at this minute approaching Pulleine. I think we'll eat here. I want to scout that mountain top and be back with an appetite in one hour. .
Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.
I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.
I'm explaining my reasons.
Thank you.
A large party of Zulus have been sighted in the direction of the King's KraaL Getting up, CHELMSFORD moves over to look at the map on his desk.
Well, fed or hungry, Pulleine wants them in position immediately. .
ft could be you flatter yourself CoghilL It's that odd eye.
So far only their scouts. But we have had reports of a small Impi farther north, over there.

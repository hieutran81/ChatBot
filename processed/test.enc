You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
Sure have.
Well, no...
But
Where did he go?  He was just here.
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
What?
He was, like, a total babe
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
Patrick -- is that- a.
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
No, but
Thirty-two.
You know French?
What makes you think he'll do it?
He's pretty!
Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
What?
How'd you do it?
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
We don't chat.
What'd he say?
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
Why?
Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
Kat! Wake up!
Busy
Put your right foot there --
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
Fallacy.
Tell me something true.
Why not?
It's just something I had.  You know
It wasn't like that.
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
My insurance does not cover PMS
No, Daddy.
Which parts?
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
Macbeth, right?
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
In the microwave.
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
He's the devil's child...
Your life, and that of others!
He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
They took everything...
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
What do you see?
Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.
What are you saying?
I have to disagree.
I knew you would.
The ocean is uncrossable?
What did they say about Granada before today?
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
We don't need to know.
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
And what do you think Mendez?
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.
Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.
Oh no!  No!  Shit!
I'm coming with you.
No, he is here.  Shit...
But it's...
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
Are you married?
Divorced.
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
What are you asking me?
They're not gonna send you right back.
Are you alright?
A cop?
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid kid.
Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
I'll come with you.
I'm on duty.
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.
You wanna talk to her alone?
Then do it, asshole.
I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Alright.
Hey, honey.
Stop it.
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
Yeah.
Promise?
Tonight.
Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
And what do you do with the bones?
What?  It doesn't work that way.
I have five-hundred dollars.
Get in the bathroom!
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
Credit?
We started over, you can too.
Yeah?
And you, you'll pay for what you did!
No.  Go ahead.
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
Well, he killed my partner!
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!
He knew all along.
What?
Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.
You go home.  I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.
Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
What's up?
How?
You're kidding.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
It's the last one.
Yes, it is.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.
I am prepared to do that anyway.
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
Yes, Daddy.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
Really?
Fortunately, they did.
This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
How about chargin' the battery?
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
Would you guys...
Where's ganz?
You here to write my life story?
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
They saved your ass, convict.
Not likely, convict.
Where's the money?
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
That was in style a couple years back, man.
Do I get to kiss her too?
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
I got to wait for a call.
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...
You chickenshit punk...
Come on, you can trust me. Please.
Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
We have to save the world.
Good luck..
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!
Is there anything that can stop it?
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?
What's she doing?
Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
Who?
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
Yeah?
The Fifth Element...
When EVIL returns so shall we.
Are you listening to me, you ingrate!
I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
You little sleaze bag!
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
I'm sorry..
You know how to fly this thing?
Solid little jobs, aren't they?
I've had enough good news for today
Three of us will never fit in there!
Learning language.
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life.
At least I won lunch.
...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh?
Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
How's our deal coming along?
Your clothing reeks of it.
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?
You couldn't?
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
Mrs. Christian.
What are you talking about?
Bullshit.
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
And they are?
You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your picture.  You don't mind?
You brought the money?
I'm not so sure about this.
Celebrity Films.
Told him you could get him a snuff film.
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
They're no friends of mine.
Truman Capote.
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
How much?
I don't know, where are yours?
His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
Who is he?
I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil."
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now.
Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?
I'm afraid I don't...
You've found missing persons before.
Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
Hello?
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
No.
You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
No... no... no...
What is this?
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
You're his sister, right?
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
How long have you been awake?
You look great!
Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.
About Freddy?
I'm sorry honey, but...
Honey, we went over this in therapy.
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
I'll tell you later.
Excuse us, dear.
Hey...wake up.
Hi, beautiful.
About him?
There you go.  Love you.
How was the meeting?
Did everyone call everyone?
It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.
I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.
You do good work, Alice.
I've got to write some of this down.
Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?
Next life.  Oh, what's that?
Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.
However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -
Reef!
You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!
I think you're right.
I don't hear anything.  Maybe you've been down here too long.  Why don't you go back up and -
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
Dave - !
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
There's got to be an explanation!
Who with?
Huh?
My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
Why?
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
Who?
You don't believe me?
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
Twombley involved?
I plan to. Soon.
Oh.
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
You can't buy Wade off.
Guaranteed, eh?
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
Yeah.
You might not kill it.
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
I thought I told you to move that truck!
Like you and Gordon?
Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me and Jill had a little argument. Jack, I got to get back, get back to town. Move this thing, will you? See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there, okay?
What blood?
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
But it's not funny now.
No.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
How about a Big Mac?
Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader.
Huh?
I figured you already heard.
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
You mean Twombley?
I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there, with whatzizname?
Yeah.
Said what?
You don't mean that.
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?
I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
What happened?
Going somewhere, Margie?
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
He's asleep. We were up very late.
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
You! By Christ, you -- I know you.  Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!
There was something. It happened up your way.
Well, it was an accident.
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
Get some sleep.
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
A hunting accident is perfect.
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
Fuck off, you stupid asshole.
He didn't leave us.
How you doing, sweetie?
There they are!
Did we warn them off?
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
Got it.
We don't know that.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
How many others killed?
Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
Stand by.
But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
I'll not going without my family.
For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  Not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.
She's a big girl.  She understands.
What?
White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.
Yeah, right.
This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
It's bait.  Don't take it.
We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.
Sir?
What word would you use, Elaine?
Ted!
We've blown the computer!  Elaine!  Set course change!
I mean for Ted.
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.
How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name?
Yeah.
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
No.  I mean your relationship.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?
Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.
Both pilots!
Well...not for another two hours.
I just don't want to go over it any more.
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.
I love you, Elaine.
Headquarters!? What is it?
And a little ice.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'
How ya doing, honey?
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
I'm Randy.
Roger.
Yes?
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...
If I may make a suggestion... We have different weak spots than you do.  Next time, a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm, here, will produce the effect I think you were looking for.
This is mole.  It's good.
So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.
Why?
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
... It's Harcourt.
Mr. Hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager.  The men liked him.  I'm really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes.
You think this is the guy who did it?
Released December one.  He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April.  Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering.  He and his wife have one child, a son.
Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--
Get outta there!
Movement!
Can't lock up...
Talk to me, Hudson.
...that's better.  Pan it around a bit.
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
I'll go.
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
What about you?  What's your interest in this?
That's right.
Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
They're right under the primary heat exchangers.
But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
We're talking thermonuclear explosion.
How do you feel?
Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!
Seventeen meters.
Now many?
Maybe.  Maybe not.
They learned.  They cut the power and avoided the guns.  They must have found another way in, something we missed.
Ellen.
Fuck you.
It's inside the complex.
Sounds like you, Hicks.
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
And how are we today?
What did you say?
Yes, there are, aren't there.
No, it's different, honey.
Did you ever have a baby?
Look, I told you...
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word.
His Grace is very angry with you.
Where?
How was I? Tell me honestly.
What?
No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?
No! I won't have him back.
Where?
No! No! No!
Where?
No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
Tish-I'm tee. What's that?
Tish-I'm-tee.
Yes.
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
Yes!
May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
Half the receipts! Stanzi!
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
Then he didn't send you?
Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
Not at all.
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
Behold!
May I try it?
Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?
I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
Am I not welcome?
She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.
How is your financial situation?
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
Are you playing a trick on me?
Father -
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.
Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker.
Not that I've seen.
I think I've found out about the money, sir.
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
Animals?
What?
Madame.
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
Whom did they choose?
Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.
How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!
Of course not.
I can't say. Really
How fortunate.
I have come to commission work from you.
What work?
Are you neglecting my request?
Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.
This is only a vaudeville.
I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things.
Do you believe in it?
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
Confutatis Maledictis.
Start with the voices. Basses first. Second beat of the first measure - A.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, second beat.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  G-sharp, of course.
Do you have it?
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
What for?
That will do, Herr Mozart!
What are you doing, Herr Director?
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
Mozart -
Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
All Vienna has heard that.
Do you believe it?
You mean that play?
I've seen the manuscript.
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
Ballet? What ballet?
How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?
What happened to them?
It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.
Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
Yes.
What did he say?
Warn him?
Yes.
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
How is that?
Call me Alex.
I thought you were asleep.
'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Not just a patient -- me.
It's nice to see you.
Alex?
Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?
The zoo?
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I...
No what?
Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
All right, you two, move along.
It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
Alex?
Some, everyone does.
Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
Two weeks?
I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
You're not having a good time are you?
Well, I like it here.
Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
Okay.
I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
Go on, ask them.
Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!
Did you hear that?
I don't know. Come on.
Oh shit. What is that?
What's wrong with you? Shut up!
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.
Yes.
What do you think?
The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!
Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
No, thank you, Doctor.
The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think...
Hello, there. What can I get you?
I cannot accept a connection between David Kessler and last night's murders. We will find him, however. I can assure you of that.
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans!
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.
You understand?
Thanks.
I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!
I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
Then what did you want to gamble for? If you'd have beat us out of fifty G's, you'd have been paid, wouldn't you? Well, we want our dough.
Why not?
This won't do. Not during business hours . . .
Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.
Well
No.
What's this?
I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.
No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.
But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
Ho! Ho! Ho!
All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
Happy now?
Mr. Sampson . . .
Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Yes, thank you.
Oh, make that uniform blue.
Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria sailing next week.
That's what he says. I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.
You're lying!
Well, Sampson, what is it?
They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.
I'm afraid so.
What's keeping you?
Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.
Did you say Dude Finlay?
Yes.
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again.
I could use the walk.
It's not a bank.
I'm the better soldier, Jesse.
Which one, right or left?
They gonna rush us?
Where is Jesse James?
You 'um big lawman?
Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk!
It's a secret.
-- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee.
All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me.
"Big and older"?
Gents, we are in the middle of something here.
Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.
That he was.
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
Easterners.
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
Little ones.
Don't turn around.
But I like the presidential suite.
I'm not hanged yet.
Thanks.
I swear.
I hope I'm not being too forward.
Not at all.
Thank you, Miss -- ?
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.
They had to be dealt with!
There's only four of them...
Just perfect.
Parker.
This is him.
Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.
Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.
I demand action.
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
Okay. Yeah. What time?
Pick me up?
You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
Pull out, goddamnit!
Patrick?
So, you're looking great, how have you been?
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
He's good-looking.
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.
You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .
Eggshell with Romalian type.  What do you think?
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?
Listen, what about dinner?
Doesn't he live here?
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
Yes, naturally.
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
Where are you going?
What?
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?
Dorsia.
Oh really? That's great.
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.
Interesting.
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this?
Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.
Patrick? I can't hear you.
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
Welt...it depends, why?
No. I really don't.
Well.
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
Hubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right?
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.
You're at Paul Owen s.
Paul Owen.
Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
The disappearance of Paul Owen.
Pardon me, but are you okay?
Would you rather I not smoke?
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.
He had a yacht?
Don't you know this?
What?
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?" 
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
Yes.
It's cold out, too, isn't it?
I lost my job...
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work?
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
Yes, Owen?
You think so?
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
You are a fanatic.
When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.
If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too.
What!
Teddy was killed last night.
You can't just walk in, either.
I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me.
Look at this.
I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself.
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...
Mr. Barton, do you remember me?
My goodness.
'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?
You're interfaced with our dish.
What?!
That's gotta kill him, right?
Cool!
The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges.
How's it going?
You've been coming in early.
Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.
I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.
Ready for number three?
He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?
Your app kind of blew mine out of the water.
Every entry was authorized.
Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do.  What would Milo want in here, anyway?
You calling Phil and Randy?
You know my name.
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that then? Or now?
It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there.
But why would they --?
Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.
He's out of prison?
But they'd still get the idea, right?
I don't know --
'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are?
I told Teddy about you.
What'd he say?
Oh.
Please don't go.
What?
We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.  You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms.
They're in the neighborhood. They usually hassle Vietnamese grocers.
What d'you mean?
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
What is it?
May I wash you?
That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
I'm going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it.
Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
When do I begin?
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
Thank you, Exposition.
Oh, and Austin...
Be careful.
Right away, Exposition.
Yes?
Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!
But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
Hey, Mick!
Well, you can't always get what you want.
Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device.
Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine.
Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?
Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.
A limousine has just pulled up.
Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
Only sailors use condoms, man.
Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
Out and about, doing odds and sods.
Do you think she's prettier than I?
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
I'll hurry back.
Lay it on me.
Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
That's not mine.
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash;
Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.
What is it now?
Right.
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
Umm, that also has already happened.
Did you ever want to?
I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
There are limits?
Black...
... love ...
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
This isn't a game.
Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes.
We want to help...!
I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.
Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ...
Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.
Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you.
I must say, you look more your old self --
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
Steed ... !
The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...
Orders.
No trouble.
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
Very well. I have a friend who might be of assistance. He's at the Ministry. We'd better be careful.
There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend.
It's called Black Leather.
What is it?
Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
Our chaperon.
You don't believe him?
Peter's brother?  But --
Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?
Who's now vanished.
Makes two of us.
You're not venturing alone, surely.
We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel.
She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
Amnesia?
This man -- did you see him?
Aren't you forgetting about something?
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
Oh, come on, just a little.
Great car.
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
Cole, what the hell are you doing?
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
Cole, we've got to talk.
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
You're going to have a bachelor party?
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
I can't sleep.
Good...
Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
Yeah.
Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
Ilene, Rick promised...
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
What are you...
I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?
Why?
Give him the works.
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
Yes.
I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.
Oops!
I'd love that.
You've been having strange sex...!
I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons?
I think you'll enjoy this table.
My Debbie?
I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
You know Knowlton pretty well?
-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.
Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?
My God, an actual operating 8-track.
In the Field Museum once.
I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
Thanks.
He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.
You're selling dad's boat?
Everybody did.
-- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --
I'll handle it.
You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?
Really? No kidding.
...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.
How's it going?
I could use a date.
Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.
Homey.
Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.
I was doing my job.
Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.
You could check. It'd be in his files.
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
I'm close... but I can't get who it is...
Who's doing this?
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --
I need another one, sir.
Are you still here?
Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn.  You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad?  Or scared.  It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air...
Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes.
I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.
Yeah.
No.
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
Nice boat.
So, you surviving without me?
Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?
I'll be there.
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
Putty? On both doors?
What the hell was it doing in the fire?
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
Sure Ronald? You're ready alright.
-- Burn them.
I'm working on it.
I'm a little busy right now --
Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in --
I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
It's not the drugs, Ariane, it's -- it's someone who wants to kill me.  You gotta believe me!
C'mere. You got some good blow, right?
I forgive you.
Large?
All right, cop. I want my money.
I got them all going for Oakland. With bullshit money. We'll cover the $800.
I don't got it. Not tonight. You can't get blood from a stone.
Keep trying.
...Benedict Arnold...
YEAH!
Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
Meaning?
So that's what you been doing?
Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
I'm starvin' like Marvin.
My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing.
Manray, Sloan says you're too talented to be dancing on the street.
You're now Mantan.
Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix. He is the creator of the highly controversial TV show MANTAN. Let's get right into it.  You have been called by some in the community a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom. Why does your show generate such feelings?
No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?
Word!!!
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.
I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
I gots to go, it's my Moms.
Purely for medicinal purposes.
How long has my father been like this?
How was it?
Sounds risky to me.
I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I should not have imposed them on you.
Please don't go there.
Hi, Mona.
Same thing Giuliani said.
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
Richmond is not all the way down south.
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
I'm doing okay.  Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once.  I thought you said there would be no buffoonery.
Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?
You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
Is it inevitable that the game plays you?
This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.
Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.
You tellin' the truth.
Y'know my lady Lucindy?
No, not that.  How 'bout...
No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
...no, she didn't...
Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.
Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?
I feel a song a comin' on.
People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.
A lot?
No, before my time.
And?
Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.
Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.
It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body.
I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.
Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.
Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time.
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
No one, sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.
Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.
I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
Never.
How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?
Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  Have you lost much?
I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
Papa?
In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?
Bill Styles...
Don't you ever point a gun at me!
Did -- did you --
I asked for a policeman.
There's no need...
You smoke, Ray?
He's lying.
I didn't shoot West --
I apologize --
You shot Childs and Nunez.
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
He said he worked there --
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.
He wouldn't kill anybody...
Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.
You know it's not like that --
Full clip to the body --
His chest was hamburger --
How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
Something funny, Levi?
How do you know?
You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them!
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him --
It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter.
That's horseshit and you know it.
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
You're crazy --
You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.
You and the Colonel go back.
Baseball?
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
Being back here. Gives me the willies.
But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --
I don't think that has anything to do with --
Dunbar.
What Kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.
You couldn't have known --
You wanted to get the truth.
Four --
Really.
Pike, please --
We just want --
No one else heard it?
It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon --
It won't work --
Dunbar's telling the truth.
Who, Levi --
I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --
What happened with Nunez?
This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --
Where's your shirt, Mueller?
Tell him to shut up --
Funny. I swear I saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning.
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.
I have to leave. Tonight.
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.
Really.
You were talking about your wedding.
Karl.
What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
You think I'm up for it?
There's a lot you don't know about me.
Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about some things while I'm here.
I will.
Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
What?
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
You say...
It's unbelievable.
You don't even know me.
Wait! I need those!
So what are you up to now?
I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to...
Mmm, what?
What happened?
How did you get here?
We rented a car.
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
Is he awake?
Did you and Dad have any other property?
Yeah it was okay.
The sets were good.
Do you want to stop?
Say thank you.
What. You're what? You're with this creep now.
Right.
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
What did he say?
So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?
"I saw you waiting there, by the gate."
I understand. I'm so sorry
He wants the money from your bank.
Oh Jesus.
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
I don't understand.
So what are you going to do?
They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.
Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
So you're just going to be vindictive
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
Give me some money.
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
You don't want to talk about it.
We'll pretend it never happened.
I'm sorry.
Please. Why not?
Whatever.
It's not mine.
Lazarus?
You hurt it?
Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.
Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.
This was very sweet of you.
You liked what I brung ya?
And, sir... do you have a size in mind for what you're lookin' for?
You been home yet?
YOU HAD A PLAN! YOU HAD A GODDAMN LIFE! AND SHE JUST FUCKED THE GUTS OUT OF YOU!
You gonna steal my truck?
You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
This thing you got... I've heard people say, you'd fuck a tree if it was handy. I can see that.  But that nigger Tehronne. Thinks he's some player cuz he hustles dope and stolen hubcaps. I mean, I can see a tree. But that piece of shit?
I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...
Think this about money still, ya old fool?
I keep the heat on.
LAZ, I said let...!
YOU SHUT UP!
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
Or what? OR WHAT?
You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
How long... how long I been out?
Where's Ronnie?
I give ya enough chain so's you can get about the house. Get you to the kitchen. You need the bathroom, it'll reach.
In my house, you watch that lip...
No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness.
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
How you feelin' today?
Go'on and sing it, I'll play.
Bojo called. Said you got to see your brother at the long end of a broken bottle.
Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND?
Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
Why don't you go'on and ask her. She need to talk wit somebody with sense. Folks been ruttin' and beatin' on this gal all her days. And this is how I'm handling it.
Y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry.
Gotta get that chain off her, Laz. Somethin' like this gets out, you could land in a heap of trouble.
Then what?
The hell is this shit?
Keep the change on that.
You a preacher?
It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie.  Cuz I love him so much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him... it's like I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else.
Yeah?
I'm a what?
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...
The hell you call me?
What are they doing now?
I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
Why weren't you at the platform?
Know her?
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
Nick...
Nick --
For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.
Nick, you can't do this.
Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.
I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying.
Where's Ich?
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
How big a package we talking about?
One guy do all the damage?
They're blaming it on you.  Christ, Conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner!
How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.
I want a gun.
You're foreigners.
Could you fill me in?
Hey...!  HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!
I have to get to Sugai.
Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us.
The Feds would be onto you in a month.
Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along...
Yeah.  It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian.  Why don't you go home.
What's the problem?
The facts of life.  I'll be blunt. To make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system, at least by men, makers or not, it fatal.  A coding sequence can't be revised once it's established.
What about E.M.S. recombination?
He's not ready yet.
Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
What was he after?
We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.
Look, go home.  Get some rest. Take an aspirin.
She's not with you?
Nexus designated Mary:  incept November 1 2017, domestic conditioning non competitive, trained for day care position.
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
I like you too.
I'm great.  I mean, I know I'm not really great, but I feel just great.  How you like my new suit?
Considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy.
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
What's suck night?
That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.
Lots of places.  The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties.
There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.
I bet I would.
You use your equipment, don't you?
They probably want to find out when they were made.
How come you're not on the job?
I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
How are you doing?
Have you ever known anybody a long time?
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
What?
You know where I been.  I been on vacation.
What's up?
How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?
Discreetly.
What?
Same thing.
Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?
We scared each other pretty good didn't we?
Is that why you're still here?
Hi!
You're kidding!
Your mom was a dancer?
Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?
Bon soir, mademoiselle!
Are you French?
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
You're lost?
Right.
Again.
I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.
Perry?
Oh, I could die...
Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it.
Doing what?
Oh, I'm sure it will!
Because I want to get married.
Everybody's divorced.
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
When do you need her by?
Could we talk about that a little later?
Is this your house?
Yes!
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?
Yes!
In the house?
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
I like her.
Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?
I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
How do I leave here?
This is what money looks like.  It comes like this, in coin, or like this in paper.  Or you can have an "investment."  These are stock "certificates" that we bought in your name.  Of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable.
Like one of Mom's?
The nocturnal flying mammal?
Then why go there?
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
Adult Bookstore.  Why?
You're sure?
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
Yes. That's kind of how it was.
Yeah?
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
I do alright.
Mom?  Eve and I have to go.
Oh, my God!
All back East.
You got a light, honey?
Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be anything you want me to be!
For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got guests!
I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!
No.  They all do.
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
No, Calvin, you're favorite.
What?
Calvin?!
Right here!
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
Not bad for a three and a half year old! I'd like to see the public school system match that! I don't care how terrific it is!
Calvin!
In the generator room again?
Yes, yes it is!
We stay down here.
Well, I am the head of this household--
I want him to at least see the sky!
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.
Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
I think...it...works.
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
What's wrong?
To get some frozen poultry.
Then what?
Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
Doctor Gynde, my whole family's sick. What's going on?
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.
Are you Detective Williams?
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. Here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
Who knows you have these?
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Yes? What is it?
That oughta do it.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
No.
Yes.
Yes.
Do you like me?
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Frank? Can you stand up?
Who is Don?
No. But you're in very big trouble.
It used to make me laugh, but.
Yes.
Does that scare you?
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Who, Dorothy?
Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head.
MOMMY!
Who's this fuck?
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
I don't want to go.
Heineken.
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. Straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet, straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
Do you want the car?
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
Yeah, I know.
Sandy?... Sandy, please.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Yes.
Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching.
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
Still, it must be kinda rough.
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
So, what's next?
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
Look, it can wait till Sunday.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
Did you see her undressed?
That doesn't bother you, does it?
That's what I thought.
You better not, Jeffrey.
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
It's good to see you.
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
It's okay.
My father has a gun at home.
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone, the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
What are watchin' this junk for?
Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away.
Hey, I just...
Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue.
What?
The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?
What the fuck are you doing here? What, huh!? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS! I WANT FUCKIN' ANSWERS!
She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
What? What is it?
You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit.
They got nothing.
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
No ma! No!
Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.
Be careful.
Would someone please come over here and...
me up the...
Aye.
Don't even do it, ya bastard.
Absolutely not.
Nervous?
A bit.
Nine bodies.
That's the guy that got us off the hook with the "Checkov" thing.
Holy shit. You're the first one that's ever got that.
The shooter knew these guys, huh?
How do you figure?
You... oh god, why?
Your what?! Your fuckin' what?!
My, my...
Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little... 
It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.
He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?
After talking to the dancer we know that their mark was the guy in the middle booth. After she watches them whack him, she passes out.  Why the two extra victims?
Who were the victims?
A couple of peons for the mob and...
Well fuck, you guys could do this every day.
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
This is some crazy shit, man!
Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker, Yakavetta's right hand. He's the one who set me up. Then he went around shooting his mouth off, telling everyone I was as good as dead. He goes in there every Wednesday night around 10:00, he jerks off in the same booth to the same titty dancer. Never misses.
Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.
Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.
You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
Yes.
The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.
Continue the joke.
What color hair does he have?
It's got a V-8, Dignan.
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
That sets it off.
Anthony, give me the fucking gun!
There's another stocker, right?
I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.
Yeah.
I keep it for emergencies.
Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts.
She's from Cuba.
This morning.
Where was I?
Well, I didn't do it, did I?
I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
I think we better go home.
Sixteen dollars.
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
I know that. But --
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
What time did he say to be here?
Shit, Dignan.
What the fuck are we doing out here?
OK. Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. He is entering a white van. What time is it?
What's happening? What's going on?
Freeze!
Help me move him.
Who tripped the alarm?
Come on.
There's not enough time.
You think Applejack knew?
Does it float?
I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage.
What do you mean?
Yes, he did.
Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
Why'd you want to help us?
Future Man.
Did you ever steal a car before?
I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
It took six months of research. I did all the wiring myself. Switched AC to DC. Doubled the voltage. Shorted out the generator. The whole school was shut down.
My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
Are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms?
Nice to meet you, Applejack.
What do you mean?
What's he doing here?
I don't know about that.
So who's going to know?
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
I warned you, Dignan.
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!
I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, "I'm going to remember you!"
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
What do you mean get back?
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
Everything OK?
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
Here we go.
I'm working on it.
I might have mentioned it.
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
I'm trying.
And what does that cover?
Ground defense.
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
Well, I left some money in there.
Is that your chiquita?
That's not gonna fly.
Berlin!
In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.
Lots of people...
Show me again...
It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that.
You're a liar.
YOU'RE A LIAR!
Where were you, Jason? In the car.
I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
Where --
You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour.
Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
See that tram coming around the corner?
Why is she trying to kill me?
A Russian?
And you got to him before we could.
I killed him???
What do you mean?
Alright... take it down.
You're sure?
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
If you say so.
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
You mean, did I want a date?
Some women like Dobermans --
What do you think? Is he coming in?
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
Black coat, possibly leather. Dark slacks. Dark t-shirt.  He says they're gonna try and corral the guests on the street over there, and then check them out, but...
We must sue for peace.
Peace?!
So let the council swear publicly.
I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.
Young Robert, we are honored --
The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.
So I did! And what was so important about it?
No, M'lord.
Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation.
I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace.
Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
Wanna stay with me tonight?
Test of manhood.
He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.
I have faced him. Have you?
Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
Your father doesn't like me, does he?
I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.
You understand. Consider, before you laugh and say no. You will never own a throne, though you deserve one. But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule England. And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but with that of a true king?
I am trying.
What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture?
Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...
But you must have something to go on?
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
All the dads are gonna be there.
I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
No.
That's why I wanted you to come here, Evan. Dr. Redfield already has a background in memory loss.
Please, mom. People will talk.
Can you protect me?
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
Shit. I knew you were crazy.
So when I'm out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely.
Just tell me if anything weird happens.
What did you see? What did it look like?
Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you.  He's as handsome as his father.
The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.
Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...
You really think he wanted to kill you?
What the fuck are you doing?
I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?
Not since we were kids.
It was a long time ago.
Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.
I get it. You can drop it now.
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?
That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
That should buy you ten minutes at least.
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
What?
Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!
I thought I was the bad guy!
Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted. You see the way Evan's mom was looking at you?
You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.
Yes?
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
Yes, I'll bet.
No thanks, Carl.
How long can I afford to stay closed?
Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
I'd better be going.
Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?
We've decided, Signor Ferrari. For the present we'll go on looking for two exit visas. Thank you very much.
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?
No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?
Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?
Has it got a wow finish?
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
I don't think I will, Rick.
Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.
I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?
Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --
I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.
Yes.
Oh, he never... well...  he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.
This time they really mean to stop me.
Goodnight.
We are only interested in two visas, Signor.
Yes, I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille, why didn't you leave me there? And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time, why didn't you leave me then?
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I am frightened.
Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
Did he give any reason?
He suggested I ask you.
How do you do?
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
You seem to know all about my destiny.
I understand.
Yes.
Yes. What is it you want?
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
We'll be there.
Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.
Even in Berlin.
For the time being.
You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm, Major.
Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
Ho, diplomatist!
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.
But I have no excuse to close it.
You know, I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne, maybe get her on the rebound, eh?
If you are thinking of warning him, don't put yourself out. He cannot possibly escape.
It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
Manages what?
Okay.
Oh, how do you do?
Oh, no, Rick never --
Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
Put it down as a gesture to love.
Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.
Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know. Louis, I'll make a deal with you. Instead of this petty charge you have against him, you can get something really big, something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years. That would be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?
I have the letters right here.
I have. Sit down over there.
Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist.
What you just did for Laszlo, and that fairy tale that you invented to send Ilsa away with him. I know a little about women, my friend. She went, but she knew you were lying.
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --
I don't want them here overnight.
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
What's that you're playing?
You've had today's water.
Why do they have to die for me?
But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
What are you smiling about?  They'll be back.
I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.
It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.
Jesus.
What did it matter if FedEx was five minutes late one day?  The next day we just start over again.
You know what happened to this?
Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
What brings you out to the sticks?
I had it on the island with me.
Yeah, a long one.
Hey, look at you.
He is a cute thing.
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
I have to go.  I'm on call for overflow down at the Hub.
"We're" not over-reacting.
I'm sorry about the presents.  I got a little carried away.
Chuck, you're breaking my heart.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
There was a coffin?
Come on.  Try.
I love you, Chuck.
And how was your Christmas?
Anything else?
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.
Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really back.  I would have come to Memphis, but --
What a journey you've had.  It seems more than a person should have to bear.
Trying.
Hmmm.  Durango, Colorado; Asheville, North Carolina, then...canceled her account.
I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up.
I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay attention.
That's why you're a gambling man.
Malaysia's tanking.  We're meeting in ten in operations.
Hello.
How about we go somewhere else?
When I first showed up, I thought you'd lost your fucking marbles.
To life.
Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it. Live it.
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
This is *your* life story, Wilbur! You just changed the dates!
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...
And what did she die of, exactly?
It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.
Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.
*What* will be okay?
Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?
No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.
He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.
That's a heavy sedation.
Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don't need!
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.
I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing a car like this.
Really! Is it serious?
What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze.
Yes, for both.
All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.
You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.
It's just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people.
Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.
Uh... sure.
What's that?
I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here.
Where's your manners? Make room for Homer, so's he can enjoy the view.
Don't let us make you nervous or nothin'--we know you gotta job to do.
She took off in the night!
Oh. Well, thanks for the drink.
Uh, right... And that was it. That's when we decided to start our own business. No more shithead bosses.
Sort of like a letter of intent.
Let's just slow down for a second...
Ten percent. Of how much?
Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted.
The Anti-Christ?
Keeping the Fix happy.
So how'd you get caught?
I can see why you liked her.
We were back on.
Guess so.
So what? We hide, right?
Big Al gets whacked mid-egg foo young. The whole thing took about two and a half hours. That's how good he is.
I'm going home
What? I can feel you looking at me.
When?
Yeah... Whatever, Jake.
We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over.
How much?
Come on. Harder.
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
Well he's in town and he sure as shit remembers you. What are we going to do about this Jake? We can't afford to have a Fed onto us.
Something stupid.
Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?
Oh Jesus!
That's not --
Sorry about your wallet, but if you think I'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a maxed out Visa and a bad fake I.D., you're fucking crazy.  Jake.
Says who?
We have work. It pays a lot. Unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up.
Uh... Everything okay?
Lighten up.
Sounds respectable.
We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird.
He was looking out for you.
Did, uh... Did you kill him?
Jesus... Take it easy.
Sorry. I didn't know...
Tick-tock...
Your mess.
Yeah.
It's bad luck.
We're working for the King.
Why?
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into something big?
Pretty much.
Still time.
Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.
The King, huh? Nice going.
He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
Preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. Alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. Bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time I've been looking for Jake, this is only the second time I've even gotten a whiff of him.
To who?
Why did you quit?
Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
Not like Matt, you mean.
Reynolds got a doctor in. They forced me to take a dope test. It was positive. As you knew.
I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
Three years, two months. March '93.
I get it.
Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
You want me drunk?
You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.
Take it back. Till you sell your book.
You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers.
There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
Are you trying to read my palm?
I'm on at nine.
Without hope there's no point to anything.
You're entitled to your opinion.
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
Leave me alone, Marion.
Found a job?
Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you Jacko, you know that
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
So why did you come to my casino?
No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
Absolutely not.
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
What kind of trouble?
I owe a lot of money.
I want you to forget what I said.
How much do you owe?
It's all relative.  I need the money too.
Do you?
Nice car. How much did you pay for it?
I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like.
Nice car.
That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.
Who are these guys?
Hey Jack, join us.
No thanks.
Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet.
You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.
Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.
Where's the magnet?
I make it six.
It's a rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right.
Very impressive.
He's paying out in stacks of 25.
What's he doin'?
All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?
Fail safe in lock. Four minutes to drop, 22 minutes to detonation. This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb #20. Do you read me, bomb?
Do you remember the detonation time?
Hello, bomb, are you with me?
But how do you know you exist?
What I'm getting at is this: the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data. And this data is merely a stream of  electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center.
In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.
That's it.
I have no proof that it was false data.
Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?
Yes.
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
-- remove thrust drive repellant --
I'm getting something here, on this readout...
Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
It didn't work?
Sorry.
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
Or we can work on your face with a pair of pliers for a couple of hours and you tell us where she is.
Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know?  Comin' off hard.
See what you don't know is you're already in the last two minutes of your life.
What the hell are you doing?
Can I say something in my defense?
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
I don't get involved with guns.
I'll make it worth your while.
They took my daughter.
We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
Are we in some kind of trouble?
Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.  But things will be better when we move to a new place.
Mommy, where are you?
No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.
So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?
One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
I won't be staying.
You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
You need to get out more.
He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
How much do you know?
I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.
That's low, but this effects me how exactly?
You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
And you still think you can do something to change that.
You don't want to.
With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
Look, I don't know what you want--
Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.
This is not a place you wanna go.
What about the other kids?  You get anything on them?
They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.
Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you?
I need a favor... I need you to trace a number for me.
That's odd...
If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
A long time.
A fog bank.
Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.
And she bought that?
She's got my word.
We gotta talk.
You blew off your girlfriend last night, even though it was the big one-oh.  I'd be pissed off too if I was her.
I'm a toy to her.
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
Fourteen-thirteen Market.  Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.
What the hell is that?
Well. Obviously no one you have to worry about... Woody.
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
Pick a song, Hawk.
Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all.
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
What's it worth to you?
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence.
I'm starvin' and it's way past lunchtime.
Any luck?
I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
I think we should try sneaking in.
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
Hawk?
They're what?
If he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check?
It was stolen!
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
Yeah, you did!
Like a spear.
When can I squeeze one out?
"The Last Unicorn!" By Samantha Darko.
How can you do that?
Why did you make me flood the school?
How much longer is this gonna last?
Wanna walk me home?
I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
I'm sorry.
That was a compliment.
Will you go with me?
Yeah?
I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.
They suspended me for two days.
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
Is that a cellar door?
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.
So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?
I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
Would you like to talk about this friend?
Don't you watch the news?
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...
And when I clap my hands together twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
God exists because you're horny.
Where are we going, Donald?
I can see him right now!
What's her name?
Because you tell Mom everything.
I got in. I'm going to Harvard.
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
Our son just called me a bitch.
He was a year ahead of us?
I haven't been accepted yet, mother.
Excuse me?
That's enough.
It is a big deal.
Kitty...
Beg pardon?
Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.
Where is she?!
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.
Really, Loretta?
My mom wanted me to have this?
Thank God for bunge cords.
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
Amber...
...Yah -- 1963. Her beauty worked against her when she started as a reporter in Louisville, her hometown. Those were different times.
Mom!
Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on?
So, uh, I -- I'm not really busy Friday. I just said that -- y'know.
I know.
Are we on "Cops" again?
Shut it up, Loretta.
It smells funny. Like gasoline.
Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.
Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know.
So help me, Gladys.
Becky was my only shot at state!
That's enough!
This is -- what?
No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up!
Who to?
Is that all?
I've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -
Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.
Wait a minute.  What kind of an army do you think we oughtta have?
That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
Your Excellency, please don't think me silly, but I'd love to have a picture of you.  I want to hang it in my bedroom.
That's even a greater honor.
You swine!
Then it's war?
How're ya fixed for ammunition?
In choosing you, I feel that I serve my country well.  I heartily endorse everything you stand for.
The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.
Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.
Your Excellency!
Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better.  The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.  I'll go 'way if it means your happiness...
Why -- why -- of course.
My purse has been stolen -- the plans of war are in it.
Your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis.  Without his country's financial aid --
Well no -- not exactly -- but --
I shall report this indignity the my President.  Mrs. Teasdale,  I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war.
Oh yes. You have so many nice things, and so much room.
And here is one of Frederick's mother.
Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
What happened?
Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.
You don't own this man!
You've acquired a taste for this?
Oh, is he a friend of yours?
Good! How is the patient?
Singularly unpleasant chap... uh... I don't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your... patient, Mr. Treves.
Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.
Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?
Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to...
How are you feeling today?
What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
Good day...!
Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there?
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Oh no?
I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.
And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. Oh, of course. Why... why that's very good, I mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right.
I'll have to find some more.
Yyyess.
Hello...
My... name is...
Say "Mmmerrick."
Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.
Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
You look splendid, John.
The children! May I see?
Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
Your mother?
No John, I can't. I can care for you, but I can't cure you.
Yes John?
The workhouse.
No, he's very upset about something.
I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
A dressing bag.
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
Pardon me?
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
It's your fantasy...
How d'you KNOW we're "friends"?
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
You're as bad as my father.
Just give me a hand.
I'll bring it back.
The second note.
Is it night or day, Erik?
Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
Would you like us to sing to you?
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
Er... well... we... we... would be TERRIBLY grateful if you... all... would sing for us.
No, no... It was very... er, nice.
Your Majesty! We come from a world where there IS no music. Where men live and die by the axe and by the sword...
You don't know Halfdan the Black.
Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
What -- rape?
Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!
Louder.
Have you tried to ask the God for anything?
Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night.
What's it all about?
We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
You talking piffle, son?
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
She got me thinking...
Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
So?
Just say something cheerful.
I think we should go...
I AM one, Dad!
Sven!
What's all the panic about?
It can't do you any HARM...
I know. I know.
Relax!
Help!
So did your father...
KILL! KILL!
Well, of course he is!
There! THAT'S a true Berserk.
Thanks, guys.
I remember.
May I help you?
Okay, I guess.
How are you today?
Well, I didn't want to assume.
Really? Because --
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
Okay.
Joel? It's Joel, right?
Yeah, I guess.
You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.
I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
That's scary sounding.
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
So, um --
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
No.
Such a beautiful view.
I'm right here.
I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...
There's this guy!
But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
Happy Birthday.
We did talk about Naomi.
I told her today I need to end it.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
I know.
I think she's great.
I think, before.
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
Listen, did you want to make love?
That's okay. I --
Says you were a bully...
You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my "gratuitous need to shock."
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
I probably got the same thing as you.
I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
It was snowing.
I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
Clementine.
We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about --
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --
Oh, hey, Patrick.
Stan... c'mon...
We haven't checked.
And after that?
What's this?
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
Cole slaw, ice tea?
Alexander Pope?
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.
I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.
Jesus. All right, what's the address.
Yeah?
I can handle it. He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.
Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?
About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.
Every time I tell you that I love you, you flinch. But that's your problem.
What do you think?
Whose fault was that?
But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
I have to go, Julian.
Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...
What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?
That means top-secret, Cooper.
Holy shit...
Okay, listen up. As you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew. Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer --
Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark.
Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.
Solid as a rock.  Hey, Smith...
Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
What...?
I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone.  I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of.  And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide.
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.
It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.
The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
The crew? Could they still be alive?
The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.
Jesus its huge.
Can anybody hear me...
The date.
We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad.
I don't know...
You know.
That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters, 700... we're right on top of it, we're gonna hit!
Do we have enough time for a weld?
Smith, get out of there...
What about the life readings you picked up?
The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: "Bio-readings of indeterminate origin." Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels.
What is it, Starck?
Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can!
We have to do something, oh God...
Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...
I didn't see anything and I don't have to see anything. This ship is fucked.
30 hours to Neptune orbit.
You can't do that.
The reactor's still hot. We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. Nothing serious.
In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
I can handle the ship. I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition. But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits. Who the hell came up with them?
He didn't.
Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
Hey! That's a prototype!
And they're changing into...
You're hot!
This place is deluxe. You got cable?
That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber. It's muscle, tendon. I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some, you know... like, calling?
And if he's not...?
How's the IPO?
Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
I, uh, think I remember the number.
Yes, thanks.
That's good. That's uh... good.
You're happy for me and Victor.
For science.
Of course. Of course.
We've got minutes until it hits, not hours... Victor, that storm's deadly -- the radiation's lethal. We need to abort.
Come on, Ben, come on...
He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
Well, I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here.
U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
I take out the garbage.
I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom.
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
Does Mom know you have company?
Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton.  Perfectly good.
Did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way?
Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi.
Get a ride with somebody.
What? Are you all right?
How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
It's definitely your mama.
Did you get her number?
Did you get her name?
Really?
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
Did you go home and get it?
And... you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive.
So what makes you so sensitive?
Who's that?
My brother is going to kill us. He's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us.
Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning.
What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? You know, Mark Ratner.
Climax together.
What's Doug do in Chicago?
That little prick.
What do you want?
But what are you going to do?
Yeah. I'm registered for this class.
What class?
Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?
Well, you'll find out next year.
Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.
That's a nice shirt.
Is this your first time?
Thanks for coming to get me.
Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
It's John Bonham's birthday.
What about the notes?
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and a night's worth of ice delivered to my room, please?
What's the message? My light is blinking.
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. I think she was crying...
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
Naw! Not a major.
You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!
How long do I have?
Maybe thirty more minutes. As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed. It'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal. Are you ready for that? Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid.
That's what gives me The Fear.
I have to go.
Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.
Where'd you get that knife?
Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.
You cheap honky sonofabitch...
The cops?
Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet Barbra...
They're actually nice people when you get to know them.
Hell, in Malibu alone, these goddamn Satan worshippers kill six or eight people every day. All they want is the blood. They'll take people right off the street if they have to.
What's wrong with you? Hell, somebody has to do it.
Adrenochrome...
Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me. I got your message... what? Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what?  No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while. Yeah. I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out...
Extract of pineal!
How much is the lemon meringue pie?
No! I can't get out! They'll crucify me. I'll have to take the blame!
Could I have that, please?
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
YOU'RE KILLING HIM!
I think I know where a CB is.
Wha?
And that's how I ended up here.
No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
What?
Oh.
Um-hmmm.
What? Really?
He's dead.
In the kitchen, under the sink.
What?
What's going on between you two?
Open?
How many?
What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
Look, the armed surround the unarmed in a circle and we move as a tight group. Those that can shoot, protect the rest to his ride.
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
Shit!
JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!
Let's move.
DON'T!
Get to your cars!
Cody! Cody are you all right? Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming, baby! Don't move! Mommy's coming!
Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go. Oh Jesus... Never, ever, never let you go.
We should stick together out there.
But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
Come on, Frances. Louella Parsons is here. She wants to talk to you, help you out.
Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
Excuse me, sir?
I guess so, sir.
Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously.
I'm not!
Okay, but come here first.
I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
Who?
I know, but --
What does Clifford say?
Does Clifford even know?  You didn't tell him, did you?  I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?
You have no right! You have no fucking right, you bastards! Get the hell out of here --
There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh?
Let's get out of here! I'll lose my job!
Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.
No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
What do I do, Dad?
What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
See you next weekend?
Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway.
Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers! They'll lead you safely down the mountain...
Name?
Only if you were in it. Are you?
Are you really serious? About acting?
I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?
Sure don't talk like you're sixteen.
Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it.
Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
Quietly.
How ya doin', Farmer?
Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get anything.
It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.
Frances...
This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
Thanks, Harry, really, but... I can't explain it. She's my mother. She's just... I can't give up on her that easy.
Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?
Yes you do. If you love me you can wait, right? A month, six months, whatever it takes.
No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will.
That would be okay.
Pretty morning.
...Is that not true?
Did you expect him to look you up?
Fine!
What happened? Who're you?
What?
I'm not!
Your big speech?
You think I got it?
And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that...
Do I go right away or do I have time to take a bath?
Oh! Are you really?
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
Yes. It was very good to see her.
You're telling me you feel guilty.
Frances, I'm warning you...
Symington says...
Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children?
I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.
What?
I have been... afraid. Afraid... they will hate me... because I am so very ugly... and they are so very beautiful
People can be kinder than you think.
More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me?  What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice.  Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?
Friend?
Yes. I want this over and done with.
You will honor your promise to me!
She's beautiful.
Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!
Are you all right?
She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.
Smell the air. Wonderful.
I'll have to do better than that.
You make me weak.
Your decision. For us.
Victor. I love you,
Do you know this man? Is there something between you?
What sort of task?
Are you having me on?
These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought
And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
They just caught the man who did it.
Victor. This has got to stop.  Nobody's seen you in months. You haven't attended a single class.
Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.
Are you sure you'll be all right?
Professor Waldman.
You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
Ah. An explorer.
We are kindred, you and I. Men of ambition. Let me tell you all that I have lost in such pursuits. I pray my story will come to mean for you all that is capricious and evil in man.
So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
Oh, my God...
I don't believe you...
Ha!
It's gonna be a long summer.
Just a walk, for Chrissakes.
I don't love Neddy.
Mmmmmmmph?
Cowboy.
Unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking, what say we drop this?
You don't believe in suicide.
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
Come again?
Where is the little lady?
She's dead?
How'd she die?
I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?
Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?
You too, preacher?
In the Winnebago.
What's this stuff?
My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?
I promise.
Do you believe me?
You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
Watch my back!
That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
I never said help us!
What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy the road map and leave.
What?
What do you mean?
I'm here with you.
My shit is together.
They take you away to San Clemente Island.  Half the guys quit when they come back.  Supposed to be just hell-and-a-half.
-- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution.
Of course, but there's more --
Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?
And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular.
I don't know of any delicate way to say this, lieutenant, so I won't try.  Claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization -- of the same-sex variety.  Specifically, that you were...  "... seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming."
Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...
Sir?  What did he say?
Entering my scan now...
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
Yes?
Did you hear?
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
Can't complain, ma'am.
Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
Did you set me up?  Did you set me up just to see me fail?
You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it.  If I spoke with him.
I'll work on it, ma'am.
I can make this wall without --
Just do it, okay?
Come on, Montgomery...
I oughtta report you.
Gotta situation here.  Where are you?  Stuck in traffic?
You expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare-back?  Is that correct, O'Neil?
Probably hear back from CNN first.
So why're you even considering it? Are you?
Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
So why are you telling me this?
They had to kill 'em?
If not, firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area.  Now how smart is that?
32 feet, six inches!
Maybe half.  Not even.
You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
Should I be afraid?
I think you're the liar.
Do you?
Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be here for 15 minutes.  What's your air situation?  Over.
All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers. Drop everything but weapons and the PRC radio -- we're gonna be high speed, low drag all the way to the link-up site.  Ready?
Subject?
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
I don't...  What, someone on base?  A "mole"?
I'm telling you he's dirt. He's a douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap, puke chunks...
Hey, hey! I'm eating here!
Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
That why you dumped him?
Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
My God. He's going after the nest.
What are you talking about? The east side is always faster.
And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
If the military are listening, they must immediately destroy this building before they can escape.
Who is he?
Did Romeo have a name?
Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
Hey, do you have any glue in your bag?
Can I use some?
Did you talk with Humphries?
And you're beautiful...
Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...
Really? A girlfriend then?
No. Perhaps I work too much.
Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?
Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.
Major, what do you think could have done this?
Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.
General Anderson, the problem was the terrain. If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park...  We should be able to take him down.
Last time you didn't even scratch it!
Do you have any idea what's going on out there? The phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city.
Sounds like a big company.
I need you to trust me.
Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.
Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
Here. 23rd street subway station. Where we first found the fish. With a little luck, this will lead us right to it.
How do I do that?
Just don't.
Okay, Quellek, let's get back to the command deck and-Suddenly we hear a PISTOL BLAST and Quellek's chest turns RED. Alexander and Quellek look down at the blood, horrified.
Not so bad. We'll get you to medical quarters. You're going to be fine.
I won't and nothing you say-
What's the scale?  Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
Go ahead!
You go first! There's no time!
It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
He's a twit!
Settle down, Alex...
Could you possibly try  not to hit  every  single  one!
Shut up.
You think you could do better "Laredo?"
BRANDON!	TIME TO GO!
U.... What do you think?
A hologram...
Never mind, Fred....
Right.
No, I'll kill you. .
Yeah, what is it?
"Assault on Voltareck III."  Episode... 31 I think.
What?
All right, now nobody panic, I've dealt with this guy before and believe me, he's as stupid as he is ugly.
Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
Self control?  That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...
Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?
Gwen...
You're kidding. When for?
That's it, It's go time.
Tommy, look!  Those lights...
But what if Sarris survives?
An interstellar vox.
How can we thank you, Commander. You- You have saved our people.
You what?.. What are you talking about?
But... Inside, I have seen-
What's going on?
Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with-
You'd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness.
Arnold!
What do you think, George, shall I resign?  It's what they want.
There was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at Congress which says I am personally responsible for all our hardships.  And... that I have encouraged the people of America to make me into a God!  Benedict, it says that I have gone mad!
Gates?  He used my battle plan and I humbly submit that without me he'd still be back at Saratoga waiting for the British to attack.  George, why haven't you moved into the Potts' house back at the creek? Much more befitting of a Commander and Chief than your field tent. And... you could entertain.  I think you need to entertain more. Seriously!  Get a few New Jersey whores up here, invite some Congressmen... couldn't hurt.
Colonel, sir, Mrs. Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?
Yes, general?
Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
Captain, I want you to know that I respect your openness.  It would make me happy if you'd join our table for dinner from now on.
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
What are we going to do?
General Greene is here.  There are two other divisions here.
Who's in command out there?
Well, John Adams, your cousin has a marvelous gift.
They are... friends of Congress.
General Lee is detained captain...
We already have black soldiers in our army...
Colonel Reed...
The man is a traitor!
Arnold is indispensable, do you understand?  I need Arnold to help me win this war!
I only meant...
Surely you knew this was coming.
Our beloved father, the King, also refuses to bend.
Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
Don't condescend to me!  We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind...
We can't take them.  Are you all right?
You know very well who it is that I love.
You remember, George, when we were 'studying' the great philosophers?
Except for that, quite like home; England, that is.
Think what the play means, William. Perhaps these words have a place in the real world.
That's good... who?
Yes!
I see...
My daughter, I ask only...
For God sake, get that horrid stuff off your face.  You look like a damned slave!  It's damned humiliating.
You're kidding me, right?
He knew it was a set up. He was ready for it.
You guess? You mean you don't know?
His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
You get life for kidnapping.
And that's for the airport.
I think I pulled my quadriceps.
Your who?
Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
But first I want to know who I'm talking to. Am I talking to you, or am I talking to him?
Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script?
You know how to write one of these?
Only this time, no John Wayne and Dean Martin shooting the bad guys in El Dorado.
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
So, what, this Zimm guy asking for some kinda finders fee, that what we're talking about here?
You say look at you?
Why would I do that?
Sovereign.
He owes me money.
I'm a producer.
That's the idea. I'll think about it.
Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway.
You make movies, huh?
You want to hear this idea? It's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand. Go on, tell her.
You just did.
I said I had an idea, that's all.
I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.
Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.
I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
One of mine?
Wait. How about this?
It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation.
At that point, basically, that has to be it.
It was Fay, wasn't it, told you about the money. She tell you my whole life history, for Christ's sake?
We call you a taxi.
Well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay.
That's right. Three percent.
What're you doing here?
For any movie.
I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
Yeah, well Martin is known for his flipping. He flips over a script, and when the time comes to make a deal, he flips out.
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
Not yet.
Sounds fair.
Depends, who pays?
What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway?
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
I don't know.
All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
I'm going into the movie business.
Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.
Harry -
Lufkin. His... agent.
North Island, please repeat? Over.
Roger, North Island. Please advise pending further information. Over.
What's so great about Sweden?
What other choices have we got?
Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. We gonna let this guy just take it from us? One guy?
A what?
What the hell would a freighter be doing up here? It's way out of the lanes. There's not a port for 800 miles.
I know I know, two ways to do anything --
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
What if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go?
I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
Murphy.
Sorry.
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
Sudden flashes of light.
Candy?
The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try.
She was sailing up north, right?
So what did happen?
Why not call for help?
Who?
Are you sure?
What happened.
What?
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
How's that?
Murphy, goddamit.
How much you figure that's worth, skipper?
Yeah, but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to Sitka.
Maybe Epps's mystery man had something to do with it.
It's a Noaa buoy.
I thought you say Tuesday.
Fifteen, at the most.
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
Did I tell you who I ran into at the bagel place?
Who?
Are you still looking for a job?
I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...
Are you going to yell at me?
But I can't --
I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...
Hmm.
...wow...
Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.
Aren't there a million places like this?
This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
Hi Josh.
Do you want something to drink?
Then why do you hate me so much?
I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...
Since when is she an "actress"?
Why?
Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.
God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him.
Does Oomie really like this show?
What is this?
You call.
You're better at it.
I remember when I first started reading these I thought DWF stood for "dwarf!"
God, I think Josh is too mature for us.
Are you sure?
What should we do? What if he recognizes us?
Ew, look at this...
He was so excited when you bought that record -- you're a saint!... God, these apartments are super expensive...
What about the "striking redhead in the yellow dress"?
Oh yeah...
That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.
There he is...
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
You won't believe it! Guess!
Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers!  Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.
Don't worry.
Do you want to do something tonight?
I can't, it's Seymour's birthday...  Shit! What time is it?  I have to go to the store! I was going to make him a cake...
You're insane.
Hello?
Do you still want to do something tonight?
I can't believe it - he actually scored!
It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!
I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.
Do you want anything?
May I ask what you're doing?
I did too!
There's some good stuff in here... do you like old music?
Sure, I guess.
So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?
Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it...
Yeah, sure, I guess...
What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks?
No you're not! You're a cool guy, Seymour.
I appreciate the offer but you really don't --
Yeah, sure... very funny....
Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No...
But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
I'm not sure I have anything to drink... there might be some --
It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.
If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?
What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?
Hey, can I borrow this?
Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...
What is that?
Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.
I know. It's not like it makes all your problems go away.
Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called before once... it's just somebody trying to humiliate me.
How can you be so sure?
Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...
And you like them?
No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
...What do you mean?
God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you.
I guess I probably used to when I was your age.
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
So where would we go?
I-I-I...
Yeah, well... me neither...
I agree.
Talk to us about it...
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
She's not at home?
No... they said she was here...
I don't know... where is she, then?
Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
It doesn't pay very much, but I should be able to afford my own place in a few months... Do you think that's too soon? I'm really anxious to get my record collection out of storage...
Let me see the sick.
-build the bridge over the Tsavo river. And be finished in four months time. Can you do that?
Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?
Let me explain about time- you've been here three months and already two months behind. And the Germans and the French are gearing up. And I don't care about you and I don't care about the thirty dead- I care about my knighthood and if this railroad finishes on schedule, I'll get my knighthood and I want it.  Professional hunters may be the answer.
I suppose I could answer you. I suppose I could explain that the place is so inviting, what with the smell of blood and flesh, that they have to strike. It's even possible that I tell you I found some fresh paw marks around back which means they're already contemplating feasting here.  But I don't want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that I don't have the least idea what I am doing, that I am nothing but an incompetent, that I am a fool.  Anyone who finds me a fool, please say so now.
Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?
He just gave me his "monster" speech.
Anything special about them?
Just that they fart through their mouths.  Must make kissing something of a gamble.
Finish your tour?
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
John? I know this isn't the time to ask, but-
What did I do?
Got me out of trouble.
We need to talk.
Samuel says you killed a lion.
Has it ever done that before?
Meant to ask you- the railroad car trap. Your idea?  Excellent notion- I used the same device myself once.
What happened to them?
I'll have to.
How many do you think they've killed?
Nonsense.
Soon. 
Oh yes. But it takes time.
Where is it?
And where will you sleep beautifully?
Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
Do you need anything?  You want me to come in?
Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?
Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other.  Think about it.
Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this.
Occasionally
I won't.
What do you think?
You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
Oh, hello, Peter.
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
I don't know what to do anymore.
They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
Maybe I should call Janine.
Is this the spot?
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.
You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?
I'm not sure this is such a good idea?  Do they know you're doing this?
Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.
I know.
You know, I never got to ask you.  Where you from, Johnny?
So you see, everything is in order, is it not?
You pitiful, miserable creatures!  You dare to challenge the power of darkness?  Don't you realize what you are dealing with?  He's Vigo!  You are like the buzzing of flies to him.
Command me, lord.
Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong.  I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?
These boys aren't playing around.
Can I have some of your water?
Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.
Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.
I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?
Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
Hello, Venkman.
I'd like to have a stool specimen
You know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters.  Given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population.
So far so good.
Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  I'm looking for an aerosol love potion I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request.
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
What's that?
What kind of tests?
Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it.  Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here.
Yeah, sorry I missed it.  I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here.  It's really kind of a coat and tie place.
Does it have any favorites?
Now that's one ugly dude.
I don't care what you say.  This could be a major Christmas gift item.
Tell him about the toaster.
To the bathroom, where do you think?
No.  They're just coming to me.
Well, I guess some people have it and some don't.
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
Hey, it's crazy in here.  You're missing a classic party.
Hello.  I'm Peter Venkman.  May I help you?
We're all professionals here, Miss ...
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
You really don't act like a scientist.
That's too bad.
Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
Goodbye.
Who's the stiff?
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
Print is dead.
Oh, that's very - unusual.
Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
You turned off the power!  Look, there was another man here ... You have to find him and bring him back.  A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie.
Wait!  Wait!  Let me ask you something.  If you like shot Superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?
The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
Wait!  Wait!  There's something I forgot to tell you.
It's Peter, Egon.  I've got a problem.
It's working!
Set entry grid.
What happened??!!!?
Look at the structure of the roof cap.  It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies.
Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.
What is it?
My parents left me that house, I was born there.
So do I.
I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something.
Boy, that was a rough one.
No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
Are you a Christian, Ray?
Mmmhmmm.
Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
I should at least have you, don't you think?
How about in the forum.  Right in front of the Senate.
Tribuus... tomorrow.
That's difficult to say, general.
I would say there's nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what 'right' is.
I'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal back across the Danube.
The army is a problem.  They love you.  You have led them from victory to victory in the name of Rome and they love you.  And after all, you're just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty -- who could fault you for that?  Thus have I reached a compromise with the Senate over your fate: instead of executing you, I'm sending you to Rome where you will be tried...
The Senate is out to sink you.  I swear it, Caesar, your generosity is being repaid with public attacks on your honor.  Your enemies want you weak enough so by the first of Janus when you must be confirmed the Senate will be able to deny you.
Ignore that?!  The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
So am I.
Where is my father?
I'll nose around...
God of passages and changes?
I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes.  At the core he's a man who believes in doing what's right.
The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
My loyalties... were in doubt.
Sneaking around with your brother?
You cannot die.
Would that Marcus had lived.
He killed his father and then my family...
Where are they?
You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man, with you as his guide...
A man should be upright, not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir.
It's your job as a Roman officer to disobey such a summons.
Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
I can see that...
I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
Death is a very light thing for you.
At the end of the day I was approached by the Golden Pompeii Olive Oil company.  Small, but profitable.  They asked if you would endorse their oil.  We could get some very nice posters.  Make some very big money...
The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
Pressures on, eh Proximo?  There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window?
Yes.
Do you know what you're going to do?
Aren't you eating?
No.
I think I'd better go home now please.
This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know.
Yes.
I do.
Benjamin -- what's happening?
Elaine --
GET OUT!
Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
Because -- I am.
I don't understand --
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
What did she say?
Why?
Please let me go.
Benjamin -- this is my mother!
What are you looking for?
Don't you have it on?
Are you going home?
I don't understand.
Benjamin?
What?
I don't know.
Yes.
I don't know.
I'll think about it.
Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
Well -- I have to see Carl first.
No.
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
Ben -- I just want to say one word to you -- just one word --
There is a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it?
What's that?
I said -- not exactly -- no.
BENJAMIN?
Come to the railing and I'll hand it up.
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
Did you get a room?
Yes sir?
How are you, Benjamin?
In general.
No. 
What for?
Oh my God.
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
Aren't you?
Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --
Do you want to get it now?
Well -- I don't know.
Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson -- would you like to go to a movie.
Benjamin, is this your first time?
On your first time --
Now -- do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?
All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
Anything. Anything at all.
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
You're not interested in art?
What one.
I walk out.
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
What?
Don't tell Elaine.
Not particularly.
Yes.
Why are you asking me all this?
Well how did it happen?
I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?
Benjamin?
Yes.
I wouldn't know.
Are you?
That I'm a sick and disgusting person.
Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
You wouldn't.
That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
Drive down the block.
In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.
Where is Elaine?
No -- actually I'm not --
No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
Can I talk to you a minute?
Sure.
Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
No.
Well --
She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
What?
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
Ben -- how old are you now?
Thank you.
Sir?
I know.
What?
You have yourself a few flings this summer. I bet you're quite a ladies' man.
Oh yes.
I will.
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
That's quite a statement.
Don't shout at me, Ben.
HUH?
I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here.
I want to speak --
Well?
I've quit.
I'll pay you back.
He must be very nice.
That.
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
Too bad.
Chasing around.
How tired you are!
Am I quite strange to you?
Yes -- I do understand.
I want to be alone.
I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them.
So --
Grusinskaya --
I want to be good to you -- madly good.
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
I'll go -- good-bye.
For Vienna?
Why later?
You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room.
General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
Was the Baron joking, or is it really true that the Baron is -- in financial straits.
For me?
I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
This gentleman can have my room.
Send his bags up to my room.
Oh -- but -- I --
Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night. 
What, Doctor?
You may laugh. Caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you, but to me -- they mean a great deal. You see, I'm ill and all of a sudden I got a fear of missing life. I don't want to miss life -- do you understand?
Her master's voice!  I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.
So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
You don't understand that do you?
Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always.
When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...
Am I!
What...! --
Have you got it now?
Oh, yes.
You are late. I've been waiting for you -- waiting.
You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.
Oh -- ho -- you want legal aid against us? -- The whole thing seems to me to be very simple.
They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --
Evil days -- I've shown you here --  -- my company exports to the Balkans alone, sixty-five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year.
Since, on the eleventh of June of this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger...
It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
Orchids come again, Madam -- no card -- I think perhaps they are from the same young man -- he is at the end of the corridor -- tall -- he walks like a soldier -- Madam must have noticed how often he is in the elevator with us. Last night for instance --
Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
What -- what is it? Last night...
Will Mr. Kringelein kindly register.
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
You're discharged.
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.
It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
Just one moment, sir.
Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through.
Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm...
What do you want with her?
I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
What the fuck are you doin with a son?
You ever hear about the oranges?
Almost forgot. That ten grand of yours. It's in the envelope by the door.
Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.
Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
So here we are!
Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?
One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
Well, make it stop!
You are a valued customer, as you know.
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look a little pale. How soon will you be ready? A week?
See you in a week, Roy. I can call you Roy?
That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?
Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?
You don't put up with that! Nobody has to put up with that!
I tripped over a chair.
Expecting visitors?
I just came back from Phoenix.
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
Myra followed you, huh?
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
For God's sake, Lilly!
I don't?
And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
Roy? It this all we have?
All? It ain't bad.
I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me.
Mama!
And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.
You were right, I had to get out of that hospital. Nothing wrong with me any more.
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.
You must have some very knowledgeable friends.
Wait a minute! When did this happen, that we're partners?
No! Because I --
That's natural.
Ate the gun. Oh.
They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
The killer knocks the knife out of her hand with the wrought-iron poker.
Carter.
Yes.
Carter.
I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
Carter.
I never stop thinking about it, Detective.  The only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times.
A dead body?
I think someone broke into my house.
Checking out your place.
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
To the bathroom.  Can I do that alone or do you want to watch?
Now you're joking, right?
No.
What are you doing here?!
I know.  I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate.  Please let me keep the job... it's the only way I can afford to stay here.
A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
What?
Michael Meyers.
Are you going to leave, too?
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
Whatever happened to women in back?
Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new house.  At least while I'm in college. Remember our deal.
The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
You've been watching too much TV.
There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another storm.  Try to get some sleep.
What makes you think he'll come here again?
You don't know that for sure.  It could have been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
After six years?  Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the --
Come now, Sam.  This is a gathering of old friends.  I know how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth.  After all, you're the only one around here who's still in the dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell you, but you've really given me no other choice.
This is madness, Wynn.
Samhain.
What do you know about Michael?
Miss me, baby?
One thing, anyway--at least Penelope didn't throw out all your crap.  I bet Alice threw out all my crap after I'd been gone a week.
Tell them yourself!
The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.
Can I have the Cadillac?
What'll you do for transportation?
I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
I'm liable to find anything!
You know what gets me?
Leave me alone!  After eight years of horrendously close association, the time has come to part!  I crave solitude and time for reflection-- and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood.  You and I may not meet again for months!
First Nagasaki--now this.
I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
Hi, Penelope.
I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?
Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
Is Penelope in?
The posies are for her?
I wanted to apologize.
You've come to the right man.
For seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me.  We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo Indians, who fed us a strange blue soup.
I'm interested in long-term expectations.
You invited me.
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
Is anybody besides you here now?
What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father, too?
It makes life spicy.
No.
Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise.
"The sting."
We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound.
The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.
You're supposed to get hurt!
Yes, wife, it is.  Come here, boy.  Your father is home.
Why don't you go to bed--son.
That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning.
She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
Penelope!
Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.
Who was it?
That's a cartridge, if I'm not mistaken.  Gunpowder, bullet, cartridge case, and fulminate of mercury percussion cap--all set to go. PAUL I was cleaning it.
Gee whiz, Dad--
Dad--
I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.
How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?
This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.
Turn around?
You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
I have a brain.
We're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  The cook quit yesterday.
People don't use that word any more.
That's what you're supposed to say.
It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.
I don't think so.
I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.
I came for Paul as well.
It's a big and busy funeral home.
More nerve than the doctor, I must admit.  He hasn't been home for two days.  Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?
He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
Sounds quite beautiful.
Like what?
You're begging him to kill you?
That's really what you want.  You become furious when people won't make you dead.
I don't know.  I hope he never hunts.  I hope he never kills another human being.
I'm turning off the alarm.  I'm turning off everything.
I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
She's right, Norbert--go home. WOODLY I haven't said all I have to say.
Give me that Goddamn thing!  Now get out of here, or I might kill you.  Who knows?
Norbert--you come, too.  Let him go, Harold.  Let him go.
Hello, Mother.
...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.
Will you please go?  An emergency!
Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy!
Pacqualinincheewa root.
Would you say that again?
I've never heard of it.
I'm going to have to report you to the Department of Health.
I'm high as a kite.
Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
The new hero is you.
But the new hero will be a man of science and of peace--like me. He'll disarm you, of course.  No more guns, no more guns.
You'd be killing a friend.  Don't you know how much I like you?
Can't do it.
Thank you--for my life.
Somewhere in this city.  Not here, not here.  Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way.  And Paul. Tell him to be a healer, by all means.
What are you going to do?
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
Jesus.
Alice is dead?
I'm only ten years old.
I don't care what she wears.
Something's made you sore.
And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time.  It drives me nuts!
Don't touch me.  Get out of the way.
I worship your father.  That stuffed alligator your mother gave me--the one he shot?  It's the proudest thing in my apartment.
Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday.
He's a ghost!
Not true.
A lot of people don't.
Where will you be?
Is Norbert still here?
Don't know.
Then get him.
If you want to wrestle, you got Lehigh.  If you want to play tennis, you go to Vanderbilt.
I see.
Gentlemen!  Is this right for a fight?  It's been so long.
Is he coming home?
He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
Then I saw this bakery store that was still open, so I bought a birthday cake.
Possibly.
They didn't murder me.
I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
Not true.
That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.
The late Mrs. Harold Ryan.
You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny.  Right?  Right?  You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow.
If he'd just get into scouting, and camp out some, and see how everybody roughhouses around the fire--
Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in Wonderland, plays shuffleboard.
I don't really want... 'body to body contact.'
No. I don't think so.
There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
No, I don't.
Well, actually I wanted to ask about this girl. I have her picture here.
Pull out your cock.
No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do.  I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.
Yeah, yeah...
I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
Overpowering?
Okay, Mr. Van Dorn, I think we could knock that Pavonine blue a bit.
Are you the star of this picture?
Um-hm. Live sound.
No. I saw her with Tod.
At least I'm a growing person.
'Sucking off.'
You don't understand shit.
Is that the way it was with you?
But it's all you do.
Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
She left you right?
I don't blame you, Niki. Really I don't. It's this culture, where everything's based on sex, sold on sex...  ...magazines, music, TV. It's destroying everything. Buy this 'cause of sex, use this 'cause of sex. Kids think it's normal. They think they're supposed to talk dirty, wear scanty clothes...
Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him again. Where does he live?
Listen, Niki. My daughter's been missing five months. I've gone through a lot to find out what's happened to her. I just saw a girl killed. I will not let Tod slip out of my hands. You have to tell me where he is.
So then, Mr. Mast...
If I was you, Mr. Mast, I'd watch my language.
Hey, I'm a private detective, Van Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them.
Yeah.  All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
Where is she?
But this is my apartment.
Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
Yeah, sure.
You sure as hell haven't been any help.
Jake?
Just do what I say. Don't ask.
You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
What will I tell the others? They care about you.
I know. Word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone.
That's not true, Mr...?
Hey, stop, stop. I'll do anything you want. It's okay. I can dig it. You can do anything you want to me.
Where!
I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.
That film was a fake! Everything's phony...
But I...
What exactly do you have in mind?
It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?
Jake.
He asked me. You going with anybody?
You never heard of that?
I'm staking out this beer bottle. Trying to find out if I'll finish it or it'll finish me.
I'm worried about Jake.
I'm off that case. He fired me.
He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
Hey, piss-head, what brings you around?
You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze.
Lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone. Could I see your license, please?
I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.
Took it?
We planted it.
Oh. It looks like a hearse.  Very nice. Compact.
Harrison. Harrison Feed and Grain... At Hamilton and Fourth... I'm in charge of the invoices... And I type up the schedule for the trucking fleet...
Eh, no.
Harold Chasen.
Nice to meet you.
Sort of.
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I'd never handle a car like that.
What is that he's working on?
Well, I really don't drink...
What's that?
Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
I like Glaucus.
And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
Pray? No.  I communicate. 
But they have.
But they'll put me in jail.
Do you think there is any life up there?
We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
- end where I began.
Supper for two.
Oh, Harold. 
... which I hope will make you very happy.
Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
I feel giddy.
How do you do?
No. My uncle.
An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.
Does that worry you?
Why?
I put a lot of effort into these things.
Ah, yes.
What about the draft?
My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
I see. Junkyards. What is the fascination there?
That's very interesting, Harold, and I think very illuminative. There seems to be a definite pattern emerging.  Your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state, your self-destructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction. What do you think? And of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with. Recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution. But tell me, what do you do for <u>fun</u>? What activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the others? What do you find fulfilling? What gives you that certain satisfaction?
Harold?
Huh?
Yes.
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
You think so, sir?
I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.
To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.
Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!
So... You're Kirsty, huh?
Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I...
I... remember.
You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your boyfriend...?
What was it, kid? Smack? Angel dust? Don't tell me acid's back in fashion?
How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck
Here. You'll need one of these.
C'mon -- Rasputin??
Smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator. The statue, however, was hollow --
Reliquary --
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.
They're not speaking. Professor Broom had him grounded.
She's dead.
But not everyone was so lucky.  Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive the night. You're reckless.
Those things never work. Never.
You're kidding --
Helping you -- I just --
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
What are you, a Boy Scout?
No. I never was.
Hey. You: think twice --
Where do you --
Anything else you --
You're going alone?
He's just pushy.
It's freezing, isn't it?
That your daughter?
Julia's my second wife.
The box... you opened it. We came.
Please. Get back into bed.
No.
Come to Daddy.
You're Julia, right?
Wedded bliss?
Help me.
Tell me who you are.
Later.
You're still afraid.
You can't love him.
I said no.
That's probably her now. Or the police.
Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.
Kirsty? It's very late.
I have to see my father.
You look terrible. Have you had an accident?
It's ONE of these.
It smells damp.
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
So what's the argument?
Larry!
How are you doing through there?
I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.
So damn stupid.
Please...
What are you talking about?
Kirsty?
No Dad.
You will keep in touch.
Never better. You sleep well.
Yeah.
I love you, honey.
I have to talk to you.
No you don't.
She's so damn... English.
Oh no.
These THINGS... they want to take me --
I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
Great.  That's the fun of working in a record store.  Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to.  I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.
We'll do it next Monday.
It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
We can take your car.
What are you snickering about?
I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?
I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
Don't be sad, Barry.  You'll find true love someday.
Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it.
I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
What?
I heard you, man.  Don't give me that "what" shit.  You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them.
So?  You even said they're good.
What do you think?  Dick likes it.
That is perverse.  Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde.  What about Television?
Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?
What?
A couple blocks!  About six!
Don't do it, Rob!
"Somebody's Gonna Die" by Blitz. "Bella Lugosi's Dead," Bauhaus. It's got that creepy Halloween feeling.
What are you talking about?
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
What I mean is, I didn't mean you look young.  You don't.  You don't look old either.  You look just as old as you are.  A bit younger maybe, but not a lot.  Not much.  Just right.
OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home.
Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing --
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
Nice friend.
Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
Hey Rob.
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
I always hated this song.
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
I thought I could give you a lift back.
Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
You used to care more about things like Marvin Gaye than you do now. When I first met you, and I made you that tape, you loved it.  You said -- and I quote -- "It was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection."
Rob.  Don't be childish.
You won't like it.
Of course it is.
Never?
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
Will you call me?
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
You know I'm a good person.
Guess who I just saw, right by my store?  Ian.  In Starbuck's.  Neat, huh?
Do you want me to be there?
Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?
I can see why you say that.  Look, I'm sorry.  I really am.  The last thing I wanted was... that's why I left, because... I lost it, and I didn't want to blow my top in there, and... look, the reason I fucked everything up was because I was scared.  I just wanted you to know, that's all.
Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.
No, but...
You did that deliberately.  You knew all along I'd like them.  It was a trick.
Yeah, and he said it's a good way to break out a record.  Especially for what he said, and I quote, "would be a highly anticipated event, locally." He helped me put out a press release.
I don't know.
Very persuasive.
Fair enough.
Yeah.  I just wanted to thank you for that message last night.  It made me feel like... like less of an asshole.
How're you holding up?
No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
That way.
Great.  Super-fantastic.
We're not there yet, Justin.
We saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance fair.
Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral.  The father looked just like Richard.  Even had a mark on his cheek.
Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this somewhere.
Well, the cream of society awaits.  If you're ever in the neighborhood...
Didn't think it was my buddy over there.
That stuff'll put you away if you're not careful.
It's my birthday.
I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
I don't follow you.
Would you remember his name?
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
Basil the II.
I have friends.
He tried to kill me last night.
What will you do now?
You?
The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in.
You want me to front for you.
I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.
You are a very perceptive young woman.
That's why Smith called you MacLeod.
He knows about you.
Come here, Brenna.
Life.  It is the gift and the under- standing of life.
Aren't you getting a little old for this?  You flunked out of law school.
Forgers do it all the time.  They take the birth certificate of some- one who died young and use it to get legit I.D.  Usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump it.
You talked to your supervisor lately?  He's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight.  That on top of the cops bugging him.
It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
You'll not be bringing the church into this.
-Auditorium nostrum-
You're not from these parts.
I haven't much to offer, Mr. Romirez from Spain, but you're welcome to what's here.
I did at that.
Why are you here?
It is always less with my living. Far or near.  But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before.  There is power in this.  And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all.
Impotent cow.
Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
Complete your inspection?
What is your position?
Wait.  I think we understand each other.
Do not turn your back on me.
_Answer_ me.
I'll never forget the look on that Papal commander's face when his "heretic stronghold" turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over Neuvich.
You've been here from the start.
Friend of yours?
Run!
I have waited forever for this. You will not cheapen it, little boy.
It's all we have.
This is Murphy. More slop on the hanging.
Let him have everything he wants.  Now hustle and write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man.  He hides, cowering... Afraid of every light, of every sound... hears footsteps... his heart going like that... And all the time they're closing in... Get the sense of an animal at bay!
Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
Oh, it isn't like that.
Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear.
Just a second, Walter. Here, Bruce, here's the check... And, oh, Bruce, here's your wallet. I got it back.
Mr. Burns --
Oh.
Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
Just for the first year.
Mighty nice little town, Albany. They've got the State Capitol there, you know.
How's business, Bruce?
I sometimes wish I'd taken out insurance -- but, of course, now it doesn't matter. Still, I suppose it would have been the smart thing to do.
All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.
Oh, sure.  Well, thanks for everything.
And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around here...
I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise you.
Ts! Ts! Ts!
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
Oh, this is all right, Bruce. I just wanted to be sure.
You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.
That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns! He's talking like a child.
You're repeating yourself! That's the speech you made the night you proposed.  "-- any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Now, that's a nice thing to say.
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
What do you mean by that?
That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack --
That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
Then what does he want with you?
Allow me.
What now?
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
Never mind that. What's the story?
It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.
Yes. Where is he?
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
I'm finished.
Don't tell me -- was she killed?
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
Nobody?  Morningside three-one-two-four.
Don't open that!
When did you deliver this first?
Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
I mean -- working together. Just like the old days. The things we've been through, Hildy.
Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?
Where'd you wire him?
Sure.
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.
What!
Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level!
How about Bruce's?
Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.
You stay here. I'll find out everything.
Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
Sure, boss.
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?
Who locked the door?
Trouble is, when the Red Menace shows up the Sheriff will still be crying 'Wolf!'
Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around.
Come on, you! Before we slap you down.
How's everything, Gus?
Gus, this --
I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident.
You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
Where'd you get this?
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
He's harmless.
This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
Read it! Insane, he says.  He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!
I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night.
I mean I'm scratching your name off the ticket Tuesday and running Czernecki in your place. It's nothing personal. And, Pete -- it's the only way out. It's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make.
Ah, Fred --  Hello... this is Hartman --
What?
Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
I won't.
And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better.
Certified, eh? Who is it -- your milkman?
Come on with that money!
Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could.
How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?
"Production for use only." Well, maybe that's the answer.
I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.
They were all standing around when he wrote it. It was after they got back from fishing.
Huh?
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
The door was locked.
With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
You wouldn't.
I did see them. I did.
...and four and five...
You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
It's like telling fibs.
What's that?
What kind of war is this Mac?  Up there in Cumberland, we never see an air-raid. The worst problem I have is getting a new typewriter ribbon. When I rode in against the Turks, I knew what it was about.
How's your war, Mac?
No Turks.
When do you think you'll get leave again?
No, Mother! It's War! War!
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.
Am I? Maybe I am.
Yeah, I know where that is, it's right by my house. It's Dr. Satan's tree. I can show ya.
Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
Huh... what cone?
I always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken... smile, say cheese.
The lions were totally covered in this guy's blood... I think they ate his face off, tore open his rib cage, pulled his legs off... it was a wild scene.
Aw, I was going home to my Mamma's house... yeah, I was out doing this thing.
I guess I'll try to back it out on the rim... at least to the main road.
Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
Hey, um...  ...what kind of animal is that?
A dead one.
Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
Why? You gonna do something about it?
Great story Goober, how much?
Keep the change and get yourself a new name.
Yeah, no shit.
I hope you fixed the spare like I asked ya.
Jesus Christ, Jerry.
Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken.
Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
What's he so excited about?
Well, don't even think about playing the good samaritan, there's way too many psychos wandering loose these days.
Should we stop?
Why are we stopping?
Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself.
I hope to Christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things.
Hmmmmmmmmm?
Yeah, yeah, sure. You don't have to get all True Grit all over my ass... I'll give'm to ya... you can knock yourself silly for all I care.
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
How long is that gonna take?
You'll have to forgive Tiny, he can't hear so much.
Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.
These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
When?
Really, now is not the time to make waves.
Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.
I resign.
Scattered, smothered and covered.
I think I'm going fucking crazy.
Yeah, no mercy here.
What'd ya got there?
Open up the trunk.
And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples.
For the show. It's Halloween eve and time for our show.
This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
Fuck, go to the car... call for backup. Tell 'em officer down.
I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different.
It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?
Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
Hello, my little boy.
Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I should not have asked such a stupid question. I know you are a very important man and...
Yeah. Okay. Be home around seven. Bye.  What? I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do?
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
Well, I think...
You think too much. I need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than he thinks... is what I need!
I've moved on.
So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
Oui.
That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous.
I'm going alone. This could be dangerous.
I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
Cause there's this guy. My brother knows him. Might be right up your alley.
Really?
And I think I'm going to.
Oh, Rosie.
And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
I like you so much, with or without hair.  But don't spread that around. Bad for business.
They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
That's not necessarily a bad thing.
You are a therapist, right?
Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
Shaving cream?
Absolutely.
What?
A deer?
Come on.
I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here.
Who is it?
Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!
You are an animal.
Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.
Have you?
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
Ooka.
Oh boy!
Thanks to you, Nate.
Interesting.
Goin' in. We got a sales convention. Gotta be there tomorrow.
That's right, Miss Packard.
To win.
In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?
And the way you're looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you've just beaten? As if you'd just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride?
All I want's the money.
We'll be there.
Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?
Cash.
Bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
So I got talent. So what beat me?
Okay, okay... What do I do now, lie down on the floor and, uh, bow from the ankles? What do I do, go home?
Eddie, you're a born loser.
I told you. I got drunk.
Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.
Thanks for the drink.
You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
You name the place, boss. I'll be there.
Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
I'll beat him the next game.
They're fine.
You want me to tell her for you?
Eddie?...  YOU OWE ME MONEY!
Half.
Boy, we really gave it to her good.
Let's get back on the road. You gotta be at that convention in the morning.
It's quiet.
Give me a drink, will ya?
Hello, Eddie's girl...  I looked all over for you.
HOW MUCH?!
What for? To play Fats again?
When?
Charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please.  I'd show you to the door, but I...
Hey, uh, mister? Hey, okay if I grab a cue?
How much are you ahead?
What?
I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?
Oh, you need a shave. You mustn't go looking like that. There's a razor and shaving cream in the bathroom. Compliments of the house.
Okay. So what's your name today?
I got my things over at the hotel. I'll bring them over later...  Come here.
You were asleep when I left. I didn't want to wake you. Did you go out?
Mm hmm.
I've got something in my bag.
Do you want me to go?
You can read it, if you want to.  You want to go out for a while? To a movie?
I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose.
More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel.
Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
Yes sir, boy, they, heh, they say that old Fats just shoots the eyes right off them balls.
California. Oakland.
Preach! Go down and get me some White Tavern whisky, a glass, and some ice.
I quit, Eddie. I can't beat you. Willie, give him the stakes.  You got yourself a pool player.
...you shoot a great game of pool.
I can't live like you do -- all your machines and -- cold metal and sharp corners --
Yes.
When you're here, in the city, where do you live?
You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that?
Please.
I'll have to go to a new school -- again.
What's that, Dad?
Wow.  There's the town.  And there's the air base.  This is a great hill.
Well, son?  Should we call it a night?  I for one have had a long day.
Are you sure you saw that?  In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
It was so real, Dad.
It's probably the solenoid.  Take it back to Gleason's, they said they'd fix it if we found anything wrong.
Where's your car?
Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.
She said the frog came from around the Copper Ridge.  She must've been behind the hill.
This is where it was -- the tunnel opening.
No one comes here after dark.
Damn.
When?
Oh?
Why, yes.
This could be our last night on Earth. I don't want to die a virgin.
David? How'd you get this number?
David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
You saved a lot of lives.
We're losing them.
Let's retrofit the dish to another satellite.
No. The good news is I found the problem and it's not our equipment. There's some weird signal embedded within the satellite feed.
That signal. It's a countdown.
A countdown to what?
Dad, don't start.
It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell.
This, pops, is every phone book in America.
You try Martin?
Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House.
Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
Nice meeting you.
General Grey, co-ordinate with Atlantic Command. Tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can.
We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir.  If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
Grey, you read me?
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
Well, er... it's slowing down.
You scared the hell out of me.
Your son.
I'm a dancer.
No. Exotic.
I thought you didn't recognize me.
I don't believe it. They make you learn how to fly everything from an Apache to a Harrier and still they turn you down? What else do they want you to learn?
I don't need it.
I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.
You sure?
I couldn't find anything. Everyone is packing up, they're leaving. Word is a space ship is heading this way.
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
Marcus!  I did it!
Dad was onto something here!
Yes. Now we know.
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
Well, Marcus, we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind.
Tapestries?
Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.  Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!
DONOVAN!
Doctor Jones?
Fraulein -- will you permit me?
The Ark of the Covenant.
Are you sure?
I said go around!
What are you going to do?
This one. I think he's in here.
Elsa! Elsa, don't move!
It's important!
It is you Junior!
Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
Found it.
And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
You didn't, did you?  You didn't bring it, did you?
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
No! Don't Shoot!
She ransacked her own room and I fell for it. How did you know she was a Nazi?
Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.
What?
Come on, Dad. Come on!
Brody's this way.
Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that sentiment.
Dad, how can you?
"Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass."
What did you find, Junior?
Uh-huh.
That car belonged to my brother-in- law.
Where's my father?
Who are you?
Interested in local curios?
I'm sure it's nothing. Just rumors.  What was it they claimed was stolen?
No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been --
The plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible.
I had a question, Mr. Prime Minister. I was examining some of the Maharajah's artifacts.
You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones.
You have insulted my son.
Now what about the antidote, Lao.
You don't like him do you?
Two are still missing.
No. They are here -- somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs.
The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.
Was the stone very smooth?  It was probably brought here from a sacred river.
I'll take the extra ticket.  Where's this plane going anyway?
Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now.
Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a better idea.
Just one arm!
Oh really?
That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?
He's afraid of something.
Primitive sexual practices?
You're dying to come into my room, aren't you?
Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner.
There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!
What is it...?
Let's go! Let's get out of here!
You've got to go to sleep now.
So now they believe me.
What're we going to do?!
Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
Me.
You're in my head...
No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play...  What light through yonder window breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head.
What is your name?
Where are we?
What street?
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
No.
Right.
Look! I didn't ask to be in you. Don't blame me for it. You did it.
You've heard of U.S.T.?
What for?
Kill myself.
Yep.
Of course you do!
You're gonna explain.
Oh...Gooood!
JOE Or what?
They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
Which way do I go?
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
Anything...A feeling...a smell..?
What is it?
Send a man there. A secret agent.
What about money?
The beach.
The beach?
How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
Now what?
Now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, I'll be back in a while.
This must be business, there's nothing else here.
Which language?
You got a better idea, you tell me. Other than her, there's no one here I know.
My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton Place.
They're all in it.
Can't tell. Every time I try her, you look away. Or you make noises. Maybe you don't want to know.
This just won't work.
What is it?
It's embarrassing.
What Happened?
No. What do you hope? AL  I hope. I just hope. That someday, you're real small, and you've got no time. And you got no one to help you. And you depend on me. And you know what I'll do?
Osaka?
What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.
Yeah...You've fallen for her.
What?
Not sure at all.
And Dieter?
Then, why'd he lead us here.
Do it.
Are you alright?
Aim just in front of his face.
Do something.
What exactly?
Now, you're too suspicious.
Awwww...
I'll get us out of here.
What brings you here?
I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.
Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
Well...
Oh....Sure.
Take the card.
Now, Joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you?
No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
Who?
Been complaning of hallucinations.
Was quite excited, when he came in...
How's that for fucking Savoir Fair!
The fresh tuna?..
Is someone else here?
...right here too.
You again.
I waited for you.
...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
How often they come here?
Why did you leave?
He didn't.
I'm just on vacation.
How do you know you can trust me?
Hiroshima.
They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
And Dieter.
If Gruner led us away, Who'd he lead us away from?
What?
What?
They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
Don't blame yourself, I didn't have to come along.
I can't. He didn't do anything. Thanks to you.
Why are you on to him?
Mom...what are you doing here?
Ow?...
What does he know?
I'll take some.
Instant rice...?
Just ran into two of your "geologists." Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed up...?
And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?
CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!
I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!
I'm staying right here. Doing my job. Fighting to get my show on the air. You don't like it? Hey, I'll tell you what... fire my ass...
I'm not touching my film...
No, no, we're fine...
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage.
They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them. If he lied, he didn't disclose their information. And the damages are smaller.
Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview.
I can take her.
Don't you have to be at the office?
Who's calling?
"60 Minutes"?
What's wrong?
Jeffrey Wigand...
So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.
Yeah...
Alright.
Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it?
We're there.
Oh, man.
I don't know. How does that get Wigand on the air?
Oh, lots.
Oh, please, Mike...
Mike... in my...
Perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and I see the questions first. Then I decide if I grant the interview.
To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
The new place? New.
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
You believe that?
You believe that?
They do this with impunity!
Lowell, I can't afford --
I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
You mean... since this morning?
Yes. Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?
What?
Alright... the ABC Telemarketing Company?
ABC...?
You fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
What?
He doesn't seem to be listening...
You're saying that Brown & Williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia...
Poor communication skills.
Jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind. Most people consider what they're saying... social skills... Jeffrey just charges right ahead.  Now, I know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with Brown & Williamson, Jeff...
That's why we hire scientists...
Well, I wouldn't say --
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
So she's uh, flourishing?
Objection, your honor!
Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.
So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
I don't need it.
Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
It was a gift from a client.
Asian? No.
It's your move, Miles.
She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.
It was like that scene in The Godfather. Frankie Pentangeli is called to testify against the Family. And he's in court, and he looks into the spectators gallery, and sees his Brother. They brought the brother from Sicily. And Frankie can't say a word. He can't testify. That's what it was like seeing Pat in there. I couldn't even have Ruth cross examine her.
Well. He said to "make the house mine."
Oh boy. If he only knew.
What does your lawyer think?
How do you know?
All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything you THINK you know. I was married to Rex for a long time. I was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together. I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for that?
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
Miles. Miles. Miles.
It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Miles.
No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you --
You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.
I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.
She held that against you?
We're damaged goods.
Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.
I know.
I'm sorry. I'm squishing you. I'll move to the...
Can you Marylin? Can you return the trust? Can you return the hopes? The dreams? Can you just...  SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT?
May I come in?
I don't believe you have "things."
What do you want?
STUFF.  Got a light?
Arty Farty stuff.  Lithographs and pre Castro Cubans. Watches and mileage on private jets. Stuff, Miles. Stuff you get from grateful clients.
Marylin?
It's a no go, Joe.
Marylin!
But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
Income tax evasion?
Rex. Get away from the door.
Of Massey Myerson?
Please. I'm not seeing anyone until this is over. One husband at a time.
Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- this is Miles Massey.
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
My client has ruled that out.
Ha Ha.
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup.
Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
Thank you.
I don't know. I can assume...
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
And she has...?
Wrigley!
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm surprised at you. What is this? Some Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are the most cockamamie things I've ever --
...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
No. I haven't. But I've been out of town.  Hello, Rex. Hello there.
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
Yes, sir?
The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to
Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
I asked you a question. Do you love her?
Know what my next move is? No more cigarettes.
I'll get it annulled.
Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull.
might have been able to help if it weren't for you. I've been watched so closely, I
Naturally.  You're going to become a partner in a big institution. It's one of the largest in the world.
You talk as if
Try. Do me a favor. Try. It's your only chance. And hers, too. Do that for meand maybe we'll be friends  Maybe.  Do we understand each other?
Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that
Here's another wire, sir. This one's from Charleston.  "Checking every northbound train. Also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways. No success yet. Will continue to do everything possible." Signed: Lovington Detective Agency, Charleston.
They're practically all the same, sir. 
Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil?  "My tonsils won't burn As life's corners I . . .
No, thanks. We're not hungry.
Oh, yeah?
What happened?
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. 
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
A dollar sixty! . . . You had four dollars last night! How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you're going?
Now, just a minuteyou can't
This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments. 
You're not really serious about this, are you?
Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
Like what?
Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
Um. You're doing all right.
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. 
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
Well, you were!
Next week "East Lynne."
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
You always want to run everything.
Yes, I noticed he was getting a little fat lately.  Ouch!
First town we hit in the morning, you better wire your father.
Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.
This isn't "piggy-back."
You're crazy.
And he carried you like this, I suppose.
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
knowbut
I don't want it now.
wasbut
Really?
Number two is a wider movementa smile goes with that onelike this.  That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]
Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're brokeand hungryand everything looks black. It's a long movement like this  with a follow through.
I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.
Never!  I'm going in and ask him
Maybe I could jump out of the window.  Do you think they'd see me?
When does the bus leave?
What's the matter?  Where's your husband, young lady
Can I use your telephone? I want to talk to New York.
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance. 
Do you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho?  It's tough enough as it is.
Up yonder. See the lights?
Yes.
Say, listen, you wouldn't know a story if it reached up and kicked you in the pants.  Yeah?  Sure, sure, I got your copy. Why didn't you tell me you were going to write it in Greek? I'd start a new department.
Joe, listen
Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
Listen, manI'll tell you what I'll do. When I come back in the morning, I'll buy it back from you and give you ten dollars profit? What do you say?
Funny couple, ain't they?
Who?
Thenyou'll have to git !
I'd like to sit with myuhwifeif you don't mind. 
Wife?
Yeah. Come oncome on!
If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.
Yeahwouldn't it?
If you don'tEver hear of Bugs Dooley?
When you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.
Well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt.
Gentlemen, I will not hear this.  I value Bill as much as anyone here.  We all need to make room for someone else's ideas, Lou, especially me. Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is and I'm just plain dumb wrong.
Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, Deano.  You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.
What was his voice like?
Recall any names?
I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan.  Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia.  That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it.  As a direct result, the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.  I can't help thinking of that book Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn't want the Peace Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that.  It gets weirder.
Who?
You know you keep saying that.
But why?
Can you get some sworn statements?
I did.
I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want.
How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
I believe the boys got a couple.
Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds.
Black, black - just give it to me.  Shit.  I'm so exhausted.  My neck is killing me.  I've got cancer.  Had it for years.  I been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure.
Then who killed the President?
But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?
But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy.
I'm going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom.
If that's your case, you didn't have a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.
I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.
And Marina?  Does she have a problem getting out?
Please answer the question.
Nonsense.  What next?
May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.
In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, it says you were at Dealey Plaza two hours before the assassination but that...
Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
Get a hold of yourself.
Lou, you were in the Marines.  Who would be running that training?
Graveyard dead.  August this year.  A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died. 
We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
Can we find her?
The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.
The Zapruder film is the proof they didn't count on, Lou.  We gotta get our hands on it.
Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?
No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.
It never did. 
I don't know if I should talk about this.
If you buy what you read in the paper.
Dave Ferrie - you know about him?
Was he there often?
Yeah, he was there, too... sometimes he'd be meeting with Banister with the door shut.  Other times he'd be shooting the bull with Ferrie.  But he was there all right.
Sure.  'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...
Never.  Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go.  I said enough.  I said all I'm going to say. 
Hate mail here.  Fan mail here.  The bad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office.
Less than you would guess.  Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby. There are a good many things involved in that.
But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing.  Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time.  My life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?
I think I'm gonna just get this for today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would you mind ringing this up while I change out of it?
But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk no minutes. Why don't I just ride with you?
Why were you with him?
And you didn't tell the Police?
Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.
What's going on?
Hey, this is my office. There's no smoking.
I'm not a loser.
My pocketbook.
Let me have a word outside with Agent Nicolet for a moment?
Take your time.
Help us do what?
What's her name?
Why does it need to be dark?
Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico. They're hard to find here. I was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat.
Shit.
They wanted you to tell them what you know.
What did they want to know?
Same as you. Ten thousand.
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.
'76?
Really?
Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it.
I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.
I walked right past you.
Catching a movie.
How was it?
And Annette's it for you?
I'm old enough to be her father.
Will Ordell go for that?
The day you got me out of jail?
If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it?
You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
What do you tell Nicolet?
I know.
Thanks, but you have a good time.
I know what it looks like.
You know what we want.
No.
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
I'm sure that was the idea.
What did you say?
She told you that?
Was she there?
Uh-huh.
If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
Where's the bag she gave you?
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
This guy with Melanie, that was Louis Gara?
So what happens now?
Sure.
Killian's.
Better get me another Sam's.  Join me in a Jaeger shot?
He killed a guy who works for him the other day.
You already knew that?
Keep it between us girls?
What's that fucker ever done for us?
I put a little cherry on top. You're right. What the hell he ever do for us?
How you doing, Ms. Jackie?
For what?
The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.
I'magine they asked who you givin' it to, too.
And what was your answer?
I got a problem...
You told them that?
...I make two deliveries. The first one with ten thousand, like a dry run. They watch it. See how it works. Then we do a second delivery, when I bring in the half mill.
I don't know. One of your friends.
But you don't?
I ain't your partner, I'm your manager. I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. That makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent.
Managers get ten percent.
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
Plus the same deal as before.
The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food, and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet?
She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
Susanville.
How long?
Bank robbery.
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word.
See, what did I tell you? Man in New York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want it? It's the gun that nigga on "New York Undercover" uses. Because of that nigga, I can sell it to this nigga for twelve-fifty.
What do I do?
Okay.
Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
Yep.
Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
Well, you the one in motherfuckin' charge.
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
Twice. In the parking lot.
You shot her twice?
Pretty sure.
Louis?
What?
Look, that's the bag she came out with. She never even put her hand in it, and neither did I.
We went to the parking lot.
Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.
What?
You gonna tell me who it was?
Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know each other?
Whatever looks best and starts the soonest.
How can I help you?
You don't say.
I need your name and address.
I got some more business for ya.
Oh, yeah? What did he do?
Somebody already did.
What?
You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out.
You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --
How'd you find me?
Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
And you did that to protect my interest?
She's been there since Thursday night.
That I gotta see.
My money's in that office, right?
Yes.
Give me his home number.
Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.
I'm okay.
What do you want from me?
It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
Things happen? What the fuck are you talking about? They did something to us, Frank. We have to expose this.
There's nothing to expose.
Doctor.  Ph.D.
Come on, Professor. The army's not gonna give you any answers. You'll be buttin' your head against a stone wall.
How do you know?
What can I tell you?
She talk about the boys?
She told you that?  Did she tell you about the $2,000 I'm still paying for the orthodontist? I'll bet she didn't mention that.
God almighty. What did you do to me?
I had to get in there. A deep adjustment. Rest a moment and let it set a bit.
Half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. Mark my words.  Well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you?
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
I haven't seen her in months.
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
I know very little about demons, Ja- cob, fleshy ones anyway. I know them as literary figures, biblical ones ... Dante, Milton ... but Jacob,  this is the 20th Century. We don't see demons now.
Christ, I know how it sounds.
Look, I need to see him. I know where his room is. Just give me a pass. I won't be long. Ten minutes.
I'm not cold.
Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.
They stole it.
What happened to you?
Jezzie, I can't see.
You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?
Yeah, but for what?
And look what I got.
Look at these, will ya? I don't believe it. Jesus, these are fantastic. Look, here's my Dad ... And here's my brother, when we were down in Florida.
Is that the one who died?
Wait. Don't.
You okay?
Show me Della!
It's gone to the top.
Sam, Tony, come in here.
You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil.  What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' "Sarah, close the window," over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?
He did? When?
Who else were you expecting?
It's amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. It's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next.
I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go.
No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you.
What're you ... ? Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Who are you? What are you doing to me?
I'm not upset.
Mid-town mostly.
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
Sit down, Jake.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
WHO ARE YOU?
Next thing I know I'm on Rikers Island. Ever been there?  Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. Four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. They tell me if I'll come to Vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. Well, I'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and I already knew that Nam couldn't be any worse.
Shows how much you knew.
Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.
How do I know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?
I think I'm falling asleep.
Hot. Where do I sign?
No. I'll take the other one.  Right. Well it's good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably.
Total delirium.
Push 'em back.
Call my chiropractor.
Speaking.
Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
Nope.
Me, too. I had no idea. It's like I was coming apart at the seams.
How did it happen?
Watch it punk, I'm armed.
Duck fuckers?
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
Can we blow it with just two?
His mother?
Uh-oh.
Okay that hurt.
Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there.
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
He's dead. They're both dead. You don't understand what is on this ship. This is a being that kills. That's what he does. That's all he does. And he is very good at it.
I need to know what you know about this guy.
Don't just stand there! Shoot him!
What's this?
Delongpre, you don't even know me.
You okay?!
What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
Push off toward us.
They'll make it.
Hurry! She's lost it!
Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
I'm surrounded by idiots.
Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
Kay-Em, you okay?
Kay-Em we made it!
I missed you too.
Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
Where..? Who . . .?  I'm alive. You brought me back.
My boat's neat, dad!
Just a favor for your old man.
Hey. Knock it off. I don't want to have to listen to this while we're out there...
Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. Don't break it.
Right.
Probably out in the back yard.
The kids are in the yahd, playing near the cah. How's that sound?
Michael! Come inside!
Why?
I was acting in the town's best interests...
...height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains. Torso severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining. May I have a drink of water? Right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. Portions of denuded bone remaining.  -- did you notify the coast guard?
No, it was local jurisdiction.
Well, if one man can catch a fish in 50 days, then I guess 50 of these bozos can catch a fish in one day -- beginner's luck.
We ought to let it breathe... Whatever.
Drowning. Lemme ask you something. Is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water, around 10 feet from the beach?
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
He ate a car?
Don't they have lifejackets or something? An extra boat?
We will. There's something I've got to find out.
What's that, a ship?
Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy on his own blood already!
I didn't know her.
And nobody else saw her in the water?
Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.
You from around here?
...So then Denherder and Charlie sat there trying to catch their breath, and figuring out how to explain to Charlie's wife what happened to her freezer full of meat.
Twenty years.
Here's to your husband, the only other rational man on the island. Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone, and he'll be the only one.
Is that a boat?
I've got all these signs here...
I've been to sea since I was 12. I've crewed three Trans-pacs --
Hey, Squirt! You want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast? It ain't good for much but bait.
Over there!
Follow him!
Juno MacGuff called while you were out running. She wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on Saturday.
Cool.
Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.
I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe.
Yeah, well... I still have your underwear.
Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
You're a part time lover and a fulltime friend. The monkey on your back is the latest trend. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Just like our moms and teachers!
Nails? Really?
Hon, did you get expelled?
I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.
A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place?
Wow, dream big!
Shit.  Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
So, Juno. First off, how far along are you?
Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
Sorry. I was just getting something.
Viscera?
Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
I rock a Harmony.
Tell me about it. I used to play in a really tight band back when I lived in Chicago, and one night we opened for the Melvins... do you know who the Melvins are?
When was this, like '96?
I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
Right. I hear they can be kind of a time-suck.
No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
Behold, good sir! The very first photo of your future child.
We definitely want it to have junk.
That suits you.
Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'
I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.
Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.
"Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero!
What?
Yeah, this song's older than me, if you can believe that. I danced to it at my senior prom.
Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
No.
Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then?
The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
I think pregnancy is beautiful.
Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?
Is the baby okay?
Oh my God...
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
Um... Juno, can I -- Can I touch it?
My partner uses these every time we have intercourse. They make his balls smell like pie.
Do you need a large sum of money? Legal counsel?
Who is the kid?
I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
Well, you know where the lavatory is.  You pay for that pee stick when you're done! Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine!
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
Only the one in my pants.
I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
Heavy lifting can only help you at this point.
Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. She doesn't know we're sexually active.
Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!
Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
Well, I wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now. Once we get the baby, God willing, we can create a more decisive palette.
I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
What?
Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
What would be a good time for you?
Are you takin' the pictures?
Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor.
Hold still.
I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
Early, what're you doin'?
Brian.
This the book your writing?
You don't sound too convinced 'bout that?
So tell me... what happened here?
Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.
No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late.
Why?
You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced?
There's more...
Carrie... stop it.
You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you.
Nervous?
I'm sorry, but I just can't see you veggin' out in LA-LA LAND.
How old you?
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
Umm. Altogether?
What do you think?
Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.
To what? Virgins?
You wanna go to Paul's house?
78th.
Three pennies and a ball of lint.
You down with the boost?
The cartoon?
Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.
Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.
Yeah. She's only 13.
I know what you mean.
She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.
How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law.
Holy shit man, your mom's got good titties.
Yo, you got any weed around here?
Casper, where's Telly.
Na.
No I'm serious. Can I suck your tit? Either of you guys. I don't care.
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
Do you care about me?
Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel?
Why is that?
I don't know. I just think that you would love it.
I'm sorry.
You're OK?
Sorry.
Yeah?
Yeah. Have you seen Telly around?
Who, Benny's little sister?
I was like yes! I'm going out with him!
You think so?
Shh.
You want a wip-it?
I don't know, eight or nine.
First times are always wacked. Just be glad you didn't lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car.
Yeah.
I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly?
Casual.
That's crazy!  Why would I draw attention to myself like that?
All you gotta do is look at the map.
No, I need the original note.
He's not talking about himself.
Yes you are.
You still having a problem with this?
I've seen a lot of things in my time on the job, but nothing like this. Yurilivich?
I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.
A few people.
It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.
Don't fuck with us!  Where did you go!
Hello, Peter.
It's you who's running out of time. You're starting to make mistakes now. You're wondering just how much I really know.  Just how close I'm getting? Well, I'm closer than you think, pal -- and I'm gonna nail your ass to the wall!
You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything.  Remember eventually revenge- -
It's me you want.  Not her.
That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley?  "His play is always fair and just."
You still haven't figured it out, have you?   You think that I've put you through an ordeal.  My scars run so much deeper than yours.
You're damn right!  I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!
You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.
I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
You ready?
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
Not much.  I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region -- and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath.
Same as the others?
I see you're still having problems with your openings.
Maybe we should back up a minute and take a look at what we do have.  All the girls that have been killed have been killed at night.  They're all the same type.  All moved into their homes within the last three months -- and all of them found their homes through Homesearchers.
Each of those grids represents almost a square mile.
Did you send the car?
What do you see here?
Bainbridge Books.
Sorry.  I thought it was empty.
Because I love them, but they drive me crazy.  You know how parents are?
Are you with the tournament?
Sounds very violent.
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down.
But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with.
She could be dead now.
In a way.
This isn't a game.
That's true -- but the emotion is still there.  They just learn to control it.
You mean like in the steam room?
That's not fair!
You're projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did.
You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
Have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.
You can turn everything around so easily.  This is not just another game, is it?
They're not delivering.  I'm going to go pick up the pizza.
What?
He's replaying the game I played against him move by move, using these girls as the Chess pieces.  All the girls have been found in their homes except Christie Eastman, who was found in back of a warehouse.  Why?
The other night -- I said some things that maybe I shouldn't have.  I mean, you haven't known me very long and I can see how you thought what you did.
You don't understand.
How did you know it was "carefully"?
Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin.
Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.
We're almost married.
They have Lyssa!
You will go alone.
This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor, as I will be yours.
There is no other way.
You have not slept in two days.
What do you see?
She can't see out. She can't tell us where the Fortress is.
Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
You will tell me her name and we will go together.
He ran a great risk, helping us today. If he opposes his fate, his death will be terribly painful.
The Beast will kill her.
Do not let the waters touch you.
It is today?
Each to his fate.
I feel your pain, but I cannot betray her.
I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
My <u>friend</u>.
The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.
The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.
Where are you going?
Can't I come, too?
A venison pie as big as a house.
Bread is for peasants, and wine makes me sneeze. Got any gumdrops?
I have a cinnamon bar.
You do?
One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
Put me down, you lout!
Food for crows.
Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison.
I am being exploited! Where are you going?
And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
I do not want your power. It is hideous.
I will tell you something you did not know, Turold. Had it been my choice, all those years ago, I would have chosen you for my king. But my parents chose otherwise.
You were attacked in the forest?
Modred! Impossible!
You know the voice.
Yes.
I'll stay behind and keep them busy.
You had a son.
Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?
You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out.
Give me his name, I will mail him.
OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
...Office 2702.
I can't believe it! "Yes I think"... How she kids me! I can't believe it!  And did he pass your threshold or not?
Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
130... 140...
Wow! It's brilliant!
What?
When I say I love you.
Where are you going?
Yeah, I know! But for the moment you're not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need time... And you too. You have to grow up.
No! I don't want to leave you!!
Yes?
Huh, that's good!
Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
No...
This smells good.
She was being symbolic.  What if she asked you to fly to the moon?
What if you don't make it?
I have to finish first.
How long does this... Mania last?
Mine.
I mean why the sudden voluntary visit  -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...
Yes?
Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
Show me.
Your father?
Why there?
Maurice?
That's a reasonable assumption.
I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.
His name is Maurice.  He's dancing around everything else.
Not our problem.
Anyway, Big Billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands.  'Who can play baseball?' And there was a little voice that yelled out, 'Me, I can play.' Everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove.
Lizy, Eliza... Elizabeth Bennett...  Pride and Prejudice.
It has to be a full character's name.
You going on a trip Mr. Parker?
Yes.
I'm walking there Kris.
... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.
You look so happy -- how long have you been married?
What do you think I should get?
...Noooo.
No.
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
We should pick up a bottle of tequila on the way. I owe you one.
Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.
How long have I been here?
What do you mean?
That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
You can never... never... ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?
Hi!
Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
Sera... I hope that you understand how I feel about this. First of all, you're welcome to my money. We can buy a couple of cases of liquor and you can have the rest. But I don't think you're talking to me right now about money.
Oh, and what did you do?
So... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?
I'm pleased with you, Sera... how you have moved up in the world. I showed you a glamorous world when I took you off the streets...  and how you repay me.
He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
He's an ass that's gonna try.
Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
I think it's time discuss your career path. Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?
I do. I'm not allowing it.
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:03.
No!
So, what's this Sarah got that you don't? Three tits?
Good one.
Name?
Oh, how sweet! You made friends with a nerdy girl.
Did she do that to you, too?
Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
Did you see the icky black color of her hair?
So?
I can't.
Well, you should -- If you look good, you feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world.
He's gay! Enrique is gay!
Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.
Someone missed you.
Well, hurry up so you can come home! We miss you!
I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks!
I completely agree.
Elle, believe me, I never expected to be doing this, but I think it's the right thing to do.
I told you, Elle. I need someone -- serious.
So -- uh -- how was your first class?
Now I am.
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
Is it a Kappa?
Why?!
There he is!
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
Your love.
You are cruel!  Your heartless jesting worse than torture!  How can you speak of love when you see what I am!
Like some vile toadstool.
I can keep a victim alive for weeks... months, if I desire it... it's an art.  They beg for death... I keep it just out of their reach.  The pain remains constant.
I see...
What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.
I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --
Friend Ogg.  Excuse our enthusiasm, occasioned as it was by a fondness for you.
Faerie ring?
And how is it a mortal dare dictate to the faerie folk?  Is me music not to your liking?  Mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure.
It's bluebells!
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
Then, what's gone wrong?  Why did it happen?
Here now.  Toss her this when you've the chance.  Jenny Greenteeth can't resist the sight of herself in a glass.  She's terribly vain.  Praise her beauty and you'll lull her sweet as a babe in a cradle.
Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
There's the spirit, lad.  If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up.
What is it?
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
Fine-looking army.
Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
Make haste!  We've a hard day's march ahead.
What make ye of that, Jack?
We'll never find the Baron's castle.
Don't loose heart... Assemble the archers.  Have everyone not holding a shield man a bow.  Shoot the damned things as they fly.
Been telling you that all along, lad.
That's it!  The unbreakable line! We'll tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis... then, I'll climb up and chop down the drawbridge.
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
Aye.  We're good as inside.
Nay.  You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine.
Sunlight, you say?
Hey!  Stop it!  I can't see.
Seems to be some sort of vaulted chamber up ahead...
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst!
The quest's at an end and where's the good of it?  A faerie festival over a pile of bones?
How're these?
These for me?
The Baron is a frightful man.  They say he's an ogre.  He wears a mask so none may see his face.
Oh, fie.  What about the unicorn?
What shall we do?
The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
How bad was the unicorn's wound?
If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  Do you wish to marry me, Jack?
I'm afraid it may storm.
Tis not fit for a princess.
If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
No!  I won't let it happen...
Sunlight... It destroys him.
Oh no, dearest Jack... I meant every word.
Pinching?  Where?
Step lively now!
Here be the death weapon; the unicorn's blood dry upon it.
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
No!
You'll visit again?
Courage, Jack.
Were I a mortal girl, Jack, methinks I'd be in love with you.
Such a sad world, be there no unicorns to brighten it.
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
In every way.
Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.
Is this a May Day pageant?  Are you all off on a lark...?  The raven passed this way hours ago!
What do we do now?
Master Jack!  Master Jack!  These woods are alive!  They're alive!
Sorry, Jack.
I put him to work.
I couldn't get it to go down.
I couldn't sleep last night.
Why?
I'm living here while I build another house.
I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?
You have to ask like that?
They're trying to make me spend the summer here.  I'm leaving in the morning.
Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
I might not stay, anyway.
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
I've seen lots of people.  It's not a big thing for me.
What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality.  I mean, I hope I'm not the first to say that about you.
Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?
He won't leave my room.
It could have been a squirt gun.
We've known each other since grade school.
Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop.
An exhaust system or a window is code.
Maybe...?
Forty.
Class of eighty-six!  I didn't know you were there.
I hate this job.
I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
Come over anytime you need to, Sam.
It's midnight.  What's the matter, Sam?
Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?
There are no windows facing my...exposure.
The whole summer, man.  Party in Tahoe.
I never said anything.  I haven't done anything.
I'm not going!
I'm not going!
Your nose ring comes out of your nose. If you've got them in your nipples, they come out, too.  And there's no make-up at my house.  No glue sniffing.  Huffing. No pills, no grass.
If you hit me, I'll call the police.
Are you totally insane?!
I don't know.
You can't make me do a thing.
Sit down for a second.
Do whatever you want with it.  I don't care.  All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
I know the feeling.
What I'm not.
Nothing.
I aimed high.
Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot.  I didn't write him up...told him I wouldn't tell you...
A blueprint spool.
Four days.  I left to think.
Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
One of you would end up dead.
No.  I was going to let you do that.
I did say he could go.
We're fine.  Turkey sandwiches.
What?
I used to live here.
Finished or unfinished?
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
I thought you'd be up with the sun.
I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
Do you need help?
Going on?
That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that?
I didn't think you'd come today.
No goodbye.  No fuck you.  No 'Are you in love with George?'
It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes.
We've eaten.
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
You never really trusted me.
Where are the kids?
Thanks for talking about me behind my back...useful in court.
I've missed you guys.
The door was open.
A night in the hole?
Don't take it so hard, Biscuit. She don't mean nothin' to him.
Oh, no, Ray. Not tonight. Spanky's not happy with you.
Is Spanky here?
My name's Yvette. Sylvia sent me. You look just like she said.
Why not?
Married?
Damn dentures slipping again. Everything falls apart when you grow old, eh, Claude? Time sure marches on.
You know I trust you, Claude.
Cool it, Ray. You're gonna get us in a lot of trouble.
Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
Claude Banks.
Where they taking us, anyway?
Come on, daddy-o. You haven't said a word since we started. Least you could do is make some friendly conversation.
Well, if you must know, bank teller at First Federal of Manhattan. I'm responsible for keeping track of hundreds, occasionally thousands of dollars.
Hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. Just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. Get you every time.
I didn't start out to be a bank teller. I was gonna be a ballplayer. Even had an offer to play short for the Newark Eagles.
At some point a man's got to get serious about his future. I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking about.
A loan officer?
So you mean, if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, I'd have to hype some square like you?
Like this?
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
What gave you that idea?
That was mighty charitable of you, Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight.
I think he's hurt pretty bad.
What do you think you're doing?! The man's been dead for two seconds! Don't you have any respect?
Winston. His name's Winston.
Would you look at that, Ray. Winston up and died on us.
I kinda lost track of how many people we killed that night. Must have been 15 or twenty -- not counting women and children. It was a real bloodbath. All that screaming...
No, man. I want you to have it.
Maynard Banks, Esquire. Attorney at law.
On your behalf. What happened to we?
You call this a map? What was Cookie smoking when he drew this?
Don't mention it.
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
Judge must have money riding on the championship.
I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
No, I'm gonna kill him --
That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats.
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
That's right, fellas. Catch any cab heading uptown. All the drivers know Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall.
Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
Hey, Ray, you ever been to the Cotton Club?
They'll be sending you up there soon enough. And not just for a visit, neither.
Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick.
I knew it. He's finally retiring.
Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?
It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?
I'll call her later.
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
Where is he? He's late.
So far, so good. Now what?
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
But those are my roommate's sodas...
This is baloney!
C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.
I got no ears! I can't hear!
I mean... tough break.
I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
Coulda been much worse.
That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock.
Look who's back from the dead.
Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
Hello.
You smell like coconuts.
Valerie Doran? Two floors up, one window over.
Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
It's freezing my hands.
Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?
What were you thinking coming here?
..."The Devil?"...
Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
That just hurt a lot.
Do you have anything special in mind?
What the hell took you so long?
Anybody we know?
What's going on, Logan?!
...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
I'm very smart.
Please... no?  You mean "not here" -- that's it? You're a private Available but particular.  Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you.
No.
And?
I changed my mind.
Six. I go red next year.
I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
I'm going to run.
You know something.
And then you killed him, right?
Are you here to help me?
Of course --
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.
I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.
That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
Because he's my friend --  and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
They won't believe us.
I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
Look at his face... and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old?
Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
Things change!
Yes, cats, of course. What else could they be? Cats. Of course each one has his own name too.
But there are so many of them. Do you know each one separately.
Yes...
We'll have to bury him.
I have always been here...
No, no, no
May we stay here for a while? We'd like to rest.
Is that really it? It doesn't seem very far. Will we be there soon?
My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together.
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
No -- just there -- on the first level.  Don't look for us. We'll see you.
What's happenin'?
What do you mean by that?
What is?
As best we can.
Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to.
I don't know.
Have you partied with him?
What deal?
Yeah.
In pornos?
What about tonight?... Whatiya gonna do about Mr. Eddy tonight?
I'm not goin' home tonight... I'm goin' somewhere else...  To a girlfriend's house.  But, we still have a coupla things to take care of...
Where's the bathroom?
Yes, I believe so.
I don't. I don't know him.
Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
Sheila?
We're not saying anything about that night to the police. We should all forget that night.
Please tell me.
His condition? What do you mean?
I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
You just gonna let him go?
Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
Who is this man?
There's no other bedroom?
What's your axe?
Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
Something wrong?
The doctor said not to give you anything. You can see him in the morning.
We've met before, haven't we?
Where would you feel safe?
Let's go home.
I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
No. No, I don't.
Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
You still care about me?
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
Where'd you come from?
Sheila... Stop...
A what?
It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
Okay, brother.
Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? Say, we're supposed to be traveling east, aren't we?
Well, it looks to me as if we're traveling west.
Yes!
Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
Have I?
Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
The police?
Yes.
Okay, Lovey.
And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here. Why, we don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed!
Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?
It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?
Hey, what's happened to you?
Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!
And mine's Conway.
That's intelligent.
You have no disputes over women?
That would suit me perfectly. I'm always broke. How did you pay for them?
Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . .
108 and still active?
Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.
Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This thing or that killed him?"
The only one.
No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
Yes.
Oh, yes. There is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside world. Every now and again, depending upon favorable weather of course, they make the journey.
The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come.
Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
What is it, my son?
Bob! I think I hear motors!
And be sure that none of the natives get in.
Bob, these are all that are left.
George, what are you going to do?
What is it? Has he fainted?
See that spot?
It's far from over, from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned at all.
Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners.
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
You can't leave, George.
Is that all my story meant to you?
Please, George. I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Yes, the little Russian girl.
What do you mean - "fade away like an echo"?
was saying
Bob, can't you get them to wait for us? They're leaving us farther behind every day.
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here.
I'm so glad.
Why?
You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.
It would serve you right if you were left behind.
Couldn't you arrange to make a little less noise?
You'll wait till you rot!
The hell were you thinking?
I guess I lost:
And Goodwill Toward Man?
Well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly...
Sir.  I thought those records were sealed.
Only the damn guy won't know it.
Further... what are you talking about, air?  That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records--
Well this didn't.
You do?
Underground gas vein.  Next time, be more careful when you shoot off your guns.
I know, but we're on a college campus...
Just so I understand... you're "thing" is... acting like an idiot?  Or is it actually being an idiot?  Besides--
I know, I know.  I read the manual. No attachments.  We work alone. Blah. blah.
Why?  Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  I know I don't know you all that well, but--
Kay, um... how, uh, fast does this thing actually go ... ?
Now what?
Gee.  You really think?
I dunno. Why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner?.
Kay--
What are you doing?
Since how long?
Not her. Me.    They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful.
Sure.
So, I guess you could say you're really into insects...
Right, right-- I like that stuff.
I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
No.
The kid looked desperate.  I figured...
Your licence is revoked. Permanently.
Try seven.  From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident.  You wanna tell me what's going on?  Huh?
... recent landings within a hundred mile radius of Sudbury, Virginia?
Yeah, Kay?
Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals--
What if I don't?
Which way?
Even that little bug you found in Sudbury seems to have taken off.
Is it now?
They're inside.
Take it.
Drop some money.
She died?
Anesthesia.  Try to relax, John.  I'm saying I'll have to remove your eyes.  Completely.
It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
Kill type?
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
John.  Please.  Listen to me --
John --
What he's doing now, we call "scrubbing the image", looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen.
Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
Okay, Jad, what's coming?
Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
What?
Red Ball?
Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
Really?  You've never been inside?
So I'll be the first one to go in then?
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
What does he think of your chosen line of work?
At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.
Are these all of her previsions?
Detective.  Nice of you to come down here.  Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now.  Jesus, what's up with your eye?
Rufus.  She's a precog.
You gotta have faith, Dad.
Something wrong?
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
You say some of the children died?
You're saying that I've halo'd innocent people?
Insignificant to you maybe, but what about those people I put away with alternate futures?  My God, if the country knew there was a chance they might not --
I'm not gonna kill anybody.
You said they're destroyed.
What safe place is that?
Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
This is all my fault.
But I also know why he married you: you're as stubborn as he is.
The guy from USA Today is here.
Oh, it's all my damn business now, Lamar.  Investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy.  He's my suspect.
Now the second image.  Watch the water.  The wind's changed.  The ripples are going the other way.
This is Evanna, the team pilot.
There's thousands of units like this one.
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
What kind of cop were you before this?
My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
I like it.
Thanks.  You take anything in your coffee?
But John was with him at the pool?
You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
They were grabbing her fucking ass --
As far as...?
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks --
You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing.
Ricky's not wearing one.
I don't know.
Can you take me to Color Me Mine?
Honey?
So, what kind of gig is this?
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.
Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
Yeah? You sure?
Shhh. He'll hear you.
I'll support you.
I never promised you anything.
Goodbye, Bobby.
Get your hands off of her.
5-5-1.
What's his name?
So, when's the drop.
It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing.
This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
So what do we do?
Now, here's what worries me. He said he wants to meet up at a bar in Red Hook. You know where that is?
Quick drop. In and out.
Where's Ricky?
She was fast, huh?
You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.
A bad heart.
So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?
You don't know where you're going?
This Ruiz guy, what's his deal?
I wouldn't keep bugging you, but you said he said he would have a job for us.
I'm not gonna bring it up to him.
Ask if he said anything to her.
I will.
I thought you hate that club.
You wanna go right now?
Fuck him.
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
How much is it?
What are you doing?
How'd they know who you were?
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop.
Where do you think you're going?
Look who's back? Want some champagne?
Put that shit out...
I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
The what?
The penguin house.
What about it?
I'm sorry...
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
No. I'll wait here.
I don't wear a white wig, I don't carry a gavel.
You want your surprise?
Yeah. I want it.
Watch out, man. Sorry. I'm on the list, man.  Hey, bro.
You look big, man. Diesel. You been lifting?
A little.
You look good, man.
Yeah, sure. How much are they?
Yes.  Would you care for another one?
Yes.
Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
Why? What I say bad?
See you later.
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
Come, now. You just got here.
I can't yet vouch for the amount, unless you want me to sit here and count.
Yeah.
Nah, man...
Last thing I want is you with a gun.
Ricky.
So you're our own private guy?
I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?
Tell me.
Yeah.
And where might that be?
What they call you?
Heard where?
Man's rep travels.
No, my mama. She's from Grenada.
Why?
When?
What?
Okay, baby. Now you outfitted. You ready to tackle the street?
It hit?
I'm wearing, Archie.
Man, what do you want?
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
Sure, burn yourself, pain yourself, put all that poison into your hair, into your body -- trying to be white.
Man, I'm studying in the man's book. I don't dig half the words.
I sure met some.
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob somebody's house.
Folks are sitting out there today, not next week, expecting to hear our program.
There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.
What have you set your mind to?
Yes. Did you eat?
Hush your mouth.
The talk is everywhere!
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face the truth? Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. Ask him why your name hasn't been in "Muhammad Speaks" in over a year? Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own.
I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
Get some sleep.
Brother Minister, what is wrong?
Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate?
If you want to tell me.
Are you Elijah's pimp?
Is she hooking?
These are my children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None.
I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
Did you hear me?!
How many you turning out?
All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love y'all.
I'm with you, Brother Minister.
That's alright. Baby, take your time. Sophia's not going anywhere. I told you to walk, don't run.
You evil this morning.
Me?
You will, baby -- if the time come.
Fine as May wine.
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
What did you do, Homey, palm it?
You want to be the head man?
Watch your tongue, boy.
Brother Minister he often talked about you. He loves you, loves you like his own son. Says you are the best, his greatest Minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him.
This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.
This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him like a brother.
Good grades. Fine athlete. President of his class.
It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
[Where are you coming from?]
[Where are you staying in Mexico?]
[What's the PIN number?]
[Who's Tazinari?]
[The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."]
[Drive.]
[I don't know. We were just given instructions to take her.]
[I believe you.]
[How do I recognize him.]
[The girl's. Pinta's.]
And what if amateurs try it?
I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?
Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
So what's wrong?
How long you staying, Crease?
Your Spanish is good enough. You certainly look the part.
Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
I came to visit you.
There's still ink on my fingers from last week.
I've heard of it. Never happened to me though. Maybe the firing pin's off.
Who's Emilio?
In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr. Creasy?
The United States.
Why not?
Hmmm?
What are you doing?
Maybe. Did you hear him?
The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't you?
Well, it's a sort of wife.
I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
I'm tough, Creasy. I'm tough as you.
You think too much?
I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.
Continue to play in the wrong key, like you're dyslexic.
Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has a complete block about 'C' Minor. But remember, "Whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves." New Testament, Romans 13.
How are you getting along with Pinta?
It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.
They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.
Last night. Do you know something?
Her beauty fucks with your mind.
[I need a driver to drive Samuel, the father.]
You should be sleeping, baby.
Could he speak English? Emilio couldn't speak English.
You do?
I think it's fantastic.
[Then what do you have to lose?]
I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing.
That's what friends do.
She probably got a date by now, Angie.
Well, we're back to that, huh? I say to you, "What do you feel like doing tonight?" And you say to me, "I don't know, what do you feel like doing?" And then we wind up sitting around your house with a coupla cansa beer, watching Sid Caesar on television. Well, I tell you what I feel like doing. I feel like calling up this Mary Feeney. She likes you.
Yeah, she looks all right from here.
I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
Boy, you really musta made out good last night.
Marty, your mother wants you onna phone.
Who told you that?
I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I have a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much I can't sleep. It's a curse to be old. How you feel?
You know the old man upstairs in this house. Old Irishman, always drunk. He got pleurisy. He was inna hospital two weeks. He died yesterday.
Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
What happen?
Ufa!
My son Thomas came to see you this afternoon, and he said to you he wants to cast his mother from his house?
Hey, I come home from your house last night, Marty was here with a girl.
I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
Wadda you think?
No, Marty, please...
No...
So I'll call you tomorrow.
No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.
It was very nice meeting you, Mrs. Pilletti. I hope I'll see you again.
I'm stag.
Are you kidding?
Sure, what?
Tommy, gimme a coupla minutes, because I promised Mr. Gazzara I'd let him know tomorrow. See, what I wanna know, Tom, if a buncha individual retail merchants get together, how does it operate? On individual mark- ups? You know what I mean? Say I'm the butcher and Aldo Capelli, he's the dairyman and grocer, so suppose I mark up thirty-five percent, but he works on forty, so...
Marty...
Oh, it's a sad business.  My sister, Catherine, she don't get along with her daughter-in-law, so she's gonna come live with us.
I heard you, Ma.
What, Ma?
What didn't you like about her?
...I been talking about two nurses Leo and me picked up in a bar on Seventy-First Street.
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
Hello, Ralph. How'd you make out with those nurses last night, Ralph?
He coming home right now.
Because I called up Tommy's brother Joe, and I said, "Joe, she's driving me crazy. Why don't you take her for a couple of years?" And he said, "Oh no!" I know I sound like a terrible woman...
All right, Ginnie. I don't wanna talk anymore about it.  I don't think I got one hour's sleep the whole night.  Last night was the first time in my life I ever heard my mother cry, you know that?
Tommy...
I know what you're gonna say. A man's gotta stop being his mother's baby sooner or later. How many times you gonna say it? She's my mother, you know. I oughta have some feelings about her, don't you think?
Y'all were short a couple cutters and we're what the Army sent.
Never this close.
Stop him! Stop that man!
How you, Walt? We was just fixing to have a nightcap.
It certainly isn't Henry's fault Hot Lips Houlihan doesn't like her name.
Thou. For Thou art with me.  Welcome, welcome, welcome!
Make it yourself, or is it real?
What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?
Little light reading matter. Just right for his age.
This kid's ready but we won't know all the damage till we get in and see what's happened. What have you got?
Must be Painlees Pole Day in the Shower Tent.
Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice.  It's a different ritual but it works the same.
Never mind. Forget it.
I guess that's why you go for Hot Lips Houlihan.
Where the hell we going to get us a football team?
How come nobody knows about him? And you do?
When?
We could steal one of the choppers.
There's no point appealing to Colonel Blake. They've got him bewitched.
I was just asking...
You betcher ass, Dad.
And there it is.
Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow.
Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
But he's got five times the man-power to draw on.
Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer.
That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
Listen, we look pretty lousy out there, right?
See you.
Our minds?
For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
Same here.
You're on his side all of the sudden?
It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
Do you think anything between us could be impersonal? Or pure? You better forget logic, because you're proving why I shouldn't go to bed with you.
You're asking for somebody else?
You please excuse...  I have been making examination of this young man to find if he will be soldier in our army.
It was really nice of you to take me along.
You really say the cutest things.
Captain Camembert! Captain Camembert!
The real Trapper John? The one who threw you the famous pass and went to greater glory on the Boston and Maine Railroad?
What do you do in the joint besides pimp?
What's wrong with him?
How much time do I have?
Officer all sleep now, yes? And I go wash clothes.
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
You mean who hit who?
Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.
Stop that, O'Rielly!
Good morning, Colonel.
Morning, Radar. How were things?
Well, there's one big satisfaction.
The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
Can you guys take one minute to look at a kid for me?
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column.
Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.
Yeah. No, no!  No! No, look. You don't have to smell the world! 
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
Against anything. Just protest.
Who?
Say, he's a friend of mine.
Yes, sir.
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
Darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. People are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. If you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? If your father were alive, he'd know what to say.
Wait a minute . . .
That's your father's diary, Ann.
What letter?
We'll get a handwriting expert to  What!
John Doe.
Now, then comes the drama. He meets discouragement. He finds the world has feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So what does he do?  He decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization. He thinks of the river!  But no, no, he has a better idea. The City Hall. Why?  Because he wants to attract attention. He wants to get a few things off his chest, and that's the only way he can get himself heard.
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
All right, boys, here he is.
Well, maybe you're right.
Yeah, but it's got everybody sore. Ads are being pulledthe Governor's starting a libel suitwhat's more, they all know John Doe's a phoneyand they insist on seeing him.
Well, nobody asked yuh.
I ain't seen him for a week.
He's watching the other door.
Yeah, Boss?
Gee whiz, Boss, you know Mr. Norton told me not to leave him, not even for a minute.
Hey, whatsa matter with a bank account, anyway?
The heelots!
Hey, Doc, look. Look, Doc. Gimme that again, will yuh? Who's gonna get him?
Grubbel's here. See? 
Jitterbugs.[9] Close shot: JOHN and the COLONEL.
Hello, Mr. Connell.
Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does!  Wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!
You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
Well?
I see. I'd better stick to running the paper, huh?
I think maybe you'd better. And ConnellI'd like to have the John Doe contract, all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter Miss Mitchell wrote, for which I gave her a thousand dollars.
If you ask me, Hank, you're playing around with dynamite.
No, she just left. I'm surprised you didn't run into her. She went over to Mr. Norton's house.
Well, you know how they are in baseballif a guy's mixed up in a racket
I know one way you can do it.
Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!
I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.
Apartment 306.
You want me to go up with you?
What's the line?
I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
Don't make do it, Mike.
I won't get away with it.
How can I help you with the particles?
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
Roper...
I'm sorry about your friend. I had a friend in SWAT killed. I know how it can be.
Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
You caught me on an "up" day.  How about you? How did you end up in San Francisco?
How are we gonna get him out of there?
Come on. Let's go for a drink.
Where did you hear that?
No.
Yes.
What did you see?
That's okay. That's his style.
COME ON RUSSELL!...  Who the fuck's Russell?!
How much you wanna bet?
See this. Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty.
I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
That's a chance I gotta take.
McCall, you all right?
I ain't interested in your life story.
Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
And why the fuck would you do that for me?
Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
Greg.
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
Hey.
It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.
Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
Mmm, needs a little something.
It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.
...the hell are you talking about?
Where's the damn wire?!
Depends. What's up?
What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
The car is part of the deal.
I want to be put on this case.
Roper...
Yeah, they are but...
I have found in life that what one wants isn't nearly as important as what one needs.
How come I can't remember?
Guests?
Wake up?!
But what would happen to me?  I have no body to return to.
It's not real.
Where the hell are you going?
Unfinished business.
He had access to the keys --
You're jumping to conclusions.
Try harder.
Why?
We drugged her.  So she wouldn't remember.
I've got to get back.
-- You told me.
Because you'll never believe me.
It was just there.
Resurrection.
Transmit copy of program via satellite north uplink.
Destination?
Access established.
It's far too dangerous.  Zordon would never allow it.
Let's teach these vermin a few manners.
You okay?
I am the wolf, cunning and swift!
Of course!  The power is of another world.  Another dimension.
Two thirty three a.m.
THREE DEGREES OFF THE COMETS TRAJECTORY!
009843... 42... 41!  WE'RE IN ALIGNMENT!
I'm outta here.
Simon says...
Did these sticks make a whistling sound?
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.
But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.
Awwh, Charlie.
Ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do.
The commission don't decide how I spend my honeymoon.
Boo-Boo.
So what happened?
Life knocked me back.
I came into this world flat on my ass.
We'll start small. When we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. Only sell the best stuff. And keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.
Lad, I'm a busy man. July's always a big month for murder. Fella named Barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear.  Black Hand.
But Maranzano's got the men and the brains.
Masseria's confused. He can't figure whether you're workin' for Maranzano, or gettin' ready to kill the bastard. So he's spreadin' the word that you're goin' after Profaci because it happened on his turf. I figure Masseria's gonna try to rub out Profaci, and pin it on us. Then Maranzano will have to kill ya.
You got men on Profaci's place?
Masseria's tryin' ta find a way around ya. But his patience won't hold out much longer.
Well...
I can just imagine.
Luciano.
At least Masseria plays by the rules. Maranzano thinks he's God, and the rules don't apply.
I'll talk to Nucky. Get you set up like the fuckin' Prince of Wales.
Like Don Maranzano.
It's just that Maranzano's the only bastard I ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the IRS. He came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink.
Whatta ya mean, Boss?
He's trying to make it.
You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano.
So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.
MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT!
You got no fuckin' choice. You might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes.
What are ya thinkin'?
Not stupid. Fat.
The Internal Revenue came to my offices. I turned over all my ledgers. They found nothing. Charlie, I am a businessman.
Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us.
If you give him the chance, Lansky will betray you like Judas.
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
Forget it. That's past.
The Big Picture.
And what do you want out of this?
So we're gonna knock 'em both off?
Maranzano wants you dead.
Everybody's talkin' about ya, Charlie. First time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived.
Guess I'm just lucky.
Kill them! Kill them!
Awww... deep down I'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.
Who did this?
Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
"4/17: Subject, when unaware of observation, prefers to hold eating utensils...with feet. Successfully carves turkey roll holding eating utensils...with feet."
Aw, buck up. Have another 'tini.
Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me <u>die</u>.
Now Death is not what you would call a people person, like me. Death is a <u>putz</u> - and I should know. I'm his little brother.
You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
Oh, Julie...my poor Stu...my poor baby brother...
An hour ago. <i></i> I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he would be like, like <u>this</u>. I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay?
I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring.
Go. Just <u>go</u>.
Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
Pact? Pact? NO LIFE SUPPORT??
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?
Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.
Who told you we deal drugs?
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
What about the fellow in those pictures?
You know, you never tell me anything.
Don, this is my mother.  Mom, this is my boss, Don Palmer.
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
Those busts up there--all around the wall--who are they, sonny?
I did not--
Looks like it, but--
Let's send out a pigeon!
That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up.
No, not yet, Senator Paine--not hide nor hair of the man. You mean to say the boys haven't--?
Would you settle for a husband?
Oh--that again. Yeah.
Ah. One of the supporting characters.
Did you like the first act?
They decoyed the little General off to a tea party to keep him out of the Senate.
What dame?
Tonight?
Yeah--that's right. Diz--
Yeah, I know. That's okay.
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
Susan? Nah!
You know, we're getting married.
What!
Not a word! Taylor's sewed up every paper. They're tossing out everything that comes in over the wires!
Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
No, no--believe me, pet--this is *most* urgent--  Hello, hello. Is Taylor there?-- Governor Hopper. Quickly, please--
Nonsense. Why don't you listen to your children for a change? You might actually learn something?
No wonder--without your dinner.
Relax, Happy. Jim said to wait.
Terrific! A born stooge! Horace'll perform like a trained seal.
Oh--oh.
Look here, Jim--if you and Joe are going to gab about this appointment *any* longer, I'm going ahead and see those committees!
Henry Hill.
*But you never asked me*!
Well--that's not work, sir--that's fun.
What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting you down?
He's the greatest *American* we got, too, Dad. Can tell what George Washington said--by heart. An' "Boy Stuff's" got the swellest stuff in it.
Yes. Come in.
A pet shop?
Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
Will the Senator yield for a question?
Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on...
Goodnight, Jeff.
Jeff--listen--this was all taken up in the State Legislature and approved-- they're going to divert waters from up above--
Yield *how*, sir?
Ah, now, that's better.
Does my colleague's piece concern Section Forty of the bill--a dam on Willet Creek?
Certainly would, Joseph.
Yes, so I was told, Mr. Taylor, but--
Yes! I've told Senator Paine for twenty years--
Convene?
Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
You *couldn't*?
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it--
Why?
Look--committees--small groups of Senators--have to sift a Bill down-- look into it--study it--and report to the whole Senate. You can't take a Bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men. Where would you get?
Good. Where are we?
Some committee's got it.
Uh--have you?  Did you ever have so much to say about something--you couldn't say it?
Yes, yes--
But--I mean--for a woman--And--you've done awfully well--
Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
Great.
Do you mean all--look--look we'd better open them up--see what they say here--look at the money--what does it say--"Dear Senator Smith, I would like to come to your boy's camp and I shine shoes at the station and here's nine cents." Oh, isn't that wonderful. Look and he signs it. "Yours truly, Stinky Moore." Isn't that marvelous?  Say--have I got some paper here?
Don't mention it--
Get your hat, Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--
It might save some of the pieces, Jeff. It would leave a doubt about the whole thing--about you. Might blow over, this way.
Saunders--if there was *any* way--
Jeff--wait--they want you to speak!
Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--
A camp! Well!
Fine--they're fine.  Oh, Miss Paine, I--I want to apologize-- what the papers said I said about you--that wasn't true. I--I would never say a thing like that.
"So help me God."
I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.
How'd you like a punch in the nose?
I wouldn't wait if I were you.
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
What does he want to--? What's *he* doing writing a Bill?
--amazing coincidence! Of all places in the world--to choose Willet Creek for his boys' camp!
Your Ranger's on the garbage pile, Happy! He's done for!
I meant it for one. I meant--Sam Foley couldn't get along without you-- and neither can I at the moment--
And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see--
Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now--  I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--
What are you driving at? You want *me* to get him to sign that?
Joe--I've got a lot of people to take care of in this State.
What do you think?
Oh, I see. Out steamroller methods are getting too hard to your sensitive soul, is that it, Joe? The Silver Knight is getting to big for us. My methods have been all right for the past twenty years, Joe, since I picked you out of a fly-specked hole in the wall and blew you up to look like a Senator, and now you can't stand it. Well, maybe you won't have to stand it, Joe. Maybe we can fix it so you and your Boy Ranger can go home together.
Jim, you don't have to--
Jim--the boy's talking to that State-- the story is out--!
How nice.
Well, at the expense of some of the furniture, Susan--you've made another conquest.
We'd like to get in touch with him. It's very important.
Sometimes he whistles.
Yes.
Are they true!
It isn't all! I'd like to explain
Couldn't sleep. Kinda wanted to talk to you. Do you mind?
In a day or so, I think.
Well, here we are again.
What's up, Babe? Something's eating you.
Uh-huh.
Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have
Cinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this?
Why, Babe - that's terrific!  "Cinderella Man Woos Mystery Girl! Who is the Mysterious Girl That"
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
Oh, as bad as that, huh?
Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
Yes, sir.
Perfect! Perfect!
Let me go! I wanna see him!
Your Honor, I object.
It's a lie!
Mr. Cedar!
Newspaperman?
Hang up.
I guess we'd better try somebody else.
Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?
Mr. Longfellow Deeds?
Why, no.
Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates.
No, thanks.
Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
This afternoon - at four o'clock.
Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
Come on, come on. What are you trying to do, kid? Keel over? You haven't been out of this house in two weeks.
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
Now, where were we?
Uh-huh.
Sorry to keep you waiting so long. Those opera people are funny. They wanted me to put up $180,000.
What about it, Mr. Deeds?
Of course, we don't want to appear greedy, Mr. Deeds.
You're making a mistake, Mr. Deeds.
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
Proceed.
Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
New mouthpiece. Been waiting two weeks for this. Kids keep swiping them all the time. They use 'em for bean shooters.  What can I do for you gentlemen?
No, sir.
Please!
But she's on the telephone
Why are they ganging up against me?
We argued on Sunday. He went to work on Monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. But on Thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. Didn't call either. Not till Saturday afternoon.
Mr. Cook.
We're not sure. She's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things. Some of 'em are callin' it --  -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue Symptom...
That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
Well... you see, when I broke it off with Phyllis, she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain -- how to put it -- doubts she's been harboring...
What's that?
You find it distasteful, don't you?
Go to hell.
I was... never satisfied.
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford. Jeremy Brockett.
Clarence Norman White, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged?
So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
You like me. How come?
Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful?  You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
Lily.
I don't want you to be mad at Skip...
You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
Got a license?  But no car?
Do you think that's a good idea?
Wow. You're something.
Feel free to lie down. Most people do.
Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?
Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.
We don't discuss it.
You've got a funny idea of funny.
I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.
There... I've given myself a real whopper.
In the capitol for Boy's Nation. Five days. Why?
Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
That's one way to put it.
It might've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor-patient relationship.
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
The point is this -- I am not a blank page. I did not just fall off the turnip truck. Do you know what I mean?
...How violated I feel?
But...
We're only talking about six weeks.
What happened today?
How are you?
No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from?
I understand.
I've got three big ones.
She's probably ten years older than you.
Good-looking woman.
Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday...
Okay... let's say that, for now.
Sounds like kind of a good idea.
Damn! What is your name?
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
I know it starts with a birth certificate...
I'm here for you, Doc.
When?
How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways?
Goin' somewhere?
Where's your new friend?
What does he want the book for?
Like what that Moses guy did to that Pharaoh guy?
You will not believe it.
-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
Yeah, I was there.
What did you find? What did you see?
Relax! I'm the map!  It's all up here.
That "thing" gets me excited.
Seems the Americans had a little misadventure of their own today, three of their diggers were killed.
You two!
You don't believe in curses, huh?
I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But I'm proud of what I am.
Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one.
You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?
I can't believe the price of these fleabags.
Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
That thing gives me the creeps.
Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out.
Tough break.
Who's here!?
Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!
Where are you going?
You two timing psychotic bastard.
And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway.
That's two more than the Fantastic Four.
Mon Captain, it's for you. 
Are you an actress?
Hi.
I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home?
What have they got that we ain't got?
Me, too.
Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --
And what if you get killed?
You're the Sphinx.
Or flowers.
The who?
He's turned into a completely normal person!
Are you famous?
Not yet.
Jeffrey!
Oh, Mother, I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a family -- but it's just not who I am!
I use it... to fight evil.
This looks like a job for Superman --
If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.
Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.
What do you mean?
Yes, Captain?  Have you anything you wish to say?
What do you have in mind?
Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
But who made this treaty?
I don't know, sire.
That is incredible.
I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine.
She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
Come back in an hour.
Bastia -- and you?
You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
Just a minute, General.  Listen, don't let them fool you with all their grand la-de-da.  They've all made their money from the war -- mostly from crooked war contracts. They say Citizen Barras has put away millions.
Why didn't you wake me then?
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
How did it spread so quickly?
From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city.  The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city.
He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
No, sir.
I fear our meeting is long overdue... Napoleon.
Shall we move closer to the fire?
Will Alexander be joining us soon?
Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice.
But you can do the same thing in six months.  The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life.
Are you trying to insult me?
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
Will you use the troops?
Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
May I offer you a drink?
Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.
Yes, I'm afraid he is.  I believe he is riding.  I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.
I thought I was.  I was confused.
Were you in love with any of them?
Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
I will be there in five minutes.  Go back to your guests.
Five minutes.
Separate bedrooms?
Who is it?
I didn't mean the things that I said... I was angry and I said more than I meant to.
God damn it, Junot, wouldn't you think I have enough things on my mind not to waste time on a letter like this to Joseph?
What are you talking about?
I didn't want to hurt you... All I wanted to do was to keep from hurting you.  I swear I didn't want to hurt you.
I wrote it.
I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn't the courage to deal with it yourself.
Good day, monsieur.  Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?
My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.
Oh, then you are...
Of course, my dear.
I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.
Does she deserve anything better?
Do you think Alexander has any chance to succeed as a mediator?
What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force.
And where do you place Alexander?
What did you say his name was?
Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
That's it?
Stretch it out.
Naw, I already ate.
It's about to work, just come on.
Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
Man, Day-Day is my people!
I can't see!  I can't see!  Daddy!
You straight?
Man, it's a long story.  I met D'Wana three months ago.  She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention.  Come to find out, she six months pregnant.  Saying I'm the daddy!
I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life.
Yo know what?  I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga.
What you mean, so?
You walked?
How can they do this?
$247.
Thanks a lot, Craig.
I know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters.
It works.
Naw.  I bet'cha it's something better than air.
You go first.
Karla.
Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good together.  Where you going?
I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes.
I'll be out in about 35-40 minutes!
Here I come!
Must be your upper lip, 'cause I don't smell nothing.
You too.
That the big one, huh?
I do.
I say we go over there and kick their asses.  I can take the little one.
Roach...Roach, come on.
Where's Craig?
When my back gets better I'mma beat the black off you, Day-Day.
Why would he take it?  He don't even know you.
Just do it.
William.
I thought you were taking me to see Mama?
Okay, okay, that's enough.  Go put on some damn clothes.
Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
Where'd you come from?
San Diego.
That's right.
What?
For what?
This says "invitation only".
I killed you.
I want'to talk to her.
I talk to her or you can forget about it.
Is that something precious?
My wife always said I had a problem trusting people.
I don't know.
Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
Ready?
Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. Right?
Lynn!
No...kisses to you.
No. Kisses to you.
What do you do, if I may be so bold?
It's a twenty.
What are you supposed to do?
What are you going to do!?
For the last time, I don't want it cleaned. Now get the hell out of here!
Fuckin' A.
Hey!
This is what they call the jack. Hi, Jack!
Why?
A surprise?
You got this under control?
Come Back.
What religion do you profess, Preacher?
Keep talkin', Preacher.
Here they come.
I been mindin' Pearl.
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
You have all sinned!
Throw that money in the River! In THE RIVER!
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
You swore, Pearl!
It's all here.
If we stay here somethin' awful will happen to us.
Where are we goin', John?
Get in the skiff, Pearl, goodness, goodness, hurry!
Are we goin' home, John?
About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.
You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
What's that you're playing with, boy?
She thinks that money's in the river, but you and me, we know better, don't we, boy?
I'm hungry.
Mister Powell?
That's mighty brave of you, Reverend.
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be safe in promisin' you that.
She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.
He never asked me for nothin'.
Nancy have any severe childhood illnesses? Scarlet Fever? High temperatures -- concussions?
Because he was scary, that's why.
Sometimes I wish you didn't live right across the street.
M'god, I look twenty years old.  You have any weird dreams last night?
One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.
You believe in anything?
Whenever I get nervous I eat.
And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what?
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
Much better.
Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to.  Listen, I... I know who he is.
You do?
Rod's not a lunatic.
Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
Sure, okay, I'll be there. Now you just turn in and get some rest, sweetheart. Please. Deal?
How you know that?
Where you think you're going?
Nancy, don't fall asleep in there.
Get into bed.
What?
Do you think I did it?
I can't believe his mother let him come over here.
What you dream?
When did you have a nightmare?
From Leon.
Good evening, Anna.
I see.
You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
An evening gown.
What do you wear in the morning?
Just for the honeymoon.
Are we free, Buljanoff?
If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason.
Is there anything I can do for you, monsieur?
Good morning, Gaston.
Count d'Algout is still asleep.
Well, sir, if you should do it again, which I hope you won't, please remember the order. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.
Oh, you're a reactionary! Don't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say, "Hey, you, d'Algout! from now on it's going to be share and share alike"?
General, would you mind making my excuses at our table? I'll be back in a few moments.
Only one in the rear, I'm afraid.
Comrades, why should we lie to each other? It's wonderful.
If Lenin were alive he would say, "Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in your life you're in Paris. Don't be a fool. Go in there and ring three times."
Yes, Leon...
But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French. Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?
Only myself and two other girls. One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor.
Now, monsieur, you have no right...
All right, then make an appointment with her so I can see her!
If there is anything we can do for you...
Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow!
The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
Yes. It is unfortunate.
That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.
Pardon me, I am very interested in what you just said -- you mean when an envoy goes back to Russia -- if they don't like what he has done they put him out of the way?
What business?
Private.
But you had!
I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl.
That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.
Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
Love to.
Why do you need my finger?
That's a strange angle.
You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you.
I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?
Does that mean that you want me to go there?
Then why don't we go?  You might be an interesting subject of study.
Well, may I offer you a drink, or how about something to eat?
What do we do now?
And what is your profession?
Ni-notchka.
That is correct.
What kind of a girl are you, anyway?
Thank you.
Glorious, analytical...
I must go.
As a representative of Moscow...
This is a place for workmen.
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
Will you smile?
A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
You see I couldn't shout that.
Leon, I would like to ask you something.
I promise... I swear.
A funny story?
Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
No speech?
But I can throw it out of the window.
Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer.
My little Volga boatman! Stop threatening! I don't deserve this.  Are you my little Volga boatman?
It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!
Make it ice cold.
You saw all that in one glimpse?
I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
There are a hundred ways to approach it, but I feel it can best be said in one simple phrase. I'm in love, Swana.
Has done what?
Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted.
Good morning.
How stale last night's gaiety looks! It has the taste of a dead cigarette.
You leave me no choice.
Yes, it does.
I haven't either, but I've heard about them. You must realize it was only on the strength of your Paris report that I sent them to Constantinople; without that I never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal.
Yes... leaving immediately.
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
I don't understand.
Raw carrots and beets.
Where is that?
I remember one birthday of His Majesty, our beloved Czar... I had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace... I still see you bending before His Majesty... You wore your diadem and a necklace... your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels.
You're lawyers.  How can you let this shit go by!  Look!  This?  Nixon can't say this.
For Christ's sake, it soils my mother's memory.  Do you think I want the whole goddamn world to see my mother like this?  Raising a dirty mouth!
We'll see about that ...
I agree it's ridiculous but --
I'll bet he would.
How the hell do you have the temerity to blackmail the President of the United States?
To protect his people.
I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.
Let's not forget they're just kids, they don't vote.
How so?
Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"? That'll be the day.  The whole suit of armor'd fall off.
Hunt?  Howard Hunt?
I don't know if I'd go that far, sir.
He's in the dumps, sir.  Agnew.  Every time you have him attack the press, they give it back to him in spades. He's become the most hated man in America.
I would personally enjoy doing that, sir.
No, sir, you did not.
It's the President's personal property!  I will never give up my tapes to a bunch of Kennedy-loving Harvard Democrat cocksuckers!
Who the fuck does Cox think he is?  I never made a dime from public office!  I'm honest.  My dad died broke.  You know the sonofabitch went to law school with Jack Kennedy? ... The last gasp of the Establishment! They got the hell kicked out of 'em in the election, so now they gotta squeal about Watergate 'cause we were the first real threat to them in years. And by God, Al, we would have changed it, changed it so they couldn't have changed it back in a hundred years, if only ...
About a dozen.
... an action that will at last, once and for all, show that what I knew and what I did with regard to the Watergate break-in and cover-up were just as I have described them to you from the very beginning ...
So?
Three days before, on the June twentieth tape -- the one with the eighteen-minute gap --
I had nothing to do with that.  Was he ... in the Ellsberg thing?
Howard Hunt? ... Jesus Christ, you open up that scab ... and you uncover a lot of pus.
"National security priority restricted and controlled secret."
Bob, did I approve the Ellsberg thing? You know, I'm glad we tape all these conversations because ... I never approved that break-in at Ellsberg's psychiatrist.  Or maybe I approved it after the fact?  Someday we've got to start transcribing the tapes.
... and we've got the economic guys at five.  The Dow lost another 16 points. They're going to want a decision on the budget.  Sir?  ... Are we holding the line on a balanced budget?
Mr. President!
You know, they all miss the point. Probably our biggest achievement as an administration, when it's all said and done, isn't China or Russia.  It's pulling out of Vietnam without a right wing revolt.
I believe you're right, boss.
My God, my God!  He talked to the New York Times?
Because Harold tests thy father's will is no reason to admire him.  Let Harold's worldliness be a warning to thee, not an example.
It's meant to make us stronger.  Thou art stronger than Harold ... stronger than Arthur.  God has chosen thee to survive ...
Robert Cushman is a lieutenant general in the Marine Corps, the Deputy Director of the CIA ... and this is what you use him for?
I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
Mr. Castro.
Yes.
... But it has never been the policy of this government to accept that. And it is certainly not CIA policy.
I never thought Jack was ready for the presidency.  But I would never, never consider ...  His death was awful, an awful thing for this country.  Do you ever think of death, Mr. Helms?
What do you think this plan is, Edgar? A nuclear attack?
Ummm...
You asked if you could count on my support ... As long as I can count on yours.
The little bastards think they can ruin Tricia's wedding day by dancing naked in the Reflecting Pond.
Who do you think is behind it?
He's obsessed with his own image.  He wants his Nobel Peace Prize a little too much.  As the late "Doctor" King proved -- even an ape can win a prize with good press.
So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
Mein Kampf?
Anything goes wrong, head for your homes, just sit tight -- you'll hear from me or Howard.
Only if Kennedy dumps Johnson.
... as the old alliances crumble.
Finally someone who's noticed!  I'm a great admirer of yours, too, Mr. Nixon.  You are an unusual politician. We share a mutual idol -- "Six Crises" sounds like a page from Churchill.
I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry.  What do you think?
Exactly, sir.  That is your historical contribution: to lead boldly in an era of limits.
That's right!  And if necessary, I'll drop the big one.
Do you ever pray?  You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?
Just ... uh ... you know.
Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?
We let you down, didn't we.  Your people.
Don't ever trust them.  They never tell the truth or honor their commitments.  Vietnamese are like Russians.  Both are dogs.
But I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied about knowing Chambers.  The documents were old and out of date, like these Pentagon Papers.  The key thing we proved was that Hiss was a liar.  Then people bought it that he was a spy.  It's the lie that gets you.
Let's get out of here; it's too painful.  I hate it.  We went bowling last weekend.  Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
Uh, wait ...
It wasn't your fault.  The soldiers were just kids, too.  They panicked.
Edgar, wonderful to see you.  Clyde ... hi.
Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.
Where you from?
That's Julie ... and that's Tricia. She, uh, reminds me a little bit of you ...
I like jazz ...
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
... but it depends on what I'm doing to the music, Dick ...
We got the press this time!
Sir?
It's not fair, Buddy.  I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing.  I hate it.
It's over, Dick.
Everything's political, for Christ's sake!  I'm political.  And you're political, too!
We can be happy.  We really can.  We love you, Dick.  The girls and I...
Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
I don't want them to love me.
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.
Thank you.
Repartee, Dick -- very good.  Hey, I feel ten years younger!  It makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life?
To what?
The "crises"?
How'd you know I was here.
Cats? Several. Wal. Depends what you mean by got. Some are half-wild, and some are just outlaws.
How fresh is this coffee?
Yes, you've circled round.
...Shot down on his own porch there in Hudspeth County. There was seven or eight of 'em come to the house. Wantin' this and wantin' that. Mac went back in and got his shotgun but they was way ahead of him. Shot him down in his own doorway.  Aunt Ella run out and tried to stop the bleedin'. Him tryin to get hold of the shotgun again. They just set there on their horses watchin' him die. Finally one of 'em says somethin' in Injun and they all turned and left out. Well Mac knew the score even if Aunt Ella didn't. Shot through the left lung and that was that. As they say.
When did he die?
I'm... discouraged.
I thought maybe she was with your boy there.
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
If you'd a told me twenty years ago I'd see children walkin' the streets of our Texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses I just flat out wouldn't of believed you.
He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.
I don't know. Sometimes I think he's pretty much a ghost.
Would you tell me if you had?
Some pretty bad people.
Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
That's the boy.
That's possible.
Probably must be.
You think this boy Moss has got any notion of the sorts of sons of bitches that are huntin' him?
What was the bullet?
Yessir. Wasn't none.
Yes Noreen you better had. Thank you.
No sir.
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.
No.
To your husband.
No. I found it.
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
...If I don't come back tell Mother I love her.
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.
Promise?
Mama's gonna raise hell.
Not any more, Carla Jean. You're retired.
What did I know to tell him. You're hurt, ain't you?
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna leave you in the lurch.
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
Mm-hm.
...Where's the transponder?
What airport would you use.
I don't know.
What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo?
Didn't mean nothin'.
I was just passin' the time.
You don't know what you're talking about, do you?
I could come back then.
We lived in Temple Texas for many years. Raised a family there. In Temple. We come out here about four years ago.
You married into it.
Uh-huh. Double ought.
Well I guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard Per-Gola. You can stand up in it. Well, some people could stand up in it. Six foot clearance at the ridge. You might just could.
Good. I need everything else.
November the 28th, last year.
If your expenses run higher I hope you'll trust us for it.
Yes?
I'm sorry.
You want to change rooms?
What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
Sugar?
Took me about three hours.
What product.
No sir. I'm a veteran.
Hey, Sheriff. How's everything?
I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?
Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
...you are so goddamn weird.  Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!
Did you send anyone out there?
One question, Doctor, please!  You can't do this! I'm the press, I have rights!!
Just shut up a second and listen... That, uh... that bar in Arizona? Where you said Betty was?
They're fine... you miss it?
This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
...I... I know what you are.
I'm appreciably older than you, but my health is good. I take care of myself, and I got some money socked away. You'd never have to work again, that's for sure. I'd treat you like a queen.
I better go check on them.
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
I'd rather not...
So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
Maroon.  I stole it.
What?
Let me know if you need anything, okay?
All the time...
Sue Ann, I thought you of all people would back me up on this, you know what Del's like. How did he take my note?
Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch eventually, but I still owe him one.
I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del?
I guess we all did.  You know, I didn't marry Leslie because I loved her. I married her to forget you...
She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
David, please --
But I'm David... I mean, I'm not David, but she thinks I am! You heard her...  Stop staring at me... I'm not crazy, she is!
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
Make sure it's elevated...
I'll go to the Hospital.
Like Rome?
Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie --
I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.
No, that's not, I couldn't...
You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.
David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
Who?
Either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it, or you got serious problems. Which one is it?!
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
He is real.
Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
Sure did! And a funny thing, Betty, he introduced himself to me as George!
Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
The fuck you talking about?
Of what?
I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
I don't follow...
I... I don't know...
This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is.
What 'look'?
I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that?
Betty, Betty, Betty...
So what the fuck's a Finn?
What?
They paid us half. They still owe us half...
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
What doesn't?
I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
She can't be here because of a... a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make her...
Don't  Don't you talk about Betty like that. I don't care who she ends up being, you never use that word again. Got it?
If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
I don't know, George...
I'll think about it.
This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who...
Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
Uh-huh.
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.
I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
Aren't they precious?  Ma'am, she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband. Does she have any relatives in the area?
No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
Yeah?
I like to think that I'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene.
Waitaminute -
Hang on there -
We didn't abandon you, Pete, we just thought you was a toad.
Huh?!
But there were witnesses, saw us redeemed!
I just don't think it's right, keepin' him under wraps like we's ashamed of him.
We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.
Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.
I'm sayin' we har this man away.
Finest governor we've ever had in M'sippi.
Wipin' little circles with his bread.
McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.
Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.
All's well that ends well, as the poet says.
Or, it might a been under the mattress.
Huh?! They dam that river on the 21st.  Today's the 17th!
Don't I know it.
...Nah, that ain't right... I'm thinkin' of...
I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!
I couldn't wait two weeks! She's gettin' married tomorra!
Who's the honcho around here?
Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can.
They cut a record in here, few days ago, old-timey harmony thing with a guitar Accump-accump-uh-
Holy-moly. These boys're a hit!
That's a maiden name.
This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
Great.
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
Who?  Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.
I never said any of that!
Pity you don't have the character.
Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
Congratulations, Ensign Mayo, sir!
What did you call me, Mayo?
Yes, sir!
I know I'm late and I'm sorry, but Mrs. Rufferwell asked us to help with the cleanup and...
I don't know what it is. It could be anything.
Don't you dare ask me that question. I'm an adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like that!
You been through the Dilbert Dunker yet?
He was. He died.
I had a big brother who died over there, too. He wasn't no flyer though. He was just your basic Marine Corps type. I was only twelve when it happened, so I don't remember much about him.
You're sure it's okay?
Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?
Let's go tell Paula! God, I wonder where we'll be stationed first. I hope it'll be Hawaii. I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.
Sid, there's no baby.
Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?
Yeah... Mmmm...
You serious about having him over?
Paula, how far would you go to catch Zack?
God help you, Lynette!
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.
You got a girl?
Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing.
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.
Paula, I never try to fool anybody about who I am, what I want... so if even in the back of your --
That was great.
I'll get it if you want.
You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly.
Hi.
No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you.
Why'd he do it?
Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay?
I'd like to come with you.
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
How about that prick! He told me he wasn't officer material because he grew up poor like me.
He said he grew up poor?
Think there's any truth to what he was saying about those girls? Is that still going on?
No problem, but who's Susan?
I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan?
But she expects you to marry her?
He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter.
What?
So what the fuck are we supposed to do?!
Me.  I am.
Two.  Squeeze harder.
The hell does she want?
You're wasting your fucking time, man, you're wasting my time.  You don't know how to do this, and the longer we stay in here, the more likely she's gonna lose it and call the cops!
That's your problem.
YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!
Forty-five minutes.  That's all you said you need.  That's like nothing.
What about us?  What if she has a gun?
I met him at the tables, same as you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
They're gonna die in there!
She's never coming out.
And we're never getting in.
I mean it!
If you think I'm gonna let my half of the fourteen million bucks slip away because of --
No cars.  Feet are faster.
How many more do we have after this?
Got us in here, didn't I?
Don't.
What am I, a five year old?
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three..."
Why?
Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  Did you see any sugar in here?  Any candy bars, anything sweet?
Huh uh.
Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Little Bobby... Just a kid...
Lemme see that rifle son...
Drugs Judge, they're gonna flood West Oakland with dope. Jack you up and string you out like a two dollar whore. And while the community's shuffling for a fix, they're gonna snuff every Panther they can find.
Sabu, what the fuck you doing? Ain't nobody gonna push on this street.
Sabu... High white dude's the only thing you could hustle.
I ain't gonna tell you no more. No pushing in the neighborhood, especially not on my fucking street. You're killing your own people asshole.
Motherfucker... you stay away...
Yeah, it was alright. Hey, can you give me a lift?
I see. What about the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense?
This here's a "Panther Patrol." We see a brother getting busted. We check it out, make sure the pig don't go beating on the man. Brother gets taken downtown, we post bail, hook 'em up with a lawyer.
No thank you sister.  Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you?
Tell that to the pigs. Better yet tell that to Malcolm.
Don't I know it. Every brother I knew in 'Nam's dead. My company... a land mine. Twenty of my friends dead in less than a second.
Huey, you're losing me. What are you talking about?
Motherfuckers...
Motherfuck... well then I got something to do.
You don't look alright.
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
You couldn't have known.
Two pounds, fourteen ounces.
Yes, sir.
What unit?
Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other.  There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men.
Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?
My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.
Colonel Tarleton, you deal with these damned rebels.
It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley.
Probably.
And the Governor?
He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body.
Father, I've lost respect for you. I thought you were a man of principle.
Alright, Corporal, you take Bennington, Harrisville, Acworth and the farms along Black Swamp.  I'll take the north side of the river. We'll meet at Snow's Island.
You learned her lessons better than I.
Please.
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
Thirteen years...
And your principles?
Green Dragoons came to my home, killed my son, Thomas.  It was Tarleton himself.
The bigger problem is where, not when.  The French fleet won't sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early storms.
I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.
Margaret, take William and Susan to the river shed.  Hide there.  If we're not back by dawn, go up the river to the Richardson's house. They'll take you to your Aunt Charlotte's farm.  Nathan, Samuel, and I are going to get Gabriel.
It's a good measure of a woman that she'll have her honeymoon under the stars.
Gray.
Worse.
Seventeen.
Father, you can't let them take him...
Father... I killed those men...
Do you know what this place is, Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing and even a whole pile of 'em don't amount to much. Do you know what a graveyard really is?
I want to fly it! Can I fly it now, mommy!
Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
Yes.
I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up the money, Ellen.
What's up, sugar?
Was it Pascow?
Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--
Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want.
Nice.
What do you mean?
No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?
Almost there, Louis.
But--
What did we do, Jud?
Don't be silly. Church is not going to die.
I just said--
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
You stole my boat.
Aye, aye, sir!
I'll torture it out of you.
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
Looks like your back to having nothing to offer.
Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner.
The curse drove you to gather this?
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
Man overboard!
I apologize if I seem forward -- but I must speak my mind.  This promotion confirms that I have accomplished the goals I set for myself in my career.  But it also casts into sharp relief that which I have not achieved.  The thing all men most require: a marriage to a fine woman.  You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.
Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
Difficult ... to say.
You are despicable.
Last time, I was here a grand total of three days.  Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.  But from the looks of this, they've been out of business, and so that won't be happening again.  We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.
What are you doing?  You've burned our food, the shade -- the rum!
You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?
Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl.
Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants.  Something he needs.
I'll tell lee.  Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts.  This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --
Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew.  He was marooned on an island, left there to die.
Raise the sails.
No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
Norrington, think about it ... the Black Pearl, its captain and crew ... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean.  How can you pass that up?
Where does it make berth?
Why ask me?
Why are brothering with that?
We're going to steal a ship?  That ship?
It's not true my father was a pirate.
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
Are you certain this is the right way?
You've seen the Black Pearl?
No.
Mentioned it, is more what he did.
No.  She hasn't.
You can't mean that.
She's working as fast as she can, Icarus.  It will be ready soon.
It works, Poppy.  It works, it works!
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
I promise, my dear, I will give the matter some consideration.
If you loved me like I loved you?
Did I?  I've been waiting for that for years.
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
That might work.
Dr. Makeo is working on it now, sir. I estimate at least another six hours.
It'll be better for us if he simply disappears.  The gardener will know what to do.
Why don't you just put this in your pocket so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs.
Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.
Yeah.  But it wasn't a group.  It was one man.
They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
Well, you got another problem.
You mean the designs for the nanobot?  You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
It's Sim.  We're almost there.
Sir, please try to hold still.
He's probably right, sir, the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight.
Susan!
Been out for six months now.
The big house?
I've read they're using it to repair cancer cells.
Yeah, we'll see.
Mouse?  What mouse?
What happened to it?
It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
Daniel!
We don't?
Victim my ass!  You stole my security key and used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage!  Maybe this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved!
Just like old times.
What's wrong?
The nanobot... it's not here...
Did you go?
What would happen if I threw him into the core?
I remember I was trying to help...
Things do change.
You!  I remember you!
Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!
All the different ways that I could kill you.
I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations.
I could have you fired right now.
Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
Don't mind Mother.
I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and  
Really?
Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and I are married.
You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
It isn't cheap. It's nice.
Got my initials on them too. They're cute. They're nice little things - what do you do with them?
You wear them of course, silly.
Gallagher!
Oh, that mob downstairs. I guess I got so interested in the play I forgot all about them.
The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately.
Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I?
Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.
I knew your managing editor very well.
Huh?
Yeah?
Now listen boss, if you're going to kick about that expense account
Why not?
Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.
A what?
What play?
Araby?
You're my what?
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
Do you think your wife would walk up three flights of stairs just to eat out of paper plates?
Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.
My error.
Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
I dyed one and washed the other.
Well, Gallagher! Glad to see you.
I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
You know what I should do with you? I should sock you right in that funny little nose.
Did who?
How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.
I think you'd better go.
Well, at best you might deny it.
Fine, but kinda thirsty.
Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only ten thousandand you didn't even get those letters from that Jezebel!
About what? Your marriage to Anne!
The name is Smythe.
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
Yes sir.
A bird in a gilded cage?
What?
Bud. Mary Sue ... Breakfast is on the table.
It's okay. It's alright.
What?
How was your day?
Oh, George ...
Okay--now you listen to me ...  You're gonna come to this meeting and you're gonna put on this make up, and you're gonna come home at six o'clock every night and have dinner ready on this table.
I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  I'm gonna go now.
Really Biff? The keenest?
Okay, that's IT!!!
"Changes."
No. What?
Are you alright?  What is it?
What happened?
BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
It was accessible to everyone.
See, I know you want it to stay "Pleasant" but there are so many things that are so much better: like Silly ... or Sexy ... or Dangerous ... or Wild ... or Brief ...  And every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them.  Look at those faces back there. They're no different than you are. They just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ...
Hello Bud.
Hear your Dad got a new car.
You know him?
We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be "attractive." They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.
What's wrong?
Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
What?
Are you sure?
Right here.
Rain.
It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
I like calling you David.
I know how I'd feel if mine went out. Almost like losing a friend.
Don't get upset.
A deluge doesn't just "happen." Bolts of lightning don't just "happen" ...  You burned down an ELM tree for Christ's sake ...
Why?
Because you're coming home.
Now Buddy, you're going on trial tomorrow. And if they find you guilty, you're gonna be stuck here forever. Well, not forever--lemme think ...  Five year sentence ... Carry the three ... That comes out to ... sixteen and a half centuries, and that's rounding down.
Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.
Yeah ...
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
... Like the other night, when I closed up by myself. That was different ...
Well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was?
It's beautiful.
Yeah ...
What happened?
Oh GOD ...
I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
So you can't talk to me?
What city?
Somewhere in Utah.
There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.
That's your fault not mine.
I don't think I'm going to the party.
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
It's fine, but --
Goodbye.
Tell me why.
Are you watching a porno movie?
....no....
Are your pants off?
Really?
Yeah....you're married aren't you, Jack?
I'm horny, Jack, what about you?
Sometimes when I'm lonely.
Yes.
Really? Please?
No. No. We got disconnect -- why?.....you're calling me at work....how did you get this number -- ?
Not very well.
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
Yeah, not really.
Oh My God.
It was great to meet you again. To see you again, thanks for helping me yesterday --
How long have you known her?
Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
You see?
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
Yes.
Are you learning how to play it?
So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
Hi.
Really?
I don't freak out.
Hello?
You don't have a boyfriend or anything do you?
How many times have you been on an airplane?
If you give me six to eight weeks I can redeem the mileage and then I can with you wherever you have to travel......
If you wanted to call me back I could...
Yeah.
Please don't do this to me.
What do you mean?
Of course. Would you like to talk to a girl? I can connect you with a beautiful girl if I can just get your credit card number followed by the expiration date?
.....1274 Moorpark. Sherman Oaks, California. #4. 91403.
Barry Egan.
It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
I haven't even told you what's happened. Your girl that you have that works there for you threatened me and two men just chased me -- extorted money -- DEAN Go fuck yourself that shit doesn't have anything to do with me - this is a legitimate bossiness.
You are bad. You are a bad person. you are a bad person and you have no right to take people's confidence in your service --
Can we agree that that is that?
That was weird. I meant good.
Yeah.
I don't like the way I am sometimes.  Can you help me? WALTER Barry, I'm a dentist, what kind of help do you think I can give you?
They need to be scanned individually. They each have a bar code, so I need it scanned individually so that each and every cup appears on the receipt...
This is Barry.
Right now, you're doing nothing?
I know.
I know.
I know.
-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
Uch. Shut up, Dean.
I'll go pay for my car.
He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --
Ok.
No.
I have no idea what he's doing then. I'm sorry that didn't work out.
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
Yes, well, I awoke to discover I'd turned into a cat. If you don't do as I say, I'll sink my little fangs into your drumsticks, and suck the marrow straight out of your bones.
"One day, Fanchon's first client was a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting each and every follicle..."
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
By whom? The Marquis?
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
Yes! It is! The paper's cheap, the type's too small --
But you implored me to write! For curative purposes, to stave off my madness --
Enough to discern its tenor.
It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine.
They can't be serious.
Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE?
I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged.
NEVER!
I FUCKED HER COUNTLESS TIMES! IN EVERY ORIFICE! AND ALL THE WHILE, SHE PLEAD FOR MORE --
This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?
He's made a great success of our Little Theater; there's seldom an empty seat. Not to mention its therapeutic value.
Well...?
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
Unless we set Charenton on a straight and narrow course, she'll be shut down forever by order of the Emperor.
In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
You're a sentimental man.
I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
It was fiction, of course.
That's not our intent --
You'll get more from her with kindness than you will with force.
He'll do no such thing.
If only blood will appease you, then shed mine.
Will you sleep soundly tonight?
I've stared into the face of evil...  ...and I've lived to tell the tale. Now... for your own sake... let me write it down.
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
A kiss for each page.
The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
Surely you've seen a man naked.
The Abbe's sending me away. He fears for me here, what with the likes of you --
It needn't be; not if you've another story.
Go on, child.
You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
If you're truly determined to step out of the shadow of your husband's celebrity --
Public scorn carries a terrible sting. Trust me. I'm a woman who knows.
You've come to lecture me?
Doesn't that please you?
You're just scared.
That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.
It's not so bad here. After all, what girl doesn't want to live in a castle?
Listen, you come down and stay with us for a few days. Just tell the old man that--
Marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have done?
Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private lives should not be public property.
Randolph!
The Journal was pretty harsh to Roosevelt today.
Nothing for you to worry about, darling
Well -- he got us, didn't he? She stands and goes quickly to pour a drink. A forced laugh
I wanted it
That's right. You've captured me exactly. Goodnight.
I just want to understand--
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
I can't remember the lines!
Now, Orson, you know I'm just dyin' to see your picture and I know it's gonna be boffo, but you're writing about a publisher, right?
And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.
I don't know what you expected with Joseph- fucking-Conrad for Chrissake. I mean this is Hollywood, pal.
So, we've got to come up with our movie. Our biography.
How about Howard Hughes? We could do Hughes
Okay, boy wonder, what?
This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word to her.
Why her?
They don't have to.
Hearst looks down at the world at his feet Everything has always been beneath him.
It's good, huh?
Craig is one syllable
And I'm looking at them -- and they're all looking at me and I don't know who should pour the tea. '
Uh huh.
I want you back
Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.
Hey, kid. Gregg.
Me, I'm proud to be a Jew, I got no problem. You don't like it, fuck you. But with these guys it's like a dirty word. All they wanna be is good red- white-and-blue Americans, and the way they see it you can't be a good American and a Jew. So Sam Goldfish becomes Sam Goldwyn and David Selznick becomes David 0. Selznick -- like anyone's gonna think he's Irish for fuck's sake--
You gonna watch?
Thank you-
Thank you -- b-b-but I'd really like t-t-to--
Very generous
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
It's an awful title, of course, but I can't think of anything better. Someone came up with A SEA OF UPTURNED FACES -- which has a nice, grand ring to it -- and I thought of JOHN CITIZEN, USA but that strikes me as a bit Warner Brothers. Or, God forbid, Capraesque. I suppose AMERICAN will do for now but--
They've all seen a rough cut
How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--?!
This isn' t some kinda fucking game! You know how many people RKO employs?! You know how many people depend on what we do for a living?!
You know something, Orson, you haven't done anything but lie to me from the moment we met. But, ya know, I'd do it again in a second.
Let's go, Jake, wake up!
Tommy, thanks for coming over.
I'm Ok.
No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.
How can he embarrass you?
Now the fight's off the books altogether. Meyer Lansky couldn't get a bet down on this fight. Some people are saying you're going into the tank.
Believe what you want.
Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.
What do you mean?
Screw you, Jack.
Why didn't you tell me about it?
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
I did keep an eye...
Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't tellin' me the truth.
You just fought Sugar Ray two weeks ago and you're training like this right now... Are you afraid Sugar Ray might beat you this time?
You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for?
I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
I can't find my ball.
If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
Jake...
Well, he's popular. A lotta people like Janiro. You beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. But, what do I know? I should keep my mouth shut, I should...
Who asked you?
You're not interested in him?
No, I'm not.
Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
Vickie?... Vickie, you asleep?
Huh?
Yeah, what?
What did I say?
You know what I'm talking about. Don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight.
What'd you see?
I went to the movies.
Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
Talk some sense into him, will ya? You're still his brother. If he ain't gonna listen to you, he ain't gonna listen to nobody!
Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister in-law.
What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
This is Doyle's house.
From the looks of Davidson's cable, it might even go higher than that. And we haven't even got a camera over there.
Mrs. -- Thorwald's -- clothes. -- Clean -- carefully packed -- not too stylish -- but presentable.
Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.
I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.
Well, officer -- do your duty.
I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.
Thanks.
Jeff -- huh?
If possible -- both.
I mean when he goes out for a paper, or a drink, or something. What he doesn't know won't hurt him.
Give him evidence.
Did you ever own a saw?
Look Jeff, don't louse up my night with another man killer stuffing a grisly trunk that turns out to be --
In sections! And one other thing, doubting Tom -- it just occurred to me that all the calls Thorwald made were long distance! If he called his wife the day she left -- after she arrived in Merritsville -- why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived?
Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.
Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long.
For what?
I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
Like what?
Well -- did you get it, Thorwald?
Right now I'd even welcome trouble.
No.
She's just not the girl for me.
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
How did you know!
She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.
I'm just going to get the name of their truck!
There's a dip at this end. And since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks?
I wonder.
You can tell that from here?
You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
He knows.  Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.
It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
What a day I've had!
Don't laugh. -- I could do it!
I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
Three.
You mean "goodnight."
To get on home.
Someone not his wife?
Still -- those witnesses.
The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.
I'm not much on rear window ethics.
Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.
Do you like it?
But you're not?
Chelsea 2-5598.
Buzzie--we better get out of here.
Meaning me?
Yeah.
How'd he get in?
Hold it, Jim.
Mother--
What's that pounding?
Who's there?  Anyone there?
Yes, sir.
Do you know why you shot those puppies, John?  Is that what they call you or do you have a nickname?
Where did you get the gun?
Hi there.
You shouldn't monkey with him.
I'm here.
Jim--Do you think when the end of the world comes it'll be at night?
Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.
We know.
Hey where'd you go?
There's only one key.
I'm here.
I just have a feeling.  Where are you?
Just a guard.
I'm sorry.
'Bye, Mom.
No!  I don't want you to go to the police!  There were other people and why should you be the only one involved!
No!  You're not tearing me loose any more.
Hey!  That's enough static out of you.
Assault with a deadly weapon.
Hi.  I saw you before.
You don't have to be unfriendly.
Dig the square wardrobe!
Like even today.  I woke up this morning, you know?  And the sun was shining and everything was nice. Then the first thing that happens is I see you and I thought this is going to be one terrific day so you better live it up, boy, 'cause tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing.
Why'd you get mixed up with them? You don't have to prove anything.
I felt like it.
Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him.  He needed us.
What's he like?
Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere.
Shall I show you the nursery?  It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
Hi, Plato!
He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near there!
Are you and Mom home tonight?
I was talking to Dad.
A man of some travels.
I've been doing good, though.
Gotta be ten degrees out there.
I figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way --
Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I haven't gotten you anything --
You motherfucker.
Nick, please, it's me --
Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?
Nick...
Nick, what happened --
...Haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...
You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.
Nick, what are you talking about?
Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
I'm glad it was me.
Put him in the truck.
You're not Nick Mason...
Where's she work?
What's her middle name?
You knew the place --
Hell. Ten?
They won't recognize me.
At least gimme video poker.
A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain.
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
I want a map of that security level. Every room, every guard, every thing.
Six men means six guns.
No way.
I'm no threat without a gun.
We're aware of your position.
Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of the day you don't smoke?
Cancer-sucker.
That motherfucker --
This trucker? Met a girl in a bar one night, she didn't know his situation. He's drunk, she's drunk, they get to mackin' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it. His tongue. Sucks it right down.
Thanks, sister. How are ya.
...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum...
You want that for here or to go?
Here's my present to you, truck drivers --
DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!
Merlin, I didn't know --
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --
It's a roach, guy --
There are monsters...  ...in the gelatin...
We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do.
I'm just talking.
All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, and sit down for Christmas dinner. Watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.
Don't look like he missed the sunlight.
No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going.
Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD!
You're GONNA be there! We're getting outta here! TAKE IT!
NO!!!
She set them up. All of them.
Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas.
No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.
Where was she from, Compton?
Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem.
Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach. Give ya some cash, get that Scagnetti fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya.
The cops were there waitin' for us!
What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.
Say "hello" to a motherfucker who's inside. Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team?
Yeah.
Did the two of you talk?
What?
Tell me more about Cabot.
Because you paid for the breakfast, I'm gonna tip. Normally I wouldn't.
What do you care?
Give me my book.
No, she did it. She killed the cheatin' wife, too.
He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
He don't tip?  You don't tip? Why?
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
Why?
Just hold on buddy boy. Hold on, and wait for Joe. I can't do anything for you, but when Joe gets here, which should be anytime now, he'll be able to help you. We're just gonna sit here, and wait for Joe. Who are we waiting for?
No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? "Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin' grade.
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.
As opposed to good?
You really think we were set up?
What the fuck am I doing here? I felt funny about this job right off. As soon as I felt it I should said "No thank you", and walked. But I never fucking listen. Every time I ever got burned buying weed, I always knew the guy wasn't right. I just felt it. But I wanted to believe him. If he's not lyin' to me, and it really is Thai stick, then whoa baby. But it's never Thai stick. And I always said if I felt that way about a job, I'd walk. And I did, and I didn't, because of fuckin' money!
That's not correct.
Uh-uh, just cops.
That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy?
I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.
What do you think?
So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up.
Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.
Before you got here, Mr. Orange was askin' me to take him to a hospital. Now I don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead. He begged me to do it. I told him to hold off till Joe got here.
We had just gotten away from the cops. He just got shot. It was my fuckin' fault he got shot. He's a fuckin' bloody mess - he's screaming. I swear to god, I thought we was gonna die right then and there. I'm tryin' to comfort him, telling him not to worry, he's gonna be okay, I'm gonna take care of him. And he asked me what my name was. I mean, the man was dyin' in my arms. What the fuck was I supposed to tell him, "Sorry, I can't give out that information, it's against the rules. I don't trust you enough."? Maybe I shoulda, but I couldn't.
One question: Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from?
You should be. Maybe Lednov heard about that Sonora ranch of yours.
I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
Look of things, she doesn't.
But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
You can't leave us here.
Our kind of women?
Can we get a doctor at that ranch?
I'm sorry, but that's how it's got to be.
The who?
But the rest is right.
What?
Some of 'em you didn't mean but most of 'em you did. I don't blame you because I understand your way of thinking and why you think that way. You want your women on pedestals. But they have to be born on 'em -- they can fall off but they can't climb back up.
That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet?
I -- lost something.
That's right.
But it's leaded up and anyway a 22's no good for real huntin'. You shoot a man with a 22 and where are you?
How'd you happen to miss?
That's right, Steve.
Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...
I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.
Finished, son?
Half of them are mine.
That sure smells good.
I like it.
Suppose I take a look.
I tried my best, but these things take time.
We don't want to go there.
Clay Phillips.
Where is he?
We got to get movin'.
You're so nice.
Aren't we stayin'?
Then I know my alphabet.
Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
And you've got me all figured out?
For the last ten miles I've been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up. I'm getting to the point where I don't think there's any place named Sonora.
You stretch out. I'll fix something to eat.
Do I know you?
Ouch!!
Oh my God, the ghost has Buddy! Brenda do something!
Cindy, what's going on?
Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
He's right. I should go first.
Where's Shorty?
Sure. We can practice talking.
Buddy...
Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.
Great!!!
Better try a little higher.
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
There's something I really want to share with you.
No, I just heard the commotion, and when I got there I guess it was gone.
So, whatever happened to her?
But he'll kill her!
Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?
You could use the grade, huh?
Oh.
Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!
Did you do that?
Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?
Here you go, Professor.
As I am sure you are aware, Professor, subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of course, why I've given them special consideration.
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw.
Would you please focus?
That one.
Professor, we need to talk.
I can do it myself.
Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
You never could feel your legs.
Sit down and join us, Cindy.
Now you're being rude, Shorty.
Shorty, why don't you say grace?
This part removes the sense of humor.
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
Did you hear?
 I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
You said you hated him.
Just a little, please. Bad for the teeth.
You'd probably date him!  He's cu-uuute! Hey, Dad, did you ever see "Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer?"
I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin. What's the trouble, officer?
There you go. I love Bill Cosby pictures.
Why?
Bye, Birdie.  Chip, honey... I know it's hard being a teenager but I understand... I'm your mother and I love you.
Are you Chip Sutphin?
Home Sweet Home! Everything's fine, kids!
Hi, Hank.
You bring me such peace...
"P" as in...
Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
Who's voice was it, Dottie?
Objection! Argumentative!
Who is this?
So you do drink?
And who may I ask is Carl?
He killed people, Mom.
Just the damn cable TV company. You know how they are. Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle?
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
That was your People magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it?
Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
What is it, Betty?
Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
Yes. She bought my sister's business.
You think my sister is there?
Which room is it?
Yes.
You're not a dipsomaniac at your age?
You're a curious man. You're willing to jeopardize Jacqueline's life in order to satisfy your own curiosity.
How much does she want?
But tell me --
The tip is, anyhow. I like to work on your hair.
I ought to know.
What did she want?
He was a kind little man in his way  and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.
Oh, I'm making investigations.
You've never believed a word I told you about Mr. August.
Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things.
But I understand her. That may be more important.
Well?
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want - surrender herself to the police  stand trial  I don't think he knows.
Who are you?
I don't know.
I want you to see my room. I want you to see all of it.
I had begun to write again -that's whet I was doing when you came in.
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.
I saw you with her last week. I knew you'd be here tonight. Where is she?
Tell me where Jacqueline is - we've got to find her.
I think it's time.
Dr. Judd?
Would they hurt her?
It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.
There's nothing you can think of -- old letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?
If I were you, Mary -- I'd go back to school. I'd make no further attempt to find Jacqueline.
Why?
We don't know, Mary. We've been unable to get in touch with your sister.
I have written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi. She vouchsafes no information whatsoever.  It is six months since your tuition has been paid, Mary. Naturally, it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil.
You have only to stretch out your hand, take up the glass and drink a little.
False alarm.
You play an instrument?
Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
Oh, lots of reasons, most of them boring. But, up until I dropped out, John and I were... very much alike.
Sister older or younger?
Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm not saying I know people think you're a bitch, I'm saying I know what you mean. And I don't even know that people think you're a bitch. Do they?
Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?
What?
My therapist said that --
Aren't you?
Of course not.
No.
Everything about sex.
Like what?
To you?
I don't... why... why do you do this?
Why not?
I have money.
Tell me your name.
Ann Bishop Millaney.
No.
You're not like your sister. You couldn't be like her if you wanted to.
About who?
About me?
Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
No, you're not.
God, I m so mad at him!!
But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.
That's very flattering.
Yes.
I can't tell you like this.
I don't find this "turning the tables" thing very interesting --
Come on!!
Jesus Christ, Ann. Why is anybody anything? I think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad, and you don't allow for any gray areas, and that's what most of us consist of.
Graham...
Mmmmm...
Who'd you have lunch with?
Isn't therapy helping at all?
I want out of this marriage.
Yeah, so?
Did you masturbate?
I take it you've never masturbated?
So it was recently that you tried this.
I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
Do you want to leave therapy?
Not really.
Yes.
Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
What are you talking about?
Why not?
Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?
Listen to you!! You sound like Mom. What are you talking about?
He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?
Who are you?
I'm Cynthia Bishop.
I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
I, uh, know a guy at the power company.
Not exactly.
And you ask questions, right?
I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
How unfortunate. So when did you finally get to see a penis?
When I was fourteen.
What did he say?
Prettier than Ann?
Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?
Cynthia, I don't think you want to, I mean, you should see the way he dresses. I really think he's in a bad way.
Not today. I've got other plans.
Why not?
It just wasn't a smart thing to do. Did you sign any sort of paper, or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldn't broadcast these tapes?
You trust him.
Come on, John. You should be happy, we've gone this far without Ann finding out, I'm making it real easy on you. Just walk out of here and I'll see you at your house for a family dinner sometime.
Did he put you up to this?
No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all.
Not for three-fifty.
What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
Really. How'd it go?
I wish I didn't have to live someplace.
What the hell do you think? I love Ann. You think I'm going to tell her about Cynthia and hurt her feelings like that?
God, you need help.
Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.
He said immediately.
He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
Hi. Want a drink?
Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Sure.
And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?
Yeah.  Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...
OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower, Starliner Towers. May as well go there directly.
NIGHT NIGHT
BREAKING OUT
Check.  The quacks are willing tools?
I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
About Brad's family?
I've caught it once or twice.
Is it because I'm becoming too popular?
In a way...
I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
McKinley?...McKinley?
It's happened before.  Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?  He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.
Oh.  Ah, I'm not calling at an inconvenient moment am I?
Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
What are you trying to do?  Make Bert look like a fool?  He's made all the arrangements.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR COMPASSION
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
YOU'LL FIND A RAMBLING ROSE AND A PICKET FENCE
He was adopted you know.
Absolutely correct.
It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
Oh my poor baby.
They call it a new look at an old favourite I copied it from the 'Window on the World' show.  The Far East meets the Mid-West!
Why?
I've just come to tell you how fabulous I am.
I'm...happy.
Do you really think so?
Our speciality.
YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
Hey, Miles. Long time no see.
Glass or bottle?
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?
Good. How're you?
Hi.
No, I'm an actor.
Don't open that now. It's warm.
Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
How old's she going to be?
You know what? Let's take the Santa Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.
Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells.
So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?
Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
This is rose, right?
First take your glass and examine the wine against the light. You're looking at color and clarity.
Are you chewing gum?
So what's the plan today?
Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked.
Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it all going on.
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
Pull yourself together, man.
Shut up. Shut your face.
Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty nasty nasty.
Later.
Does she know about Saturday?
Look who's talking. You've been there.
What? Of course I like Christine.
She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you.
Huh.
We're on.
Let me use your phone.
See? Right there. Just what you just said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint on a skyscraper. I couldn't write that.
I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.
Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
Yep. Quite a day.
I'm fine. You rest.
What the fuck!
Hey.
Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read.
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
So what's your novel about?
A paper?
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
Well, nice to see you now.
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
So what's happening with your book?
I told you I need a drink.
Cabernet Franc.  This is only the fifth year we've made this varietal. Very few wineries around here do a straight Cabernet Franc. It's from our vineyard up in Santa Maria. And it was a Silver Medal winner at Paso Robles last year.
That was fun last night.
Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.
No.
See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get obsessed.  I'm letting go now.
Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill?
I got the bat at home... On the wall.
Explain, act crazy?
Pharmacy crowded?
How can you say that?
They caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. They found the bird. His head crushed in. When you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.  They think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion.
This is going to do nothing.
They're distracting us?
They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates.  But we held strong.
Yes.
We might lose the signal.
I'm getting out now.
Oh.
Dad.
They'll read our minds!
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.
Some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world.  Nothing really bad is going to happen, is it Uncle Merrill?
Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.
Well, Kate, it was self-defense sure enough, but I think you'd have to say I killed old Murdo. I think that's definitely the word.
Emmett.
Forget it.
I'd be worse if you hadn't come along.
I almost didn't.
McKendrick's men got him.
I'm surprised to see you out here tonight.
Are you all right?
No, Leavenworth.
Looks like that's not all they admired.
What's Turley like?
It's not going to be easy.
They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
There are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren't them.  Are these your friends?
Came to the wrong town. I don't tolerate this kind of thing. It's hard on the peace, and it's hard on the furniture. Now, knowing a bit about Carter here, I'm going to let you go without paying for the damages. But go you will, and I mean now.
You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.
The jury saw it differently.
I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay.
Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.  The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
I got there just short of too late.
He must be pretty good.
Things are getting messy around here.  I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.
Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it.
This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think I finally found my place in the world.
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would have picked.
Nah!  What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it?  Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.
I want to reassure you, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and I.
Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
God, Viktor.  Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
We can hardly make a profit with them.  Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine. We're at their mercy.  We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date.  When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!
-- It's called a projector.
I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?
Not today.  She's learning her lines.  You can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget.
Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.  I'm worried about you, that's all.  This woman -- she controls your destiny.
That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?
Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?
Viktor, do you realize you always do that?
I was thinking -- what about you and... "Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey?
Don't look so glum, Viktor.  It's not a death sentence.
Yes -- oh my, God.  Is that you, Simone?!  I've been wanting to talk to you.
Where are you?
Of course.  What are you suggesting?
You understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the, er...  ... scent.
Simone?
"Why are we here?  Is that what you're asking, Jack?... Why are we here?  No why.  Just here".
Who are you really?
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
For her?
Hal, what are you doing?
Why not?
-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
How did the wall get there?
Is she here?
-- We call them "vactors".
What's that?
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
I'm going to finish the picture, sweetheart.  It's important.
I missed you.  I wondered if you were ever coming back.
She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did you find her?
I know plenty of boys.
-- I know, I don't know anything.
So that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six?
Dad, you know I don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now.  She broke up with Kent.
-- I can't accept it.  I don't want a car, Dad.
I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!
This is the story.
The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
What is it exactly you want, Sayer?
You love her, don't you, Max?
Is it a jamming device?
Long live the First Amendment.
Taller, Viktor.
Thank you.
The only real truth is in the work.
Why, Malcolm?
Goodnight, Malcolm.
I don't tell her a thing.
Dr. Crowe.
Yes.
Did you think the play sucked big time?
I have to.
You really look better.
Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... And then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. No one asked them. It's just gone...
Don't go home, okay?
Don't get mad.
You know that accident up there?
A lady. She died.
You can see her?
They?
Dead people.
...I don't know.
Cole, this was a legal courthouse. Laws were passed here. Some of the first laws of this country. This building was full of lawyers. Lawmakers.
I don't know how else to look--
...He doesn't get invited places.
You ever hear of... the harvest of blood?
What's a "little while?"
Yo. "Billy Bob". Was I two beats behind, or what?
Listen to me, you banjo-dueling, country ass hayseed... I want my Nikes and I want them now!
Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us?
Bitch.
Someone actually... employs you?
You have a strong unfufilled desire.
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
Well, there goes our record deal.
I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
Are you crazy?
So... what does it do?
"Old Macdonald... had --"
Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
That old barn. After the fire... I rebuilt it nail by nail. Just the way your granddaddy would've wanted it.
Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.
-- And keep your eyes on the road.
About what?
Then why go back now?
How'd you get that? Playing with your pitchfork?
You wouldn't understand.
No --
Mac... let's get out of here.
...no... Mac... p-please...
Carl.
It gets worse. He's cut all the phone lines.
Shit.
Pretty, ain't they?
We'll just head up here into Bishopville, get checked up in the hospital. Then maybe we'll head off to Hollywood after all, huh?
And then we get here, the Castavets', where last night's shit--storm took place.
He's a fucking Martian?!
My sister Megan, she's a big fat cow. Was then, even more so now. I'd be thinking, what'd you see in her ain't in me?
How much style?
Okay. I was in Texas dancing in an industrial show for Sunkist Oranges. They say I'm the new Anita Bryant. But I'm really a dancer from New York. A lot of credits. Moderate talent.  Anyway, after opening night, I was walking back to the motor lodge and suddenly there he was. A tall Texan with a twenty-nine inch waist. Pure dynamite.
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
Why? You have a bowling date?
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
Driving, talking to me...
Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.
Seriously?!?
What the hell's going on?
Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time.  Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.
Jesus!!!
Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
-- Trucking ain't the easiest life in the world. I mean, you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know?
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
-- Actually, my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named Ramblin' Bobby Holt. When I turned twenty- one, I went to Europe with visions of being free and independent. My luck, he was on the plane. I landed in Paris and fell in love before I could claim my baggage.  We were together for almost a year. I thought he was it.
I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
No.
See.
I don't know, man. Ask him?
Loud and clear.
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
You're coming up to the scale house.
Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice.
What's your twenty and what's your handle?
Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy?
It ain't ever been done before, hot shit.
Uh-uh. What Cobra?
This is Bandit I. Over.
Oh.
That crazy sumbitch made it.
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
That's correct.
Right now? A six man security force, plus a member of our Butler staff. So seven men total.
C'mon Bill... you've got some Sultan up there, one of your whales, big- spender, likes a lot of space, you cook up this "construction" thing...?
I tell you, engineering this kind of play against Sparazza, going to the lengths these guys are going to... they're playing some long odds.
What about the sheriff's task force?
Deputy, have you made any ID's?
Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
-- run both those names through the D.C. database. Call San Francisco, see if they've got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for --
Two of 'em?
...I forgive you Darwin.
What'd you say?
Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
And I vibe that kiddo, I do indeed, but it's one'a those fait accompli things, you have to --
You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
...A paternity suit, filed 1967...
Okay, he's gonna clip Israel, I just gotta outta there --
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
Shoot.
Good. This thing's on track, looks like it's gonna get done.
-- never in a million girl --
I probably woulda busted on you too... and what a shame that woulda been.
I'm not givin' it up jus' yet...
I DON'T KNOW!
You're not Gibarian...
I want to hear your version.
Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
He'll let me in.
Why, who did you see?
And professionally?
Rheya.
What's wrong with you?  We need your help.
And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening.  Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on?  Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
Is it a planet?
I would have these -- I don't know how to describe them -- visions, when I was younger.  Maybe not visions, but like these waking dream states.  Time would just collapse, I would be inside time.  I would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped.  Freaky stuff.
What happened to us, exactly?
Sartorius.
I'm sure there are worse people to talk to, but I don't know who they are.
Gibarian.  He was here.
It's all right.
I'm not Rheya.  You've always known that.
Rheya, I am not going back.  I'm staying here with you.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
Chris --
Yes, you are --
Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?
I have consciousness, but I am not mortal.  Don't you see why I'm going crazy?
How can you be here...
He won't do it.
Gibarian was under enormous --
Snow, get up here, now.
You didn't like him?
Occasionally.
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
What did he say?
No dog.
No dog.
Tell it like it is.
Good night, Mike.
They called here after you left...
Not exactly.
What do you want to do?
I don't know...
Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came.
You're planning to speak?
My ass if falling.
What are you talking about?
I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.
No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?
Bought it.
She bought it.
Coming to bed?
What?
I don't know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it.
They're operating on him.  He's still alive.
I heard a lot... Anything you want to deny, Mike?
Hey Mike, out of the bag into the bureau, huh... How do you like it so far?
Do it, or look for another profession.  That's a choice I guess.
I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so.
What're we having?
Cause if you get in a bind--
Yeah, ya like to do things on your own  I been thinkin' lately.  Maybe I wasn't the, ya know, greatest dad--
I was there.
"Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times."
Great idea.  Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home.
You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.
How are you doing, kid?
Yeah--
I bet you don't think I appreciate you, Parker.  I do.
I got a question, college boy.  What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?  I ask for disaster, pathos, what do I get?  Salvador Dali!  When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, I'll ask for--
I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
No! Washington Square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs.  Did you get pictures?
Oh, that?  It'll come unstuck in a half-hour or so. Your mouth needs the rest.  Bye.
You're making my life difficult.
No.  I was lying about the coffee.
He'll weasel out of trouble. Again.
What are you doing this weekend?
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
Hello.  Earth to Peter.  Are you listening?
You sure about all this?
Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
Aunt May, what happened?
Is this some sort of Zen thing?
Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
Your dog ate it.
Actually, I got this spider bite
Why? It is a wrestling match, or
No.  No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call.
And blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  Bit egotistical, isn't it?
A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In  his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely.
Spider-Man, be careful!  He's quite mad.
Is you all little Adolfs?
Jawohl!
We made a deal with Barrack One.
Any news on Dunbar?
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
Come on, Trader Horn! Let's hear it: what'd you give the Krauts for that egg?
Nice guy! The Krauts shoot Manfredi and Johnson last night and today he's out trading with them.
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
I grease the Kraut guards. With ten percent of the take.
And maybe a little something else?
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
That's the general idea.  Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.
I am Lieutenant Dunbar.
What is your number?
I'll live.
Say, Schulz --
When you get going on those broads, think of me!
Good morning, Animal! What'll it be for breakfast? Scrambled eggs with little sausages? Bacon and eggs sunny- side up? Griddle cakes? A waffle?
I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.
Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go!
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
You'll fix me up!
I've been crazy about you for years. I've seen every picture you've ever made six times. I'd just sit there and never even open that popcorn bag.
Not yet.
Cut the horseplay, Harry. What's the matter with you guys?
Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
We've all done a poor job of it.
What's it add up to you, Sefton?
Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud. He'll draw every light from every goon tower. It's our only chance to cut through. What do you say, Barracks' Chief?
You could use a new one yourself.
Give this to Joey, will you?
They're lying dead in the mud out there and I'm trying to find out how come.
So was the radio private property. So was Manfredi and Johnson.
Or how about a game of pinochle? No, you're not a pinochle man. You're a chess player.  I haven't played since I was a kid. Let's see --  -- a pawn moves this way, doesn't it? And a bishop this way? And the queen -- every which way, doesn't it?
We have no radio.
Wunderbar! Maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife. But there is a piano teacher in the village --
I'll make it five hundred!
Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
It's working.
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
Courage is an emotion too, Data.  Now, can you project the course of the ribbon?
Is she still angry?
Data, are you all right?
Looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while. How do you feel?
It took a long time, but eventually I learned to live with it. And I began to realize that my experience in the Nexus had changed me.  I knew things about people, about events, about time.
Left behind?
Why would you want to leave?
I know exactly where I want to go, and when. Back to that mountaintop on Veridian III, before Soran put out the star. I have to stop him.
You said history considers me dead. Who am I to argue with history?
I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
I thought you might.
I don't want a science lecture. You were on that observatory looking for trilithium. Why?
No, I didn't know that.
Counselor. What can I do for you?
As ship's counselor, it's your duty to know not only when you're needed but also when you're not.
Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now.
My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
The royal...studs?
Sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago.
It is a Class D-12 Bird of Prey. They were retired from service because of defective plasma coils.
As their cloak begins to engage, their shields will drop.
Enterprise maintaining full impulse power...
Tractor beam, aye!
Put me on the hailing frequency.
Unit two, this is One. The Kobayashi Maru has set sail for the promised land. Acknowledge.
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?
Hello, sir. It's David.
As before... Metallic mass... Verifying triminium photon tube... No new data.
Saavik... My god, what happened to them?
It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
So, like your father, you changed the rules...
Whoever they are, they're getting closer.
If equipment is functioning properly, indications are -- an animal life form.
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now.
Yes. And I know you.
... Admiral, what's going to happen to Enterprise?
Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours, present speed.
No, sir, no response.
Would you look at that?
Genesis?! Whatever for?
Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
Yours...?!
No.
... He spoke of your friendship.
But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
Please wait!... Surely he would have found a way! If there was so much at stake -- Spock would have found a way!
1,000 Kellicams, closing!
Sir, may I --
Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create --
Wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship?
For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.
Bones, I don't want to be lectured.
Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
It never rains but when it pours --
Do you have anything to eat? I don't know about anyone else, but I'm starved.
Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority...
Does that about do it?
I've tried to warn you. Scientists are always pawns of the military --
Are you sure these are the coordinates?
<u>Botany Bay</u> -- oh no!
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
Well done, Commander.
Why didn't you tell me?
It's a long story.
We'll beam aboard and stop it --
You knew enough to tell Saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life --
It was just words.
Don't you believe it.
Let them eat static.
Well?
Yours... is... the superior...
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he...  ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the <u>Enterprise</u> picked up the <u>Botany Bay</u>, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
Scotty -- what's left?
Give the word, Admiral.
Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power.
Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report, Spock?
Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days.
Hrummm... and where are you off to, now?
Permission to come aboard, Captain?
There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond.
Visual!  Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --
You've got to learn WHY things work on a Starship.  It's coming through now, Khan...
Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott.
Estimating nebula penetration in two minutes. Reliant is closing.
Uhura! What's happening? Damn it...
Captain Spock, if you do not hear from us within <u>one hour</u> your orders are to restore what power you can, take the Enterprise to the nearest Star Base and alert Starfleet command when you are out of jamming range.
Very well.
How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?
I failed to resolve the situation.
That was a little joke.
Khan!
Yes, well, why don't you show him around and...
Mr. Sulu... The shields!
Shields activated!
We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
Fire all phasers...!
Lieutenant, how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?
I do not understand the final question...
How're you doing?
No!  No... What did you have in mind...?
Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine.  I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
You're joking...!
10 million years earlier. Humpbacks were heavily hunted by Man. They have been extinct since the 21st Century... It is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact.
... It gives me a great sense of history.
All right, Commander, you wanna tell us anything?
I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you.
We are in an enemy wessel, sir. I didn't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral.
Back to San Francisco.
Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
Go ahead.
We can't tell you.  Please, just -- let me finish. I can tell you that we're not in the military and that we intend no harm to the whales.
In fact, we may be able to help -- in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine.
Just a little joke. See you later, old friend.
... You're very perceptive.
All right. The truth?
Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
I bet you're a damn good poker player.
If we keep going up, they'll catch us!
... What does that mean?
I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
Why does it have to be goodbye?
The late 20th Century.
What are the variables...?
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
The tank will be finished by morning...
10,000 M.S.L., Admiral.
Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
Sir -- I've got some back pressure on manual --
Then, this is what it would sound like underwater?
Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
Estimate range, ship to whales!
Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
They're giving out. De-crystallizing.
I'm ready Spock. Let's go find George and Gracie...
Genesis was perfectly named: The creation of life not death. It was the Klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets.
We deny nothing! We have the right to preserve our race!
Don't know anything about it? I find it difficult to believe that I've come millions of miles --
That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.
Just use the keyboard...
I will be returning to Vulcan within the hour... I wanted to take my leave of you.
It is not an effort. You are my son.  Besides; I am most impressed with your performance in this -- crises.
There are days.
Mother and son. You arranged this...?
Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?
You're what?
I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.
No one's ever asked me that before.
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
You're not going to launch anything until...
You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...
I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...
... and because they have warp capabilities, the consequences to their society are minimal...
On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...
With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve...  I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?
It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would?
They're following the kelbonite deposits... using the interference to block our transporters...
There is an alternative to an all- out assault. Isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to them.
I want our guests to depart as quickly a etiquette allows. I'll ask Worf to delay his return to DS9 so he can join us. We're going to stop by sector four-four- one on our way to the Goren system.
Do you know how they were damaged?
I don't believe it happened that way.
In a sense, that's all he knew. The system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss.
Options?
The purpose being I intend to shove it down the Son'a's throat.
You've not aged a day since then?
Worf to Picard...
We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
Sir, if we fire a tachyon burst, it may force him to reset his shield harmonics. When he does, we could beam him out...
Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...
No, sir...
Counselor?
Why was Data assigned?
I don't see anything to suggest the Son'a have any interest in sociology...
Sir, I am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels...
Yes...
I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
I wish to... go back to the way I was.
Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
I am... grateful for what you have given me. But I still do not wish to be assimilated.
The vortex is collapsing, sir.
How serious is the damage?
I'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below.
Always am.
We can't leave her out there. When the ship launches... she'll be killed.
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
Altitude fifty kilometers...
Entering the upper ionospere...
No... but sometimes I feel that way.  What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs.
We?
A key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like.
Life signs?
Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.
They're bypassing Engineering...
Captain, they're firing at a nuclear missile silo... in central Montana.
Good luck, Captain.
You may need assistance, doctor...
Or not to be -
We're not finished.
Bones, are you afraid of the future?
Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
We're explorers not diplomats!
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
We were until your torpedoes!
They'll make it look like an accident...
They'll respect him now...
My God, what happened here?
And you still maintain your ship did not fire on Kronos One? Would you have known if she had? Come now, Captain. The record clearly there were no other ships in the sector.
And what did they tell you?
Louder, please. We cannot hear you.
Well, I -
Where is Mr. Sulu?
Get close enough to a man and you can kill him on "Stun" without setting off the alarm - of course you can't get rid of the body...
Aye, sir.
Do we report this, sir?
We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
What took you so long?
Except us.
Possibly.
The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
I am uncertain.
Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
Not as yet, sir.
We've been ordered to -
Sorry to wake you, sir, but Starfleet urgently requests any data we may have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
That could take hours!
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
What exactly does that mean?
You understand that we have lost all contact with Captain Kirk...?
I don't think Starfleet could have envisioned our current predicament.
Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?
Beverly, come in.
Jean Luc, Whatever you were... Right now you're the man you've made yourself. He's someone else.
The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you.
But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
Reminds me of a young doctor I used to know...
I understand why it would seem confusing. Certain human rituals... like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time.
And this makes you "sad"?
They are trying to override the access codes. Reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and...
We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
Of you?
He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin
We are passing through the Bassen Rift. The projections will return when we have cleared it.
We are losing dorsal shields.
Well, he seems to have the same internal mechanics as Data but not as much positronic develop- ment.  The neural pathways aren't nearly as sophisticated. Id say he's a prototype. Something Dr. Soong created before Data .
The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... Im a talking head.
And you needn't worry. I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know.
Do you have a moment, sir?
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.

What do we know about the planet?
Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.
Geordi, put 211 power to the engines.  Take it from life support if you have to -- everything you can give me.
Deanna, on my mark.
How long until he can fire?
Understood.
So, human... you've met your better self!
He wasn't designed to live a complete, human life span.
Strength in numbers?
Anything.
I am, Commander Riker...  May I touch your hair?
Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... youd be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would.
After you, Praetor.
Maybe I'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does.  Or maybe Ill snap its ugly head off.
And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.
The man who is Jean Luc Picard and Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! He is better than that!
So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?
That's your life... not mine.
You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
Report!
Our greater goal is more important, brother.
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
Praetor...
They will obey, Praetor.
The Scimitar will serve my needs.
I don't think so... 
Gate three. It's boarding now.
You have one with two beds?
Fill this out.  Will this be cash or credit card?
Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money.
Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.
It's in a green Mustang?
Why did you let it get into a populated area?
It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed...
I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time.
You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now.
Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book.
What?
Ah... no...
What?
I am Jenny Haydn.
Space?
Sun...
That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't...
A baby is a new person?
What?
A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
I like this music.
That was beautiful.
No. Get in.
I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
May I have twenty-five cents, please?
Where do you think you're going?
Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
After I called in, I had a chance to sit down with the three locals. They swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... It might be alive.
Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
It was a man though... right?
Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living?
I told you...
Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
Superconducting QUantum Interference Device.  SQUID.  Got it?  There's gonna be a test.
You can't just... kill him.
I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
How did it happen?  What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?
So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
You think Tran killed her?
The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public?
That's not sayin' much.
You were lucky, Max.
Naw.  She won't call me.
But this is a bad one.
Top ten.
Looks like she was holding out.
Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.
He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.
All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes.  I've heard stuff.
Okay... what about Strickland?
Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her.
Where's Faith?
Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody.  It's too perfect.
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
What?
Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
What clip?  What was it?
I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
Your sex life?
Greetings, gents.  So let's hear this week's sad story.
Yeah, but that was for love.
What the fuck are you doing?
Are we having a bad night?
Jesus, Lenny.
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
No it doesn't.
Where we going?
Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my throat.  In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?!
So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy new year, Lenny.
Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
It was a tough call.
The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow...
Got your ticket?
Alright.  We're going up.
And do what?  Take on his whole posse?
Then we'll be right where we are now.
Are we under arrest?
Hey, Lenny.  We made it.
Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.
Just Lenny.
No.  I haven't noticed because I make my payments.  So, Max Pelcher, how's the P.I. business?
Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
Testa?
Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?
Agent Duncan, there's an interstate issue up on 54, run out there.
Anybody talk to the press?
Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there, no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?
You have the body?
You... surprised me.
You must travel a lot, huh?
About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
There was a car in the lot when we closed. Gone today.
What are you doing?
Mackelway, I could understand. He is over-emotional by nature, but you, Agent Kulok, you had a shining career in front of you.
The cut on your arm -- mind if we remove the bandage?
We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated, it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We, the Director and I, decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero.
We're waiting for trace evidence results on the Rice killing.
We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.
Watch out for Dick Low, he's a liar; he has his own world. There was a Junior Agent in Seattle, not unlike you, an Agent who fell under Dick's spell. He'd have done anything for Agent Low. Richard got this Agent to take a suspect to the crime scene, beat him up, force a confession -- all unauthorized, all illegal.  The Agent died that night, killed by the suspect. Richard Low got him killed. Worst of all, we had to hush it up, let the suspect go. The suspect was George Sheldon, the second man Richard killed.
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
Thanks for the ride.
The Academy, then CIIAC.
How long have you been downtown?
Doesn't fit.
That information's being withheld from the media.
Yes I do.
I was interested in two things: computers and crime. They sort of came together.
Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
I ever get like that, just take me out in back and shoot me.
What did you tell him?
Just routine stuff.
No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
Not the way I can.
Jaime? Where are you?
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
That's a crackpot theory. Everybody says so.
You're putting me in a difficult position.
I haven't changed anything.  Damn.
Unlock these cuffs.
He's moved on to TV.
I don't carry it with me.
Who told you about her?
You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.
[The address is 147 South Rane. It's a lively address. You got a problem with dark meat?]
[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
I screwed up twice, sir.
Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the "item" screams, she chokes. He had a thing about eyes, always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick.
Locate a jet, we're going to Amarillo.
He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you.
Shit.
I know, I know.
Moving here from New York was much more of an adjustment than this.
It didn't feel that way.
Well, you know, it's tough. A lot of traveling. A lot of hotels... but, you know, it's a dream... and the money's really good. I think I might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in Vegas...
Are you sure? Maybe...
I like quiche.
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single.
...and boy does it hurt when they ask.
I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy".
Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it.
Sorry?
If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it.  Can I have one of these?
...Six months.
Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
But you said I shouldn't call if I wanted to give up on her.
It sucks.
Unless she comes back first.
I didn't want to say anything.
I don't know. It's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter.
I don't talk about her that much.
Sounds more like Aids...
I just tested for one...
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
You haven't been drinking, have you?
...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
Not well.
What are they doing here?
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Mike?
Don't call me ever again.
I don't know...
I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment.
We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? It makes me want to puke.
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
When?
Whu?
Tee, the beautiful babies don't work Wednesdays midnight to six. This is the skank shift.
That's not cool.
Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
You think so?
I'm too tired for this. Let's just go.
Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.
It's just that I've been out of the game so long. Trent, I was with her for six years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know...
Baby, you did fine.
...Baby...
"Big Brother", "Little Brother"?
What?
She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done? Lie?
Christy was nice...
I don't know. The whole Judy Garland thing kind of turned me on. Does that makes me some kind of fag?
Baby, you take yourself out of the game. You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip.
That was different.
...a day...
Selling scrap metal.
No.
It's not like that...
Don't give me that! She liked you, man.
Bitch... You little bitch!
What a surprise...
Now?
You are so money, and you don't even know it...
You're like this big bear with claws and fangs...
...Yeah. You're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared...
...and fangs... and you're like "I don't know what to do. How do I kill this bunny?"...
You're money.
...Shut up, Sue...
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
What do you want of me?  I'll give you anything you want, but do what I ask!
The Court gave you justice.
You never think to protect yourself with real friends.  You think it's enough to be an American.  All right, the Police protects you, there are Courts of Law, so you don't need a friend like me. But now you come to me and say Don Corleone, you must give me justice. And you don't ask in respect or friendship.  And you don't think to call me Godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder...for money.
Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
You're staying home.  You're not going out.
Clemenza.  You take care of Paulie. I don't ever want to see him again. Understood?
My compliments.  I'll take care of them from my share.
He's his own boss, and very competent.
Should I bring him in.
When does my daughter leave with her bridegroom?
Barzini.
He was the one behind Sollozzo?
For killing a man.
And now, what do you choose to do?
I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.
I'll need him.
How?
You tell us about America.
Hey America!  Is she as rich as they say?
Mike!  The party starting!
That's for you to find out.
We're all tired...
The other families won't sit still for all out war.
You start operating, the five families will start their raids again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money.
Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
Kay, we weren't expecting you.  You should call...
You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss.  Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork!
My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...
I never know when you're telling me the truth.
And what do you want for Christmas?
Hello.  Kay?
Huh?
I can't...
I don't think so either.  I better go.
Tell me!
I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father.  What happened to the detectives who were guarding him?
Good.  She's been through it before. Me too.  You were too young to know about it.  You better wait outside; there're some things you shouldn't hear.
I can help you out...
All right, Mikey...who do we have to hit, Clemenza or Paulie?
I know I'm not the man he was.  But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.  When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
Where are you going?
Send some bodyguards.
What is it?
Do you renounce Satan.
Barzini's people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it.  Pretty soon there won't be one place in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.
Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better.
You're unlucky.
You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.
You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie?
It's vile.
No, I like him.
Marge, you like everybody.
I had to promise, capital P, never to take it off -- otherwise I'd give it to you.
Dubious but special honor, Tom -- crewing Dickie's boat. Alright, bar's open.
Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
What?
I have to go to Venice.
A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
Your handwriting -- nothing more naked. See -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity.
Do you have any brothers?
Shoes too?
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do you know what that means in a place like this?
I'm prepared to take the blame.
I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
Ripley's plans.
Why?
Really? To Italy?
Marge and I are getting married.
How?
What?
What evening?
Frederico!
This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.
Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks.
He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you.
No. No, I'm staying here for a few days, in Rome. That's a new piano, so you prob --
Hardly.
Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello.
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
Is Mr Greenleaf here?
Mr Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty. He really does. Marge, she's got a hundred theories, but there are a few things she doesn't know. We hope she never knows.
I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me?
Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
Very.
I found Dickie's rings.
You've got Dickie's rings.
I told you. He gave them to me.
What?
I told you! I knew it!
What's funny?
Which is?
But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you?
Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's.
I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?
A ragione. A ragione. 
Questa lettera e stata trovata nell'abitazione del signor Richard Greenleaf a Roma.
Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?
Ten thirty?
But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody...
Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do.
You try. You try talking to her.
Ask me what I want to change about this moment.
What do you want to change about this moment?
I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's my, that's my -- terrible and alone and dark -- and I've lied about who I am, and where I am, and so nobody can ever find me.
Senta. We have to ask you to stay in Rome.
So, the Doctor, he has to make the --  -- come se dice?
What about Thomas Ripley?
November, I thought.
Thank you.
I think I just said. Ripley was handling some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me. Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him. And when.
Absolutely.
Yes?
I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
Huh?
Damn.
You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.
No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when --
Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic.
We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
That's fine.
Well, you ever need one, I know a feller that kin getcha a real nice deal. Lotsa shit around.
Well, if there's this many hackies inside, there must be lots of fares outside. And I'm gonna hustle 'em.
I have.
Why you hang around with them greasers?
That's a nice name.
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
You can do it in my mouth.
Do you understand why I came here?
But that one night?
No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
But you can't live like this. It's hell. Girls should live at home.
Huh?
What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from...
I... I don't get along with people like that.
Do I look like a narc?
What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard?
Cops don't do nothin.
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
I'll give you the money to go. I don't want you to take any from those guys.
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
Have you tried the telephone?
There must be something...
Some. Here and there.
My name is Henry Krinkle -- that's with a "K." K-R-I-N-K-L-E. I live at 13 1/2 Hopper Avenue, Fair Lawn, New Jersey. Zip code 07410.  Got that?
Your name Sport?
Well, if you are, it's entrapment already.
So howsit?
I'm a field agent.
Hi.
The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
What about you, Delly?
Not exactly light reading, I know. Believe it or not, I've read this since high school, and it got me all the way through law school. Besides, there's something in there that'll help you.  You won't have to get very far, it's near the beginning.
Well...
... including me.  Right?  
You look... different.
You first.
It doesn't seem right, this being down here.  It ought to be where people can see it.
No, you are.  I know exactly what you mean.  It's not that you're missing something.  It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along.
Nothing.  
Now, did you remember that, or...
What... do you remember?
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... "accident," Mr. Appleton.  An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures.  Tell us, this "accident" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory?
Yes... yes, I do.
All right, Mr. Appleton.  That was what you knew then.  What do you know now?
Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party?
I'm not refuting anything.
The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
Mr. Appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the United States Congress. Believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath.
Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?
I... I need a drink of water.
Only one in town.  Get in, son.
No wallet, huh?
Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here.  Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory.
Yes.
But what?
Or the Bijou.  Either one.
Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town.
Exactly how long has the Bijou been closed?
Who... are they?
Yes?
Yeah, I know, but poultry...?
Ernie.
Yes?
Beautiful, wasn't it?
Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left.  Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact...
Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.
I guess I did.
It's a pretty massive heart attack. His lungs have filled with fluid, and, well... it seems as though his body is just... shutting down.
Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place.  Now, I need a moment alone.
So, it is a blacklist.
Don't say that.  There is no such thing as a blacklist.  Now, are you gonna play ball?
That's not the country Luke fought for.
Not at all.
Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
Well, that's not what they think.
No, I...
Please, sit.
They all know you?
How do you like our little hamlet?
I despise it.
Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
San Francisco.
And what had you done?
I don't understand.
So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
You get straight to the point, don't you?
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
I did.
Look.
Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
Mitch likes it very much. He comes up every weekend, you know, even though he has his own apartment in the city. He says San Francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge.
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
I don't know, honey.
Morning.
Do you know him?
Yes, but where?
See them two big trees across there?
I see. How do I get down there?
Why not, Mrs. Bundy?
I had a man trip and fall in the parking lot once, sued me before I could bat an eyelash.
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
I'm simply quoting the law.
She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch?
Yes, very.
I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to...
Tell him about the party.
Where will we go?
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
I miss him.  You know, sometimes I wake up in the morning, and I think 'I have to make Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get up and there's a... a very good reason for getting out of bed until... until, of course, I remember.  I miss talking to him.  Cathy's a child, you know, and Mitch...  ...Mitch has his own life.  I'm glad he stayed here today. I feel safer with him here. 
I don't mind, really.
That's the last of it.
That's a chimney swift, all right.
Didn't know how he got in there. Had a broken leg, turned out. Just fluttering all around there. 
Well, if there's anything else I can do, Mitch...
He won't be back until Monday. I mean, if those birds are for him....
Monday?
Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.
What?
Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?
These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
Do you have a pair that are just friendly?
I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
That was the damndest thing I ever saw.
That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay?
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
What for?
Yes.
Why would I want to see you, of all people?
What did it say?
But you were coming up anyway, remember?
Right next to the one you already had.
Certainly, but...
Famished.
Will I be seeing you again?
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
It all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills, a malcontent. He went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings weren't fit to rule this planet, preaching wherever anyone would listen...
And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!
What do you mean?
I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy?
The town looks clear.
What time is it?
The power.
Mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement...
Yes.  Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock.  Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
For what purpose?
No one ever said you were, Mitch.
Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
Not if they're starting a war.
I fear he may have to.
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
Ask this one favor --
It's not because of Georgina -- because of Dr. MacFarlane's failure?
I heard my parents speak of it in Thrums. It was a famous case.
Where can I find him?
You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
But I -- well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh and told her.
But you did promise.
I can't believe that.
She's unconscious.
Glencorse -- that's a lonely cemetery, Fettes, not a soul around for miles.
You've no thought of going there?
No.
Why, yes.
Don't you want to find the white horse, Georgina?  You can't find him from a wheelchair.  You have to walk and run to find him.
You'll not need that again, Georgina.
They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.
Afraid of what?
I am the best man for the job.
No.
You know something about the human body, Gray.
You can't build life like you put together blocks, Toddy.
What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
What are you going here? Have I not told you --
Wait, Toddy. That's not hospitable. I want to discuss business.
Gray, I must rid myself of you -- you've become a cancer -- a malignant, evil cancer -- rotting my mind.
I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
Was that it? Well, ok.
You think I'm crazy.
Leonard, Dutton, Erlich. They don't matter. I want the King.
Fuck! What do you want?
I don't know you, man.
What did they give you?
We're going to play a little game called "Who's got the Scar."
You killed that cop Dutton.
No! Why are you haunting me?
... it connects you to me...
Cause if you're losing your mind, I got a right to know.
I do. Every day.
Anything wrong?
Look, can I just call a cab?
Why are there so many?
They killed her because she found out.
I would never hurt you or Lauren. Never. Believe me.
In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people--  We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power.
If you mean that you are afraid of us--
I leave that in your hands.
What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police?
Such power exists?
Yes -- of course.
Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
Maybe a little demonstration.
Of course, dear.
Now think back hard. You didn't follow Mr. Carpenter at all, did you? You haven't even been out of the house.
Yes, I have!
Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.
Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world.
Did all these people die in wars?
No foolin'? Will you?
I've got some money. My mother gave me two dollars.
Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.
The skeletal structure is completely normal.  Same for the major organs - heart, liver, spleen, kidneys.
He told me this morning when I examined him. He's seventy-eight.
I'm sure I don't have to point out that your arrival was something of a surprise.  Had you been traveling long?
About five months -- your months.
Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from.
It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.
I mean the reasons for my coming here.
I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.
I'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. Surely you would agree--
I was only hoping to make you understand.
Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?
Apparently I'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are.
Now that you understand the situation more clearly, perhaps you'd like to discuss the matter with the President
There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?
Hello--
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
You think it's all right for you to stay here?
Are you crazy? After what happened today?
Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.
He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.
You'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers.
Mr. Carpenter, I--  Goodnight.
I -- I was Just going to lunch.
I want to know what he told you last night.
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
It must be twelve-thirty.
I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
"Klaatu barada nikto."
I'm sorry.
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
Oh, I see. He was having trouble and you were helping him out.
Well, how do I know who you are?
Salt sticks to the bottom of his feet.
<u>I'll</u> have to drive!
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
Whattaya mean?
We are awesome monster-bashers!
That's right.
What?...
Don't!  Stop!
For a ride.
That is very probable.  What's your reasoning?
I thought they'd be in coffins.
I can't sleep with the closet door open, either.  Not even a crack.  Your father doesn't mind, though. It could be wide open for all he cared.  I think one of the reasons I divorced him was because he never believed... in the horror... of the <u>closet monster</u>!
I told Max eight o'clock.
Max?  You men we're having company again?
You have a T.V.?
Good!
Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck.  What's all that wood in there for?
Hi... I'm Laddie.
I'll hitch.
I watch him all day.  The only time I have more myself is at night.  Let Grandpa watch him.
That's the boardwalk, Sam.
Can I sleep in here with you tonight?
Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.
Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
What did you say?
Not another word!  I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.
Ohmygod...
Lucy.
So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy?  We've got it all.  Best selection in Santa Carla.
Max!  What's wrong?
I'm really sorry, Max.
Our batting average isn't very good is it?  So far we're zero for two.
Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
I thought you said they needed discipline?
Hi...
Star.
Me, too.
Do you know where David took me tonight, Star?  Do you?!
Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
David's looking for me... I have to go.
You've got to put this on.
Do I have to do this?
You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.
No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
Star.
Dogs don't eat each other.
... It could have gotten to somebody...
You can't let anybody leave!
Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
How you doin', old boy?
I don't know who to trust.
Watch Clark.
I've changed my mind... I'd... I'd like to come back inside... I don't want to stay out here any more... Funny things... I hear funny things out here.
Let go of me...
I suppose... well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me.  But...
Cut that out, Copper.  Nauls?  What's taking you?!
Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!
Look, I'm just guessing...
Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.
Then I'll have to kill you.
I think so.
Neither will we.
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
Anything?
And if anyone tries to wake me...
Nothing we can do about that.
How many in their party?
Oh, I got you.  Not too long.
Maybe it ain't coming.
Get your gear on.
... Made sure I got ahead of him on the towline on the way back... cut him loose.
Ah... no.
And everyone looks like us?
The Hall of Books.
No one ever comes here.  My mother told me stories about it late at night.  They tell all the children.
... Well, you wanted to see it.
Morlocks --
Send him away.
My God... I saw this.
This is the way in?
Machines?
Alexander... Listen to me, it was wrong to bring you.  You're not going to find what you're looking for.
How do you control the Morlocks?
We make them see what we wish.
How?
No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now.
Say I just come back again?
Now will you go?
If I can only find the right door... the lady or the tiger...
No...
That was a foolish thing to do.
But you've earned a reward for your valor.  I think you should become. You'll like it here.  Once you get used to the darkness.
Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
We took a walk three days ago.
Tonight's the night?
Where's the challenge in that?
The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand.
Alex, really... good luck tonight. She's a fine girl, and she's done wonderful things for you.
For God's Sake, David --
There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
And this would be my study.  There was an elm tree outside the window then.
Why?
All of you?
The mud carriers.
It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.
It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
Yes.
Oh huzzah, the master's home.
Here?
Sir, that curriculum is forty years out of date.  The students today are looking toward the new century -- they want to be challenged and inspired, not spoon-fed dusty old equations that have been proved a thousand times.  They want to explore.
With respect, sir, would we have the telegraph without fantasy? Would we have radium and X-rays without someone first dreaming we could?
No...
Oh, very different.  But not entirely... I mean we have lots of, um, trees and such.  But not everywhere.  And more roads.  And buildings.
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
We don't know.
This is out life, Alexander.  It's a hard life but it is how we have always lived.
Yes, sir.
I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week.
Should we be...
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
And what does that mean?
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
That's too bad.
I thought you said you never knew your father.
He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.
[Beat] What do you need me to do?
I need to get this letter to someone.
But I like it I guess.
Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it.
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
I know.
You gotta stop thinking like that.
It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just a cut. We can get it fixed. But we need to get you to the hospital now. How'd you get that?
Because I don't think I'm crazy.
I could try to...make it stop.
I never knew my father. Did you?
What case?
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
[Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.
And how do you know that?
You told me this was how it happened.
I wasn't talking about anything.
[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
So what am I supposed to do?
MacKenzie, [beat] what if we are crazy?
If you're deaf, read my lips...I don't need a psycho following me today.
You want a drink?
Yup. That's me.
This is a great song.
Have a good day at work today.
What?!
No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what we have for dinner.  I may not even make it home for dinner.  You know how Fridays are.
Lena, just cut the bullshit, will ya?  Do have any ideas or don't ya? I been standin' in this stupid parkin' lot all goddamn night, and I still got to go file a report before I can go home in time to get back up again!
Good.  You wanna tell me what happened?
How are things goin' out there?
You're still with us though.  You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
That's certainly possible.
Tell us about him.
It's just not working like this.  We gotta do something.  It'd be one thing if these girls were hardened criminals, but Jesus, Hal, this is makin' us look bad.  I don't know... maybe they're not movin'.  Maybe that little creep lied.
He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  Nothin' at all.  He already got all their money.  I just don't know what we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just wait it out a little longer.  She said she was gonna call back.  Let's just sit tight.
Stop.
Don't.  I'm married.  I don't feel good.  I've been sick.
You're beautiful.  It's okay.  I won't hurt you.  It's okay.
Louise, is that you?
I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?
That sounds nice.
Well, I was just down on my luck and it seemed like somethin' I was good at so I...
Jimmy!  Hello, stranger.  What in the world are you doin' here?
I always knew that.
I have a savings account with about sixty-seven hundred dollars in it. Now I know you won't be able to get it out, but I'm good for it.  I need that money.  Can you wire me the sixty-seven hundred dollars and I'll pay you back?  Please, I'm desperate.
Not yet.
And what's the mysterious code word?
Peaches.
Does it have something to do with another guy?  Are you in love with him?
In the back?
Am I in trouble?
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
Thelma!
Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.
I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.
Exactly.
We're gonna go to the next town and stop.  We'll get a motel room.  I can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money.  We're gonna need money.  Thelma.  How much money do you have with you?
Will I be?
He's got a lot to be proud of.
Are you sure we should be driving like this?  In broad daylight and everything?
Try to.
What for?
How'd they find out we're going to Mexico, Thelma, how they know that?
Louise?  Where are we?
Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.
I mean, look how different he looks just since high school.  It's bad enough I have to get old, but doin' it with Darryl around is only gonna make it worse.  I mean, I don't think he's gonna be very nice about it.
Oh, Christ.  I hate this guy.
Nothing.  It's not funny.
I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just play it by ear.  He may not know. He may just give me a ticket.
What do you mean?
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
It'd have to be pretty good.
I mean really!  That business with your tongue.  What is that?  That's disgusting!
You know what's happened, don't you?
I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
We're fine!  How are you?
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.
You're leaving it out. Finish your swing.  You're going to like this one -- she's half Asian, half American.
Each day is better than the next.  Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
I don't know.
Why not?
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
His mother?
Well then you've got to call her, man.
You are one lucky sonofabitch, you know that?
Fuck me.  Let's go home.
Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?
Huh.
Jesus Christ you're right.
You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!
Uh-huh. Where was he?
Mary.
Would you like a little clam-dip, honey?
Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
Very nice.
Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act.
Tell Bill to get the fuck off!
Here, just have one of these then.
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
Here. Spend it on your trip to Katmandu.
The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with.
Well it's more of an enclosure really.
They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
You know, sometimes I wish I could be like Magda and not go home. I'd like to just bounce around for awhile, do a little traveling...
A fucking moron.
I guess.
Turn it up, Magda.
Well, I know you're busy...
I don't buy it.
Ted, I'm the kind of guy who shoots from the hip. Now I want you to level with me: Did you knock this skirt up?
No.
So you found Mary?
Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
Look, uh, I've been thinking about everything you told me.
It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.
What?! You're calling me a stalker?
Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
Okay, Pat, take it easy -- don't do anything stupid.
I'm a phony -- just like you, man.
What do you mean?
Friend. Baseball bat.
Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
Hm?
A salesman -- that's what I am. I mean, I'm gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own company -- video sales -- just as soon as I get enough seed money.
What? Steve seemed to put up with Warren.
Bundt cake?
Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt yourself?
No, it's an old football injury.
Huh?
Are you all right?
Oh. So... what brings you down here?
Well you look great. Are you married, do you have kids?
Oh... are you... ?
So you're a writer?
Trying to be.
Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
Then what the fuck did you do it for?
Mary, come on...
But but what about Steve?
Shhhhhh!
Charlie, that's mean. Come on in, Ted. Don't listen to Mr. Wise Guy here. He's a joke a minute.
No, no, please!
We've been hailing the Groznyy for the last hour, Mr. Secretary. The Groznyy refuses to stop.
What are you doing?
Starshells.
With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.
Yes.
Well, I'm not.
We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.
We're going to have to stop a ship eventually, show the quarantine's got teeth, or we'll prove McCone right.
They're going to be pressing for a military solution soon. We can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats. We need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here.
I'll do it.
What happened to speak when spoken to?
Oh, still sore about this.
Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.
We're getting everyone together as fast as we can.
So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.
Still heading for Cuba.
I saw you out there. You want him to call you back, need you.
Busy. But you've got his heart.
I guess you won't be coming home tonight.
Okay. Kenny and I only show for the meetings you call us into. Impress us. And do it fast.  You're in charge of keeping this quiet. If word gets out before we know what we're going to do, there'll be panic. And it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them.
Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
You're scared to cancel on Daly.
We have to try the blockades. It probably won't work. It may just be delaying the inevitable. But we can't just go to war without trying not to.
We need those flights. We have to know when those missiles become operational, because when they do, we need to destroy them.
Didn't know Adlai had it in him. Too bad he didn't have this stuff in '52.
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
Dangle a settlement, tie us down in negotiations, we come up short...
Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
FBI? What you investigatin'?
It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.
Nice piece. You come back here to cover your tracks, Geronimo? What's your name?
It ain't Geronimo.
The right man? Talk to me, Ray.
I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed.
I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't believe it. I --
-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
What?!
You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
He knows me?
What's he smoke in that?
Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of your Imagination.
You tell me. You tell me who went to the B.I.A. -- Bureau of Indian Annihilation and said I was messin' with your case, man. I don't give a goddamn about your case.
That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.
So they took care of Leo.
Alright. Shit's comin' down. He's callin' council fire. All the old chiefs and the warriors, too. I gotta be at Grandpa's place in two hours. We need to get the tribe together. We need to block this thing.
I thought it was a rare case of a brother getting a break in the courts. We did an honorin' song for him and everything.
Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
X21, give me a 20.
X22. Read.
No, that was Leavenworth. This --  was Sioux Falls. What ya want?
No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here?
I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
What do you know about spirits? You ain't no In'dn.
Yeah, most likely.
No, I beg yours. But I don't think you're right on that.
Why not?
You saw a MiG 21?
I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
Yes, ma'am.
The what?
Is that all? CHARLIE What else do you want?
Evan... or Maverick.
Most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. MAVERICK Well, get used to it.
Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty work.
Danger?
. Yeah!
I'm fine.
What?
You don't have to do this.
You don't believe that.
What kind of games?
Strip reality! How do you play that?
I know exactly what you mean.
How could you?
Well... What   is   it?
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
We're locked on MiG ONE. Why doesn't he disengage?
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
Not anymore.
Rudder's left, stick's forward.
Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
No shit. The Iceman....
You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk!
What the hell is this?
Man, you guys gooned it. Your laser butts are scattered across KANSAS.
I was a victim of circumstance.
She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. The noise alone kept me up.
That's because you don't have any women.
Need a hint?
I've seen this before.
You won?!!!
Twenty years' experience, I couldn't shake you. You may be a great flyer. I mean that.
I never heard that.
Tell me something; are all psychics, uh....?
But maybe you can change all that.
How'd you find me?
Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker.
We can't let him run around.  He knows too much.
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
But I thought...
Listen to me!  He's been going on and on about Mars.  He's really been there.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
Brunette.
Sleazy...and demure.
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.
Any news of Quaid?
Richter!  Call from Cohaagen.
On his way.
Yeah.
Hey, Quaid!
You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!
Where is he?
I've got a weak signal over there.
Is that better?
You think I'm an idiot?  Remember our wedding?
O.K. then.  If I'm not me, then who the hell am I?
You sure you don't wanna...?  For old time's sake.  If you don't trust me, you can tie me up.
I suppose you're not here either.
Then I can pull this trigger, and it won't matter.
Nice to meet you.
Mars.
Let's see...the basic Mars package will run you just eight hundred and ninety-nine credits.  That's for two full weeks of memories, complete in every detail.  --A longer trip'll run you a little more, cause you need a deeper implant.
Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.
You.  You're the same.  No matter where you go, there you are. Always the same old you.  Let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself.  I know it sounds wild, but it's the latest thing in travel. We call it an "Ego Trip".
Hauser?  You're Hauser.
Oh, she isn't really your wife.  How stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife.
Forget I said wife.
I'm not falling for it.
I said get out!
Are you all right?  Are you still you?
Thanks.  God, I hope they're not screwed up.  I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.
Well, at least the bastard can't climb.  Pardon my French.
He'll never make it!  They're gonna get him!
So...now what?
Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year.
Well, I'm a victim of circumstance.
Car wash?!  That's got no future. If we're gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that.
What keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet.  I was up for going to Bixby.  I was getting excited.
In the past year I must've said a hundred times "We gotta get out of Perfection.  We gotta better ourselves."  You gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think I'm the reason we're still here?  You want to know how close I am to going to Bixby right <u>now</u>?
Jeez, look at that guy.
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
Pham Van don't get his mitts on <u>this</u> for no measly fifteen bucks!
Prairie dog burrow...
Maybe it is.  Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
Son of a god<u>damned</u> bitch!  Been waiting there all this time.  How the hell's it even know we're still here?
A car, huh?  Like a big armored car?  Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!
<u>I'm</u> making the run to the Cat.
Watch your ass, shithead.
Sell the movie rights.  We're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar.
She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both helped her out.
I'd do the same.  Well, catch you Thursday.
We're here, Val.  Just tell us what you need.  Come back.
That's the sky that's going to be over our roof every night, when we're done.
Hey Val, listen.  Bearing going out, you think?
Twenty.
Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
Rhonda's got an idea about that.
You paying attention?  This oughta hurt like hell.
What's it doing?
What?!!  Since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?!
From Chinatown... Which is right up the street from the morgue! Where did you go with the body? What did you do with it?
-- Then you don't wish to call any witnesses, Mr. Dowd?
We had a description of the suspect.
You see that? You wanna be like that?
I specialize, Roger...
I'm not a kid anymore, I can't be all over the map --
A Complaint Follow-Up form.
That DD-5.
I feel much better now.
You're carrying that around like it was a picture of your girlfriend!  I don't want to see your heart broken when this case crashes and burns!
Stipe was just one of four eyewitnesses who came forward, Kitty. Y'oughta start looking for the others...
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
I've phoned every art supply retailer and wholesaler in the Tri-state area. No one's heard of Chuckie Roeder.
Eddie... A guilty client's not the end of the world...
I don't know shit, man! Goddammit --
No.
Quite a bit you didn't tell me.
I did two tours in 'Nam...
Y-yes, sir.
Edward T. Dowd.
You won't remember this, but in '72 I was one of several prosecutors assigned to the Black Panther-Police Shootout.  We had a whole team, and you walked into court by yourself and kicked our collective butt.  So what've you been up to since then?
I see: He'd walk out next month.
But now you've strayed from your area of expertise -- dope -- into street assassins. A subject on which you're dangerously ignorant.
Isn't it unusual for a man who's just committed a murder in plain sight to bring the weapon back to his apartment?
Your Honor, that's trial by ambush!
-- Objection, your Honor! This case has no connection with any subsequent act my client may be charged with!
Did you do any hands-on work or did you just supervise, from on high?
I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.
It's okay. It was always like that.
What do you want?
Mr. Ortega... What is "La Compania"?
And its purpose?
Cigarettes, candy bars...  PCP, crack...
Chinatown. Sounded pretty cold...
A woman.
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
No... No, go away.
Go away. I am not talking to you.
I want you to kill for me.
It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
No shit...  We killed a guy for baby laxative.
It's 4:30. We close at five.
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
Can you tell me what their names were?
You weren't kiddin'. This stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend.
Okay, that's it. I've had enough of the waiting room now.
Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.
You try that you little monkey.
Agent Chet said he wanted to check the trailer court one more time. He had me drive the van with the body back here. Which we did. It was 105 miles.
Anything else?
Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the Blue Rose meant.
Stanley, I heard all about it.
And no one found the ring?
Someone else has it now.
Did she ever mention any friends?
Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.
What happened to her?
Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
That's good.
Accidental?
When he says, "Discussion", how do you take that, Agent Desmond?
You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
James called me last night looking for you.
When?
He probably wanted to drive over.
Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
No, and yes. I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.
Maybe.
Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike?
What are you doing?
Laura, I am your friend.
No.
WE got it back, that's all.
You got it.
Bob.
Maybe.
I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.
I already made you two tapes.
We were supposed to be together.
Shit, maybe he'll kill you.
Hiking?
You'd think so.
I understand.
I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.
We're late to get to your mother.
DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.
Did you get this from your lover?
Bobby didn't give you this?
There's no one here.
Nothing.
The man's an ambulance chaser...
How did you settle on the amount?
What is the truth?
Gruber...
...he wants to testify...?
I...
That's not my handwriting.
You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine?
Through, through his book.
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Objection!
Mr. Concannon...?
'Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my...
No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.
I... in that small context I would have... I would have to say 'no.'
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
I. Yes. It is.
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask?
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much...
I'm sorry...?
Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.  Her doctors murdered her.
I understand.
That's it...?  Come on, guys... life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.  Frank: I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand... and that's a lot of money... and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
Thank you for seeing me.
Why?
And is that what you're going to do?  Is that what you're going to do...?
Is this a bad time.
We, we... No... we just had a small reversal in the case...  I have some, uh... I have some work to do...
And it's over...?
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
From the magazine?
We find that your subscription lapsed...
It's locked.
A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anesthetic...
...I understand...
...I understand...
We just can't do it anymore.  This is our chance to get away.
We, yes. Yes. They, they present their side, and I get the same chance. To cross-examine... to... to...
You need my help...? You need a goddamn keeper... are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred-ten grand?  Huh...? Are you nuts? Eh? Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
Jimmy? Bushmills.  Lookit, do me a favor. I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse?
How are you holding up?
...one of the other nurses?
What did she do?
We got a mistrial, you know. Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
How'm I doing so far?
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
Did it do you any good?
Aw, he isn't that good...!
It's gone now.
I stayed right by the door - praying for the one who loved me best to come and find me.  It was Uncle Matthew who found me.
They could be as curious about us as we are about them.
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...
You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
We know now that we can't beat their machines -- but we can beat them!  They are mortal beings...The only question is whether we have time enough to do anything!
Right.
That's right - came down in kinda spurts, didn't it?  You fellers'll have to figure it out.  You're scientists  All I know - they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot.
Not all.  Radio is out.  But our field phones are okay so far.
That's because we want a chance to observe them.  This is the only place we've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them.  What happens here will be a guide to all other operations. The minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops, I'll get my report to Washington.  You've deployed your forces well.
And since you've been thinking of making it.  Has anything funny happened?
Might as well be, Dylan.  State of the art animatronics enhanced with bio- organic grafting.  Bull tendons, nerve bundles from a Doberman, even half the brain of a homicidal primate was...
Dylan, it's breakfast.  Not arts and crafts  What?
No, you don't.
Heather?
Like what?
No.
If these had been a few inches nearer to the wrist... What did you say you cut yourself on?
I want my kid out of here now!
no.
In what, a romantic comedy?
Holding my own.  You know that guy who was calling me all the time?  He's started again.  He's been putting stuff in my mail.
Yeah...how'd you know?
I know what he's doing is bizarre, but most of the time he seems so normal, so well adjusted.  I just can't believe it's him.  I mean, and not something outside, influencing him.  Or is that how denial works?
I've never mentioned it to him.
Freddy, for all I know.
I want to see the body.
I'll call the cops for you.  You've got the number on the fridge, right?
No, Rex is not going to die.  Julie, you know where the sewing stuff is, don't you?
Captured?  How?
The way to stop him is to make another movie.  And I swear to you I'll stay at my computer and keep writing until I finish the script.  But when that time comes...  You're gonna have to make a choice.
Robert?  I...
Sounds good.  Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee?  How you like it, Hon?
Black's fine.
Weight!  Hey!  Blow the man down...
Yes, Sir.
Well, that's all part of it.
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
It's a ninety-one!  It's an 'A'!
It's no my fault I was born first. Besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff.
Can we talk?
Sorry to here it.
They don't know that.  We were the only one's on deck. Look, there's nothing they can do to me right?  I'm a kid.
Do you have your ticket?
Passport?
How do you know?  They might.
Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?
Jesus, you never told them?
Ah... Northeast... sir.
Why do you think I'm sending him home?
Of a fight he can't win out here.
Twice.
Is that what you were trained to do?
So when the captain gave you an order contrary to your training, you thought he was making a mistake?
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus.  Man I knew we shouldn't have gone.  I tried to tell you.  I tried to tell you.  You guys made me come!  You made me come!!
Why'd you jump?
This isn't just a story!!  It's history made allegory.  It is a philosophical handbook for life!  It holds the secret of this very voyage.
You're the one who doesn't care, Phil.
About yourself?
What are we supposed to talk about?
You've gotta be kidding?
Suicidal...
Do me a favor and tell Bill once she's dogged down I want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear.  Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil will stand the watch.  Everyone else hit the racks.
Are you hating this?!  Are you!
Except, a "White Squall".  With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys...
It wasn't hard.
Soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta".
Well, that's so good to hear, Artie. You know some of us depend on you down this way. You're so entertainin' and you get so many interestin' guests.
I can dig this music... But not that singer.
He's so ugly. Guys with beards and beer guts ain't quite my type.
You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
Fuck me.
No.
I been studyin' a situation over in Lobo, take two men to handle it.
Whattaya mean family?
Don't think about it too long.  You had enough?
Have now.
Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good.
Alright... By all means. Make yourselves at home.
He served his time for what he did. Another thing... If Lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is - there ain't much can be done about it.
Listen, Johnnie, Lula just called me. She knew you were in N.O., so they left the city.
I'll meet you, Marietta, if that's what you want, but I'm against it.
Hey baby...
Did you ever think somethin' like about the wicked witch of the east comin' flyin' in?... Did you ever think somethin' and then later think you've said it out loud to someone?
I'd stand by you, Sailor... through anything.
You're terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know?
Well, sure. But he was super-gentle, you know? I mean, he raped me and all, but I guess there's all different kinds of rapes. I didn't exactly want him to do it but I suppose once it started, it didn't seem all that terrible. It was over pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there. I stayed in bed till I heard him drive off. Then I just went back into the kitchen and finished makin' my sandwich.
One hundred twenty decibels - head on collision of a '54 Ford Pick-Up and a '64 Chevy Station Wagon. No survivors. Balls of flame and grinding metal.
Wouldn't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives?
...I hope you appreciate my spendin' six hundred dollars, not countin' what it cost us to get here and back... This man's the best damn abortionist in the South.
You tell the boy who knocked you up?
It was my cousin, Dell, done it? His folks used to visit with us summers.
One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? Puttin' a detective on us. I'll tell ya Lula... Well... It's more'n me killin' Bob Ray Lemon...
You're excitin' me, honey. What'd she do?
It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?
I H-A-T-E hotel bedspreads. They don't hardly never get washed, and I don't like the idea of lyin' on other people's dirt.
Lula... I learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show I heard on the radio... How leeches is comin' back into style.
I love it when your eyes get wild, honey. They light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of 'em. Oh, Sailor you're so aware of what goes on with me? I mean, you pay attention. And I swear, you got the sweetest cock. Sometimes it's like it's talkin' to me when you're inside? Like it's got a voice all it's own. You get right on me.
Huh?
I do.
You think so, baby? Does my talkin' bother you, honey?
No, I like gettin' up around four a.m. and talkin' bout wild animals... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn't remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldn't remember any of my dreams.
You think he saw us?
You don't feel you was a little hard on the guy, honey?
What's wrong, sweetheart? Somethin' botherin' you?
What's that, peanut?
That night in the fire while my daddy was dyin'... I saw mama up in her room with Santos...
Trust me on it.
Anything I can do for you?
Sailor? You know what?
Can't tell yet. Where'd you go?
Yeah... He was lookin' for you.
That was in Vietnam.
You hungry? Pace and I ain't had dinner yet.
I'm sorry, Sailor. I just can't help it. Give me a minute and I'll quit.
It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot.
He ain't never known me, Lula, so there ain't much for him to forget. Not seein' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too.
Damn!
You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.
Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
Need me for what, mama? I'm perfectly fine, and safe, too.
Really, Lula, this ain't right!
I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
Really, mama, I gotta go.
I'm sure I wouldn't know, ma'am... and buffalo hunting too... hmmmmm?
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
Where?
You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.
No...
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
No.
Whattya mean?
So?
You really are one dumb asshole.
What he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. It lives in the mind.
Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. There's a place on the Hill I always get Trip to take me.
Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
It's the Chancellor.
Thank you.
Emily?
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
Do you know how many times I've boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my way to Pittsburgh.
Mm.
Trip??
This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.
Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a little raid on the Crabtree pharmacopoeia. You missed a few bottles, by the way.
Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's one of my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's --
Tripp?!
Oh, Christ, don't start on ol' Gran or we'll leave you here.
'That's my car, motherfucker.'
How are you -- is it Joe?
Don't sweat it. Well. 'Night, Jeff.
How long have you been having them?
How long have you been smoking marijuana?
'Fraid so.
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.
The one she wore on her wedding day?
Go ahead.
Shit, James. You shot Dr. Gaskell's dog.
You?
That's a big trunk. It fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly.
Oh. So. Is -- is your friend Crabtree -- is he -- gay?
Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the auditorium.
And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
I've got a thing about, places like this. I know what those houses are like. I know what the people are like.
James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
Kinship.
Want one. They're incredible. Incredible.
Because of my coat?
It's because you don't eat.
Where you going?
James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled.
I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like all your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down.
That good, huh?
Is that Cristaile?
Pow.
A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
I'm kidding. Hello?
Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...
Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something.
James Leer.
Oh?
I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady. But more importantly, Walter's not very happy and he's gotten the police involved. They seem to think James Leer is somehow responsible for all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where James is, would you, Grady?
I'm through improvising.
You don't deserve me, you know.
Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing?
Listen, Antonia --
What's that?
Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one.
That's nice. All we have is a Japanese beetle trap.
Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
Who's that guy?
And?
One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you?
Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour...
What?
When can I see her?
I remember when they all referred to me as "the little spic poor Annette married." Except her brother. You treated me with respect.  Look, you paid your dues. Your slate is clean now.
You need a table.
Then what? What?!
C'mon, Walter.
You should see my appointment book. It got crazy.
It's not what you think.
Isn't it?
I get horny as hell for other women.  I mean I fantasize about raping some beautiful woman.
Ask me. Ask me anything.
Is that right?
I don't like starlings.
Their sound is quite musical.
I'd love to hear it.
I would.
And when you sit by the window, watching the girls in the little cotton skirts parade by, do you wave your wanger at the girls? Is that when you jerk off?
Sure they do. But outside they've got trees around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature's symbiotic relationships.
Don't be witty.  Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus, Walter?
Fairy tales?
Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?
Woodsman?
I don't know.
Little Red Riding Hood.
You don't know?
I'll be asking the questions.  Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts?
A man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that?
You said last night. I went to bed pretty early.
What's with the boxes?
I'm adjusting okay.
Yeah, like the bird.
No you're not.
They sound like finches.
What will happen if I do?
I don't mind.
You should go home.
No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
Walter, I'd like you to try something for me.
I'd like you to keep a journal.
I don't understand.
It was just an idea.
That's right.
How's the journal?
Have to talk about something.
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
Why do you think you're here?
Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.
I suppose it's however society defines it.
Fuck you, Rosen!
I know --
Sorry.
No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see?
Who do you see?
Where?
How old are you and your sister?
This is garbage!
What else?
It was a small house.
It's going to take time, Walter.
How do you feel about that?
Are you okay?
Very weird.
You're quiet at work.
What about bears?
Something happened to you.
Why do you want to know?
It's been a while since...
Tell me about it.
Did I say something wrong?
So, what did you do?
How young?
I never hurt them. Never.
No. Prison is time. That's it. You think time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats... time.
For men like me. They say most of us end up back... there. I'm saying there are risks... seeing me.
Just think about it.
Most people don't have my kind of problems.
Sneak up behind me like that.
Yeah.
You done impressing yourself, ace?
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.  Do you read, over?  This is Deepcore--
Deep and slow, big guy.  Deep and slow.  Just breathe easy.
Thanks.  How you feeling, big guy?
Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.
You never did like being called that, did you?
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
If you say so.  It could be anything.
All I'm saying is when you're hanging on by your fingernails, you don't go waving you arms around.
How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
They'll come out after us.
You see where it's coming in?
I don't know how!
Don't argue, goddamnit, just--
Coffey, we're a little pressed for time.
Do we just leave him there?
You better not say you missed that.
Lady, we better fish or cut bait.
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
Copy that, continuing forward.  You just want me to get shots of everything, right?
Radiation is nominal.  The warheads must still be intact.
How many are there?
I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.  We need early warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.
1840... 50... 60... 70...
12000 feet.  Jesus, I don't believe he's doing this.
Uh, oh...
Hey!
Would we see the flash?
Then how come you're not with him?
Sandro... A month is too long a time. I have become used to being without you.
And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?
Which one shall I wear?
And have you any other truths to tell me?
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I...
It's already two hours... What are we going to do?
Have you decided?
How wonderful!
And why haven't they left each other?
You're very fond of Anna, aren't you?
Yes, you should go.
But it's so sad. So terribly sad. I'm not used to it, I'm not ready for it... You know... I have never been so upset in my life. Sandro, why don't you help me?
Let's get out of here, fast... This is not a town, it's a cemetery.
No, Sandro... We should go. Besides, we haven't been in touch with anybody. Not even with Anna's father. We should have at least sent a wire or telephoned... let's be fair, he must be feeling awfully lonely.
I don't love you.
Tell me, Claudia, what do you think of Raimondo?
He amuses me. I don't know of anything more amusing. Outside of this jigsaw puzzle. Don't you find it so, Claudia?
What do you mean by sensible?
More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at night.
Just several days ago, the thought of Anna being dead would have made me sick. And now, I don't even cry, I'm afraid she might be alive. Everything is becoming so damned simple and easy, even to deprive one's self of pain and suffering.
Please, you come too...
But for what reason should I come there?
They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken.
Why didn't you ask me to go with you?
I'll stay here also.
How did you spend the night?... In that hut?... And what did you have to eat?
And who is this?
What is it?
Goffredo is the Princess' nephew. He's eighteen years old, the lucky boy. And, what do you know -- he paints.
Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.
Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my father, too.
Certainly a radio this small is very practical. It's especially useful for... I don't know... for traveling.
Very well. First of all, I'll have them search the waters around the island. I brought two frogmen with me... Meanwhile, we'll take a look up around here.
I only exchanged a few casual words with her, as one would ordinarily do on a public bus...
We've decided to go to Montaldo's place. In fact, Ettore should already be there.
Oh... I'm sorry I have to rush but I've got to write a story about this thing that just happened... Tell me exactly how it all turned out.
About fifty miles or so. If you want, I'll give you the name of the storekeeper.
She'd punish me.
Because I'm getting fat.
Because...
That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful.
Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.
I'm not hungry.
It's not that... it's not that...
I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
Yes.
Don't you know?
I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.
What's your real name?
Are you married?
No.
Do you have any children?
Why not?
One.
From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know.
She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.
No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.
I don't know.
Do you?
Yes.
Is that what she said?
Yes?
Do you really love me or are you just saying that?
I really love you.
Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
I ate.
You don't like brussel sprouts?
Above the bed?  Any... anything else? What do you you see, something different?  What is it?
What do you feel?
Where?
So she sent you?
He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
Not your fault...
Agnes?  Who?  Mother Superior?
???
What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried case.
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
You have proof?
It's your favourite...
How do you survive?
Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves,  some wheat, corn, some vegetables.
Yes.
And you had a sister who died in the convent.
No-one.
Is that normal?
Could there have been anyone else?
Why do you think that?
Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination.
Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.
God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
I'm only interested...
???   ... virginity, right Mother?  Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.
Then help her.
How?
When would Agnes have conceived the child?
There's nothing here.
What sheets?
No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
I don't think I care to know.
She molested her!
Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
I haven't decided yet.
Her spiritual health.
Bullshit yourself!
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
All right?
Fine thanks...
Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
Saint Peter?
Do you think they ever existed?
Do you want to become one?
Do you think Agnes is still attached to God?
Why must he be anybody?
My God, you're as crazy as...
Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
A miracle is an event without an explanation. If she's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her womb?
But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.
She is an innocent.
This is permission to take her apart.
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
The baby?
The scandal...
You went to the room to help with the birth.
How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.
Lay them down.
They're yours.
I'm a deserter.
Yeah.
Yeah?
You don't think...
They'll be here.
Boys, you don't know what this means to me. If you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.
No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
Look, I'm terribly sorry but I'm afraid there's been some sort of a misunderstanding.
I don't care.
Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
Have I said something amiss?
Sure. .
Should I say it?
Go away! You've spoilt it.
Are you supposed to be here?
D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
I bet you don't sound like real people.
I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?
Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...  Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!
And you honestly think that's what she meant?
And what's it all come to in the end?
You're only right.
Lip reading.
What's he on about?
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
Yeah ... so what?
What little old man?
He's got you worried, then?
What's he know?
Please, can I have one to surge with?
Oh, it's got round that you're a heavy punter.
Leave him alone, Lennon, or I'll tell them all the truth about you.
You wouldn't!
What?
Hello.
Oh you are, I know you are.
And my nose...
I would have said so.
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
I knew I could rely on you.
But...
Yeah, you want to watch it.
It's not my fault.
He's been gone a long time.
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
Nerves.
I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
Good!  Maybe we'll be able to see something then.
Activate lifter quads.
I'm sending.  Do you hear me?
How do you feel, Dell?
Sorry to interrupt, but I'm gonna charge up the engines for a minute, okay?
What do you mean?
But we can't kill it.  If we kill it, it will spill all its body acids right through our hull and out into space.
It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm.  We were completely unprepared.
Boy do I feel a lot better.  It's a straight shot back to the Colonies, and then we can start taking bids on the paydirt.  Any bets on the top bid?
Jay... how's it coming on the repairs?
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
Might even incinerate the damn thing.
There.  Should be coming through about there.
Now we're in for it.
Yes?
How's Broussard?
He's running a fever.
Can you do anything for him?
Sounds like a rough one.
That's right -- we can't kill it on the ship, but we can at least keep it at bay -- and maybe drive it into the air lock.
It will be.
Well... now we have to herd that thing up here.
We can use the flamethrower.
Well, we can't go anywhere in this darkness.  How long till dawn?
Receiving.
It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too.
Time and space have no meaning out here.  We're living in Einsteinian equation.
They're on the next level up.
They're getting pretty close now.
These day and night cycles are totally disorienting.  I feel like we've been here for days, but it's only been how long?
Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert.  A high priority from the computer...
Zero.  Dry as a bone.
Find anything we missed?
Oh well... you know me.
What would you say that was supposed to mean?
Hey, can you guys hear me?
You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
We've got it up here!  It's trapped! Get up here fast!
What's it doing, having a seizure?
Hey, wait a minute!  That's all our food supplies in there!  We can't pump poison gas all over them!
Are you <u>crazy</u>?
Can you make out any pattern in all that?
Can we get to him?
Yeah... I forgot.
But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc!
What is it?
Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.
Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?
We've got no option.  We're gonna have to get it off.
MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.
Shit.  When?
One of 'em must have escaped.
What?  Are you nuts?  Just the two of us?
Still got him?
Shit!  Our armory's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores.  We got about two clips left for an autoloader, and that's it.
And...?
Communications to auto-shop go through an F.O. link off the main trunk. That's down with the other feeds.
Hey, boss.  Wondered where you'd gotten to.
Is that a fact.
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
Where'd you leave them?
It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
Eddie...
She mentioned, of course, that Margo expects to play the part?
Paved with what, then?
Some plain soda.  Lloyd must be expecting a record run in New Haven...
Not with me, you're no champion. You're stepping way up in class.
Addison, will you please say what you have to say plainly and distinctly - and then get out so I can take my nap!
Your name is not Eve Harrington. It is Gertrude Slescynski.
What of it?
No-no-no...
You can have one at Max's.
Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
We never met. That's why.
In my case it's necessary. Too many taxi drivers write plays.
It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.
I distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list. What are you doing here?
We have that in common.
Why so remote, Addison? I should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support...
Being violently ill to her tummy.
Naturally enough, your understudy.
Of course I knew.
Bill didn't say - but Lloyd was beside himself. He listened to his play as if someone else had written it, he said, it sounded so fresh, so new, so full of meaning...
Bill!
Good luck, genius...
Is it sabotage, does my career mean nothing to you? Have you no human consideration?
Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
Huh?
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
- you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe.
That I am...
Wait a minute! You can't hang up, you haven't even said it-
Bill... Bill, it's your birthday.
Happy birthday, darling...
It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me...
How is Eve? Okay?
I love you...
Don't let me kill the point. Or isn't it a story for grownups?
That never stopped you before.
I've always denied the legend that you were in 'Our American Cousin' the night Lincoln was shot...
What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
She hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! So when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom, Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - I won't have it! Eve Harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love! And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of!
The audition.
Here we go...
The playwright doesn't make the performance - and it doesn't just happen! And this one didn't - full of fire and music and whatnot, it was carefully rehearsed I have no doubt, over and over, full of those Bill Sampson touches!
Don't be condescending.
Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.
I wish it were.
Bill...  ... where are you going? To find Eve?
What would you like? Texas?
A married lady.
With the paper to prove it.
Often enough to keep the franchise.
Is it the money?
Ah...
I think we'd like very much. Sure you won't mind?
So am I.
What have I got to do with it?
From what would I be running?
The same size?
There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect!  I want to apologize for Birdie's-
Do you want an argument or an answer?
Like an agent with one client.
You all put together?
The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres-  Voila.
I've heard of them.
The maid'll fix it in the morning.
I'll just pick up the broken glass.
Why should you be? After all, six nights a week - for weeks - of watching even Margo Channing enter and leave a theater-
You're Margo Channing's best friend. You and your husband are always with her - and Mr. Sampson... what's he like?
But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
I thought you'd forgotten about me.
Not just that way. As a friend...
Nobody's done so much, Eve, you've got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the Hundred Neediest Cases... what is it?
Do you think Miss Channing would approve?
Then - would you talk to Mr. Fabian about it?
Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo. And every now and then there is nothing I want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.
There can't be very much-
Oh, but there is-
You know, I've always considered myself a very clever girl. Smart. Good head on my shoulders, that sort of thing, never the wrong word at the wrong time... but then, I'd never met Addison deWitt.  I remember once I had a tooth pulled. They gave me some anaesthetic - I don't remember the name - and it affected me in a strange way. I heard myself saying things I wasn't even thinking... as if my mind were someplace outside of my body, and couldn't control what I did or said-
I'm not crying.
- an understudy's performance.
He can help you.
Eve. I - I don't think you meant to cause unhappiness. But you did. More to yourself, perhaps - as it turned out - than to anyone else...
A part in a play. You'd do all that - just for a part in a play.
Well... it started with the play before this one...
I guess it started back home. Wisconsin, that is. There was just mum, and dad - and me. I was the only child, and I made believe a lot when I was a kid - I acted out all sorts of things... what they were isn't important. But somehow acting and make-believe began to fill up my life more and more, it got so that I couldn't tell the real from the unreal except that the unreal seemed more real to me... I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I?
Back to Copacabana. But Eve. Margo, let me tell you about Eve-
The hors d'oeuvres are here. Is there anything else I can do?
Terribly sorry I'm late, lunch was long and I couldn't find a cab - where's Miss Caswell, shall we start? Oh, hello, Eve...
Why not?
It's the tight girdle that does it.
Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...
Well... there's one indoors now. I've brought her back to see you.
It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous.
I just can't believe it.
It get better! "- About the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched First Ladies of the Stage to encourage, shall we say - younger - actresses; about Miss Harrington's own long and unsupported struggle for opportunity-"
With tears?
I remember.
Eve.
Eve?
She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo...
What with taxes coming up - and since I'm a playwright and not an oil well operator - well, I've been thinking...
Eve did mention the play, you know. But just in passing - she's never ask to play a part like "Cora," she'd never have the nerve...
No, I got the idea myself - while she was talking to me...
Lloyd Richards, you are not to consider giving that contemptible little worm the part of "Cora."
That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!
Well of all-
I didn't think you would! It seems to me, Karen, that for some tine, now, you've been developing a deep unconcern for the feeling of human being in general-
Have you forgotten about Eve? What she is, what she's done?
That was way back...
You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you?
You've been talking to that venomous fishwife, Addison deWitt-
We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...
Miss Caswell?  What?
I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?
Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would-
This is for lawyers to talk about, this concerns a run-of-the-play contract, and this you can't rewrite or ad lib!
--I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
What, though?  It can't be the Republicans--he'd never allow something as stupid as this, not when he's gonna slaughter McGovern anyway.
What do you think he meant, this particular incident? Were there others? How would we find out? You know anyone important?
Why didn't we get that?
I never scared anyone before.
--shit, who do we know?--
That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men--
Nah.  Maybe.
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
What's the matter?
Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.
--jeeeeeeesus--
--according to sources involved in the Watergate investigation. Beginning in the spring of 1971--
Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--
11:30.
I'll never get out of here in time.
The telephone calls... we know about that.
--Howard Hunt?
And you will.  But not now.
Could you reach Mr. Dardis by car radio?
You can't.
According to what we've been able to verify, you've been busy.
Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help?
--so?
--he was going to go into law practice with Segretti.
--and we got a guy in Justice--
--there's nothing new in it--
Absolutely--
Hannah, I never would have bothered you but I'm off to Miami and they're gonna take away my ten speed unless I get it straightened out fast.
Hey... very tense.
Five hundred; six maybe.
There's always a later plane.
This is practically a high school reunion for us, Jane--I would have sprung for a classier place.
This girlfriend of mine at the Committee, the other day she went back to the D.A. to tell the things the FBI didn't ask her. That night, her boss, he knew what she'd done. They control everything; that's how they know it all.
You don't believe me? Well, I was working the weekend of the break-in and my God, all the executives were running around like crazy--you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine--and when the FBI came to investigate, they never even asked me about it.
You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance, and we were sort of wondering, did you go work for Stans immediately after Sloan quit or was there a time lapse?
Which people?
A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis. 
Try and understand this. I'm a decent Republican. I believe in Richard Nixon. I worked in the White House four years--so did my wife. What happened on June 17 I don't think the President knew anything about. Some of his men I'm not so sure of.
--that leaves Haldeman, period.
I assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.
It was really nice of you to come, since you'd only met him once.
That twenty-five thousand dollars is money I collected for Nixon in this year's campaign.
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.  Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.
Ratfucking.
I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
Mitchell knew then.
How grand?
Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti.
I think so.
Are you sure?
Never? Please don't tell me never.  Ben says you've found some wonderful sources.
Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?
That's everything Bachinski had, I think it's worth following up.
Lotsa hints--
--remember Toronto, Harry.
--Harry, weren't you just arguing the opposite way?--
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
Go on.
No, it was good.
I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
What do you suppose they're saying?
Finch!  Get to the bathroom!  Now!
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
You can call me Oz.
Alright, cool.  I gotta hit the showers, but...I think this'll be really good.
What?!
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
Oz, it's okay, I know.
...I've never tried it.
Do you?
Like a bet?
No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.
Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.
Yes dad.
Dad.
Dad!!
Hold on.  You have no idea why I'm angry?
Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
You know, at band camp?  We have dances like this.  Only they're way funner.  Don't you think prom is just highly overrated?
Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
This was remade?  Into what?
I'll just say that we had a great night together.
What's up, fellas?
Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
No...you...go...ahead.
Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I can come by your house afterwards.  I can change clothes at your place?
Strip?
Move with the music.
Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
Yeah, are you?
Victoria...I love you.
That was a great night.
I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.
God, I can't believe there are so many cool people at this party.
Merde! I can't believe this!
Okay... dead or undead... what do you want from me?
Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
What?
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.
Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.
What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid?
Hello?
I don't... I... I can't remember...
Because, Andy. It's a cure.
Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...
I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
No wonder he let her go.
God. I can't believe it.
Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
These tunnels must loop around and connect.
Okay. Be careful.
Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
Bullshit! You're bluffing!
Claude...?
Ha. Some wonder drug...
But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
I'm sorry my friend, I'm not signing books right now. There's been a tragedy.
Psychic awareness. Right.
He's on a new drug called ZBH, or "Daydream". It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time.
You didn't know? But then why did you... well, don't worry. It's relatively mild.
It killed him... You coulda just used Draino. It's cheaper.
Andy? Andy is that you?
Oh shit! No! Andy, don't let them take me back there!
Andrew Mc-dair-mo?
He's in charge but, uh, between you and me, my English is better.  This way... So you're from New York eh? I love those Hill Street Blues...
Well, here's what I think happened. A chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. Why? Perhaps he's making a few francs on the side. The psychedelic drug market is big these days. He gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas.
Why would he pick this one?
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
You fucking liar!
Who did you hear it from?
Well, I don't have any money . . .
Is everyone all right?
You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.
By pulling my hair?!
...fish fork, salad fork, meat fork and. . .  [THIS SECTION ALSO NOT LEDGABLE]
What a beautiful ship!
I'm glad you found what you were looking for.
No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think...
Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
PARSE HOLDS THE KEY TO MY HEART FRENCH- BAT- CHICKS HANG OUT AT MONTMARTRE WE'LL EAT SOME IN-SECTS THEN GO BACK AND HAVE --
It's her.
He's her?
But this invitation came from the Empress herself! It's the social event of the decade! You can't turn it down!
Rasputin!
I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ...
Please, if you'd just listen...
And tell me that she's happy.
Rasputin!  You're alive . . .
Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
What's your name?
I'm... I'm, uh, I'm Robert Redford.
Come on.
Well, you take a meeting with him, I'll take a meeting with you if you'll take a meeting with Freddy.
It's an important issue.
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
What do you mean, next?
Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
I-I-I-I would leave out the men's- room attendant.
I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.
Boy, those guys in the French Resistance were really brave, you know? Got to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.
What-what-what-what's the matter?
It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly... We're-we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Get him!
Annie, there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator. I can't get it out. This thing's heavy. Maybe if I put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it will run out the other side, you know what I mean?
Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera.
Oh, I'm in her acting class.
Well, where is it? I-
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.
Who? Grammy? Grammy Hall?
Fifteen years, yeah.
I know.
But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean  oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna-  gonna sing. Yeah.
Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club. I don't-
That's okay, 'cause I know exactly what that's like. Listen-
Yeah... oh, uh, and I'm gonna have a pastrami on white bread with, uh, mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce.  Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you and, uh, were you depressed about that?
H'm?
Really. I mean it. I-I'll never play the piano again.
H'm?
Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, I think. Big-
There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, you know?  He's the latest! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. He placed third.
Oh! Italian, right?
Come on.  Yeah. You know what? You know, I like you, I really mean it. I really do like you.
That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs.
You don't want me to live with you?
Ye-ah. Was it... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.
Yes, it is.
Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.
It relaxes me.
Uh-uh-why?
"Neat"! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."
Yeah?
M'm.
M'hm.
That's amazing. I-I-I... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got... nothing like that in-
I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?
Oh.
Oooh.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
What is this? What are you, since when do you read the "National Review"? What are you turning in to?
Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?
Yeah, where is the spider?
Yeah, but no presents till midnight.
What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway?  Let me see. Okay, let's... oooh, God!  Oh, you knew I wanted this...  God, it's terrific, God!
What thing?
Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.
Oh, oh, no, I can't-I can't eat this. I'm nauseous.  If you could-if you could just give me something to get me through the next two hours, you know I-I have to go out to Burbank... and give out an award on a TV show.
I'm into garbage. It's my thing.
Oh, good. Okay.
Alvy, uh, let's face it. You know something, don't think our relationship is working.
Whose "Catcher in the Rye" is this?
You mean that...  I-I-I-I flew three thousand miles to see you.
Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
Bad?
Oh, no, no, don't be... tsch... don't be silly. You know,  I'm startin' it-I'm startin' to get some feeling back in my jaw now.
You know, it must need to have had its leading from one thought to another. You know what I'm talking about?
What I wouldn't give for a large sock o' horse manure.
Why, Max? It's a good name for you. Max, you see conspiracies in everything.
Oh.
What's the matter?
Oh, he-he didn't say anything.
She was stealing.
I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
You think so? Do you really?
No, no, no, not at all.
...of possibly working together.
Uh... w-we're going back to the Pierre. We're staying at the Pierre... and we're gonna meet Jack and Angelica, and have a drink there, and... if you'd like to come, uh, we'd love to have you.
I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
I was a great beauty.
There were many men interested in you?
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
You're not upset that I brought the dog?
And you've only just met.
You don't have any clothes on.
What what's about?
You want a Tylenol, or something?
Don't you miss it?
You should have brought him.
Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
That for us?
When does he graduate high school?
Harry called.
You need to call your dad.
Are you my big brave boy?  Are you my brave hero?
Oh yeah...
Hey!  Would you?
It was fifteen seconds.
The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat.
There's still time to undo this.
What was it?  What the fuck was it?
Still champions.
Otis!!!!
And how fucking dare you cast Skye Davidson in that part?  Have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  I'm an actress!  It's about our marriage for fuck's sake.  Everybody knows that...
About me!
I don't want to go tonight.
I know.
What's a sign for that?
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
Yes.
You manage to throw me off balance.  I adore you.
But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
And so I always manage to, do you see? Like the book/script thing, do you see?
The infamous dog?
Something soft.
Sally did all this herself?
Oh.
A little out of my element.
No you're not.
Hm.
Oh shit.  I'm sorry.
I need to leave you now.
That's a lot of those.
Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.
I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair.  But the moment was exactly the same.  The same, you know, dynamic.  And almost verbatim, wasn't it?
I'm not going to leave you alone.
God willing.
Don't go in, Ryan.
Hi.  Monica and Ryan?
Thank you.  I understand you're an interior decorator.
That was my clue.
Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!
Fuck you, Panes.
Exactly what I mean.  It's all ruined.
It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
How's the movie going?  Your movie.  You are making a movie, aren't you?
I don't want to talk about it.
Well, something's wrong.
You're my best friend.
That's not an answer, is it?
Panes?
Well the neighborhood is full of dogs, and it's not always Otis.
In the guest room.  I've laid out a paint table for them.
We're always in here.  She really gets him, doesn't she?
Well, I don't trust her.  I never have.
She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.
Sophia!  I'm not even pregnant!
Well good.  Thank God.
Well, are you sure about this baby thing? It's not the ticking clock shit, is it?
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --
I don't know what came over me, talking back like that.  I must be going crazy...
Wait a minute, that's no soldier -- that's Z!
You know, you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be! Look at Z!  He started as a worker -- then he became a soldier!
Well, because he's more than a worker...he's a...what did he call it, Azteca...
Well...  I declared war!
Really?
Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time.  Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble!  You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
Wait!  When can I see you again?
Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, I think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you.
Water...water...
Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's <u>wrong</u> with me?
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
You held onto this all that time?
Z!  what are you doing?
I mean, I've got the whole package, right?  A great life, a beautiful wife, and a few kids.
No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble.  Now, time for some R and R.  You're invited to the royal victory party!
I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.  Don't you want your aphid beer?
Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
You have to help me.  Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you!
You're a real buddy.
Yeah, I know.
What do I do?
All right -- I'll tell him.  Hey, Baxter -- that was Personnel. Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
Care to make a small wager?
It was making me nervous, so I chopped it off.  Big mistake, huh?
You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise.
You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.
Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
Just tell 'em -- now and then.
This date -- is it just a date -- or is it something serious?
Eight-thirty.
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --  I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
Marry Christmas.
You shouldn't.
Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
Three.
I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.
No problem. Why don't we discuss it sometime over the holidays -- I could call you and pick you up and we'll have the big unveiling --  -- you sure this is the right way to wear it?
Oh.  Yes?  Just a minute.  If you don't mind -- this is sort of personal
I don't understand --
I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --
Two o'clock.
Miss Kubelik, I'm stronger than you are --
I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
And where are you now?
Your stomach?
That's why we have to be careful -- we don't want to involve anybody -- after all, Mr. Sheldrake is a married man --
Yes, I've got it.  Don't you think we'd better destroy it? So it won't fall into the wrong hands -- ?
Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965.
So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
I don't want to talk to him.
In this house, you're supposed to.
I was washing my stockings, so I decided I might as well do your socks.
I guess so.
I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You think it's the end of the world -- but it's not, really. I went through exactly the same thing myself.
You did?
Anyway, I parked the car and loaded the gun -- well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy -- I mean, how do you do it? -- here, or here, or here --  -- you know where I finally shot myself?
Where?
You usually eat alone?
Are you sure? How's your knee?
What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
Baxter?
Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.
Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it that makes you so popular?
Look, Baxter, I'm not stupid. I know everything that goes on in this building -- in every department -- on every floor -- every day of the year.
There's a certain key floating around the office -- from Kirkeby to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch -- it's the key to a certain apartment -- and you know who that apartment belongs to?
West 67th Street. You have no idea what I've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key --
Fine. And I want you to know I'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me -- SHELDRAKE Sure you will.  Say, Baxter, about the apartment - now that you got a raise, don't you think we can afford a second key?
Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?
You see a girl a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're going to divorce your wife. I ask you -- is that fair?
No, sir. That's very unfair -- especially to your wife.
And I've got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over.
My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been shifted to the Denver office, and you're taking his place.  What's the matter, Baxter? You don't seem very excited.
I got kicked in the head, too.
Don't mind what?
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
I dig.
Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.
Now hold on, Baxter --
Baxter?
Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.
I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl -- there are millions of them.
Instead of Friday -- could you possibly switch to Thursday? You'd be doing me a great favor --
Say, why don't we have ourselves a party -- the four of us?
Oh, yes, Mr. Dobisch.  I didn't recognize your voice --
It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
We went to bat for you -- and now you won't play ball with us.
Dear Mr. MacIntosh --  Vanderhof, Public Relations. Oh, yes, Baxter. Just a minute.  All right, Miss Finch -- type up what we got so far.  Now what is it, Baxter?
Look, Mr. Vanderhof -- I've got you down here for tonight -- but I'm going to be using the place myself -- so I'll have to cancel.
I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she didn't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- believe me, Doc, I'm not thinking about myself --
Sure, Doc.
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.
Can you use a bottle of champagne?
I see.  What do you think, Al? Can we help the man?
Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.
Tell me again -- what's my name?
And what happened to you?
Do you know where you are, Fran?
I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
Fran -- remember that last weekend we had?
Handle what?
Now, Fran --
I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.
You got to watch those things. Wives are getting smarter all the time.  Take Mr. Bernheim -- in the Claims Department -- came home one night with lipstick on his shirt -- told his wife he had a shrimp cocktail for lunch -- so she took it out to the lab and had it analyzed -- so now she has the house in Great Neck and the children and the new Jaguar --
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
Yes? Oh, hello -- sure I got home all right -- you owe me forty-five cents.
But I thought you could hold your tongue.
See if they'll what?
Oh -- I see -- Well, girls, this is Captain -- eh --
Look -- you know who that is, Captain -- you know what she's saying -- you'll never see stuff that good outside of a magazine for the rest of your life.
How far do you think you can push -- what kind of people do you think --
One for all -- all for one --
You make some of your closest friends in the army -- war has a way of bringing men together.
I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.
That's quite an array of ribbons...
A long time.
He was working A.R.V.N. patrols and had one a them little cocky gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow, the Lieutenant took his new Playboy one day, sat on the end of the dock, and wouldn't give it back.
Call me what, sir?
When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.
Shot himself. What for ?
What the hell is it?
Our Recon flight ?
Hey, buddy, that boat still runs, eh?
Spooky.
Charlie?
No, sir.
Upriver? Why upriver? There is nothing there, only jungle.
When I was a boy, my father would take me there, to hunt. There are a few savages, but no man can live there, no white man.
Two of my men deserted last night. It happens from time to time. I assume my daughter told you of our conditions.
Good swell.
Big Duke Six to Hell's Angels Four -- bring it in on along tree line and huts.
Hell's Angels Four to Big Duke Six -- we'll need green smoke -- suggest you have the FAC mark it.
Seems to me he got himself fragged. i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent. Maybe a rumor. Helluva man -- remarkable officer. Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day. General of the Army. Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?
Don't you agree?
You'll find enough Cong up there.
What Truth?
No water.
I think think a lie stinks.
Going back  - to the jungle to die.
Yes...
Were you with him, when...
Maybe he'll get tubed.
I don't think he'd of shot us on the beach but -- he'd of shot us if he saw me taking the board --
Sure.
Captain Willard?
Why did they attack us?
What's a big question?
Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain.
I know.
That's 27, sir.
23   CONTINUED:
First you save my ass, now you want to kill me.  Make up your goddamn mind.
Relax.  I got a nervous man here with a magnum up my nose.
215  CONTINUED:
212  CONTINUED:
What are you doing?
Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.
I'll wear it for you.  And I can wear it when we go home.  We won't be here forever.
It's exactly what you meant.
High-tech in the wilderness. Gets me excited, too.
Be careful, okay?
I'll tell you everything later.
Can't be much of a crime, if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid.
Let's camp.  There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.
Forget it.  It would take days.
Where in hell Meyerling dig you up?
Stay awake!  You want to go hypothermic?
I already have.
You were real resourceful out there.  Got me thinking of this perimeter man, froze all his fingers one winter.  So he hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones.  Gets along better than ever.  Yeah, maybe I underestimated you.
Shut up!
Can you walk?
I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
What's the problem with Sam Wilder's place?
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
Fuck you.
You hear me?  Ben?
Huh?
How was it talking to him?
Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.
He's gotta fight to breathe. His asthma can just shoot off the charts -- he's allergic to dust and this is New York and his immune system bails on him when there's trouble so an ear infection...  Is this bothering you?
Okay.
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
I'm not kidding.
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
Okay.
I can't. I work.
Hello?
Whether crabs are in season there now...
Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.
Thanks, Melvin.
Nonsense!
You don't owe me that.
Go ahead.
Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
Stop staring. Do a vase.
Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
But what about...
Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like I have any choice in barging in.
Simon, you've got to get dressed.
I'm not saying nothing to you.
Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?
The medical bill are 61 thousand now. I've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.
Sure thing.
You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.
Where are all your queer party friends?
That's very thoughtful.
Well, I always painted. Always. And my mother always encouraged it. She was sort of fabulous about it actually... and she used to... I was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it... and she was very natural. She used to pose nude for me... and I thought or assumed my father was aware of it.
What are you talking about? You got real problems.
Did you like it that much?
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
So you're practically finished, huh?
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
Why?  What happened?
Get out.  You think I'm running you up?  Get out.
What are you doing?
Did you see how I did that?  Magic wasn't it?
I'm on the scent.
Michael?
Who?
I don't know what the fuck you are.
I give a fuck?  I'm done!  I quit! Do you fucking hear me!  I'm fucking gone!
A player?
He has to clean up.  How many bodies were there?
I work for the government.
Yeah.
Another contractor.
Forget it!
As in daughter of Agamemnon?
Had?
He was... taken.
Why not?
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
Why not?
Yes.  It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.
Are they usually like that?
You said you didn't trust it.
Do you think about the game?
What will you do if this works, if we get the money?
I've always wanted to learn something like that.
Okay.  Then what?
He won't be able to.  He'll have to go inside.  He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there.  If the bank closes, he won't know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm sure.  And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun.
That means you won't have a gun.
Except --
He wanted what I want now; to get out of the business.  To disappear to some empty Greek island.
What?
I don't know.  When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.
What are you doing?
Why?  I don't know.
I didn't want to complicate the situation.
Did you --
No.
I waited another four minutes.
He's coming, Electra!  Get out now!
You're very good at this aren't you?
I think I've heard of you.
That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay.  I feel good.
So how's your work?
You guys having a go a me or what?
Anything in it?
Oh yeah, what's that?
I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.
Right and not just the bar, Lubosh and his mates took the whole freakin' building.
You were right Jahn, it's a great space..... Hey, Chris. Do you want to come and look?
Chris, what if I were to cut you in as partner in this project - together we could make it swing, all it needs is a good clean out and the power on, then we're in business.
Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
Just two things. What do I use to shift the stuff and where in hell am I gonna put it all?
Scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. If there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.
I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
Really, "The Freeman Centre"?
And suppose a little old lady lives there?
Yeah, her name's Kavlova, why?
Could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
Just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better.
We'd better get some booze in for tonight.
Get me a couple of beers and a salami.
Thanks. Come on Chris, give me a hand.
My God! What happened?
What are you on about?
Chris, can you do me a favour?
So I hear.
No, but I ran into Jahn, seems him and his friends are in big trouble with the University, they might even be expelled.
What happened?
You know, there is one thing I can't figure out. All along they've been bugging me about those files and when I told them I'd burned all that stuff, they went nuts - they told the Consul guy they were medical records?
It was all in Czech wasn't it.
What happened to those disks I gave you, have you still got them?
Well, he should be on his way back to his apartment by now.
No, by road?
That one?
Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
Well a plea of ignorance won't go far here. Frankly, I think you deserve everything that's coming.
Before you go, did you get those bruises here?
Hmm, I see possibilities but you got a lot to do.
So why don't you get up and speak something, then we will see who is crazy.
I'm not staying out late and I can't come back to your place.
Don't give me this Kat, I'm doing it for you and your country.
Beer please! Do you want another drink?
Yep, it's all yours.
They'll do it.
Yeah, it's a simple piece. If they get the floor done in time, me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon, but it's not critical.
How?
No act of love but willing violence demanded by one and begged by the other. As life turned to fantasy and reality to ecstasy a need, so deep no light could reach, surfaced like a nocturnal creature unearthed for momentary and glorious display. Left alone in a rose-tinted afterglow dimming fast she tasted the moisture of her body and wondered why light came to day and such desires to her pale-skin body.
No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.
I'd better get going, do you need a hand to get into bed?
Uh-huh!
Where did you steal the car?
It's Josh's.
You will wish you hadn't.
Thanks, but I don't intend to stay.
Sure!
No problem, is it at your place?
Just yesterday.
Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?
Have you lost all control of this city?
I don't understand it, there were a lot of people there last night, many Americans, I believe we should move carefully.
What if his accomplices have made copies?
That's one girl who can't take a hint.
Pictures from the play. Jamie looks pretty --
No. You're with who you should be. It's like she chose you.
'Bout what?
Your father dropped off an extra check.
That's over. Way over.
You're fine like that, Mom.
Were you with Jamie?
I could take after Dad, too.
What are you doing here?
Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.
'I hope your dreams come true.'
'They won't.'
-- This play means a lot to me.
He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
He okay?
You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
The cells in our bodies are always changing. In six or seven years all your cells have changed. You could be like a completely new person from the inside out.
It's places like this that make me certain there's a God.
What'd you tell your father?
That what you do?
One of your secrets.
Whatever you need. Whatever Jamie needs. I'm here.  I could start by driving her to school --
I am mad at you! And at Landon! And the universe! And God!  I don't even know where to put all my anger.
Reverend Sullivan. Can I ask you something?
Landon. You go on home.
For Jefferson High. For books.
What do you want, Biff?
This is 1952....?
How was school today?
You mean you're going to stay up all night?
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
George! He's supposed to ask you to the dance!
Now, George! Dinner's ready now!
Well... yeah...
Your line, George!
Unfortunately, the way things are going, you may get your wish. You may see the entire annhiliation of the world. If not, you'll certainly see the destruction of all out natural resources. We can already see the air we breathe, not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes. We'll  see all of our oil reserves depleted, in fact, all of our energy sources. Yes, you people have a lot to look forward to -- a lot to see.
You're the only Mr. Lewis in this class.  If you have something to say, say it so the whole class can hear.
Well, yeah, I was thinking, if cars are gonna be going two or three hundred miles an hour, they're gonna be using an awful lot of gas. Like, what if we run out?
Operator, what's today's date?
Good evening, one said. Agents Reese   and Foley, from the Nuclear Regulatory Commition.  Mind stepping over here?
Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.
Pro, the sun's out!
A mall?
Pardon me?
The test is this Monday! 15 megatons... Let's see, we need 4200 rads...  You'd have to be...exactly 800 yards from ground zero... You realize that what we're going to do could be extremely dangerous.
Your 'mother' wanted me to tell you that she was very impressed by what you did this afternoon, and that if you were interested in going to the dance Saturday, she's available.
In a manner of speaking, yes. And because of that, she's no longer interested in your father.
Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.
But I told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. So don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.
What theater was I at?
Uh, yeah... Gimme a Tab.
No way!
Hi, Marty!
Well, he's gone.
Okay.
Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
What for?
Sure.
Just don't... I've got a headache.
I don't care.
I came in the front.
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.
I found a lid. It was laying on the ground over there.
How's he doing?
You tired?
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
No.
Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
Planet 10?
Arachtoid.
Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy?  The invisible body?
Pull up!  We did it!  Holy shit, we did it!  Pull up!
Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...
Who were you really trying to kill last night?
Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
You keep an eye on it.
I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.
Believe in Penny Priddy?
It's too dangerous.
Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?
Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  It's unusual, but no cause for alarm.  Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same problem.
Please, Barton.
...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for him!
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his 
Before what?
...This'll sometimes help.
M'honey pretends to be impatient with me, Barton, but she'll put up with anything.
How long you been up there, Fink?
What else?
...No, I've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain. Maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one's fellow man  to help somehow to ease his suffering.  Maybe it's a personal pain. At any rate, I don't believe good work is possible without it.
What's that?
I'm sorry, I just feel like I know I shouldn't ask, I just need some kind of help, I just, I have a deadline tomorrow-
Sure he did. And he forgot about it before your ass left his sofa.
To do what?
Barton? What time is it? Are you all right?
What do you mean, Barton?
...That's fine.
That's all right, really, thank you.
Can be. Not easy, but 
...In spite of what you might think from tonight, I'm pretty good at it.
I can feel my butt getting sore already.
Sure you could!  And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man  from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and  and  and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and  well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.
You're all right, Charlie. I'm glad you stopped by. I'm sorry if  well I know I sometimes run on.
Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, I'll let you know if I'm bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view.
...And look, I'm sorry as hell about the interruption. Too much revelry late at night, you forget there are other people in the world.
Howdy, neighbor.
Thanks, I'd invite you over to my place, but it's a goddamn mess. You married, Bart?
...You're a little out of your weight class, but just for purposes of demonstration 
It's okay, it's okay.
I hope these are your shoes.
Hi, Charlie.
Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
Sure, Charlie.
...Where did we put him?
I apologize, Barton.
Mr. Lipnik.
Got a couple questions to ask ya.
Also known as Madman Mundt.
Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.
Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description?
Yeah.
It's Internal Affairs, isn't it?
Sometimes I really hate you.
Did you know Noah Goldstein?
You should do something about this lock.
Because you didn't love him --
I'm tired.
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
Noah was my counselor in my freshman year.  That's probably where I got the idea for the icepick.  For my book. Funny how the subconscious works.  Hazel is my friend.
I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.
I like you.
What if I asked you not to call me Shooter?
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
Say -- "What do you want from me, Catherine?"
What's it about?
You mean did I write it before my parents died?
Yes.
Good.  I'd miss you.  You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.
What did you think?
How about Roxy?  Is she a fuck to the century, too?
I thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty.
No?
Do you believe me?
I don't know.
How'd you get in here?
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
I have to do some research tomorrow.
I'm very good at research.  I'll help you.
Somebody has to die.
What do you want, Nick?  Flowers? I'll send you some flowers.
I hate rugrats.
There is no smoking in this building, Ms. Tramell.
Did you ever tie him up?
That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
Routine.
Nope, can't say that I do.
The usual -- a girlfriend.
Who was this fuckin' guy?
Before your time, pop.  Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits. He's got a club down in the Fillmore now.
Forgive me for askin', son, and I don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass?
You oughta use a rubber, pop.  You really should.
Why the hell not?
I don't know.  I'm just not.
Why not?
How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs.
He left the club with his girlfriend about midnight.  That's the last time anybody saw him.
Gus -- go over to Berkeley. Harrigan -- find out what else she's published.  Andrews -- get the files on her parents' accident. Carbon Beth on everything.  I want some psychological input on this Andrews and Harrigan go; Nick is left there with Gus.
I'll ask you once, Nick -- for the record did you kill him?
First you've got her buying your file.  Now you've got her killing Nilsen.  Forget her, willya?  Go someplace.  Sit in the sun.  Get away from this goddamn fog.  Get her out of your system.
I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I'd take some of them out.  I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.
What about the shit they write?
Yeah  I'd do that... You could teach me.
I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents.
I wanted to make a few more of these. Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It makes a good green.
How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
I'm interested in showing Jean's work.
You're not?
Yup.
Yeah, just put their bill on my tab.
It's Maria Portos. What should we do?
The Devil, man. Rene Ricard. Art critic  writes for Artforum. People read him. Tell him who you are..
I knew I left these somewhere. One of these'll send your kids to college someday.  Here  I made this for you.
About what?
Who's John Henry?
Good.
... babies.
I'll take three big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
It's three thousand dollars!
You did it! You made it. I'm a painter, too.
Hi.
Come on.
That's a beautiful name. French?
You see? You have someone to live for.
You heard of Albert Milo. I made that niggah. I'm Rene Ricard. Didn't you read "Not About Albert Milo?" I know who to hype. Baby, I'm gonna make you a star.
Fuck band practice... If you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts  you don't wanna be like Tony Bennett..
You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true.  There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?
I didn't know.
Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
Sorry.  I mistook me for somebody else.
Well that's a ... long story ...
Well, I could ... free up some time...
... Maybe I'll watch it on TV.
I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
What went wrong?  Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her.
Photojournalist.
Well?  Was "Vicki" right?  About your difficulty with duality?
'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.
Hmm.  Primitive ventilation.
Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
"Oswald" is linked to the Red Triangle Gang.  I can't prove it but we both know it's true.
Ingenious costume.  Let me guess ... Trust-fund goody-goody?
Your blood, Max.
You killed me, Batman killed me, Penguin killed me.  Three lives down.  Got enough bullets to finish me off?
A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference.  By the way, how's Fred Adkins, your old partner?
We need signatures.  To overturn the ballot.  I can supply those, Oswald.
He didn't even lose a limb, an eyeball ... bladder control ..
Max!  Relax!  Josh and Jen'll put a spin on this.  We'll talk it over tonight, at your costume par--
I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
And a very, very good one.
Selina?!  Selina ... Selina ...
In spirit only, I'm afraid.
What seems to be the problem?
First Ivy had an intoxicating effect on both Dick and me.  Tonight my feelings spread to someone else.
I started racing after my parents died.  There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of myself, that made the hurt go away.  You wouldn't understand.
Alfred has supported me my whole life.  Now I'm going to pay him back. I'm going to liberate him from his dismal life of servitude.
Alfred's happy here.
You were a great scientist once. Don't squander your genius on evil.
Mr. Freeze.
The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
I thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs.
Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
How did you...?
She's still alive.  He's adapted his freezing technology to reverse McGregor's Syndrome.  He's even found a cure for the early stages of the disease.
Dr. Pamela Isley.
What can I do for you, Doctor?  A research grant?  A hospital wing?
I see you knew him.
Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat.  No coolants to preserve food.  Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
You're not even listening to me.
Make a choice, Bruce.  Her or me.
McGregor's Syndrome.  That's what Freeze's wife had.
Like hell you do.
Well, I, my most unabominable snowman, have been impressed by you. In fact I propose a pairing.  So I'm here to set you free.
No gun.  How disarming.
You will distract the bat and bird while I prepare to freeze Gotham.
That is far too merciful.  Batman will watch his beloved Gotham perish, then I will kill him.
What say we turn up the heat?
I'm glad you came.  I can't breathe without you.
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
Then you never loved me?
Dr. Isley?  Pamela?  You look great. Especially for a dead woman.
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
No. You said I. I killed them.
Why do I keep doing this?
Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
What?
What do maniacs always want?
May I help you, Master Grayson?
How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
Oh please. You're blind as a bat.
Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind?
Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you?
Would you? I'm not so sure.
Excuse me.
That kid is amazing.
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
Look, I'm rock climbing Sunday. How about coming along?
What?
Find anything interesting?
Why do you do that?
If I didn't know better, I'd say you were sulking.
Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.
Excuse me.
Edward...
Who is it?
Can't tell if you don't say please.
How high up would you say that is?
GET IN THE CAR!!
Can't we --
Bruce Wayne.  -- I've read your work.  I quite like it.
"This is Miss Vale." -- That felt redundant.
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even --
Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process.
Keep her on the line!
All right, Bruce, what do you suggest?
Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from Bruce Wayne -- We do have laws.
Okay, a break-in.  Trash the office, make off with the books ... "Industrial espionage."
I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist.  People might like to see the face behind the makeup.
How'd you know it was me?
Burned out.  I need a vacation.
Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
HOLY SHIT!!
Yes, there are hotels.  They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family.  Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
It's the last thing we need.
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
Liar.
It was nothing.  We're not ... He just makes me laugh.  When was the last time we laughed?  Any of us?
It wasn't a dream, was it.  I have to go in to work and tell them Whistler's Mother now looks like Danny De Vito.
It's very good Bernie.
And howls Alison?
Great day.  At last we can start getting out of debt and concentrating on the future.
What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds.  I'd like you to meet some of our staff here. .
I beg your pardon?
I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.
Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er ...
Very pleased you've taken him in, David.  At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
David, David, David ...
I owe you a very serious apology, young man.  It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this.  I sincerely hope that you do not.
A car sounds sensible.
Richard Burton was very good-looking.
Welsh.
They're pretty.  Learn it in the army?
Nope.
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Hey Butt-Head, why's that guy holding a sign?
Uh... Hey baby. Are we like, doing it?
Heh heh. We're in Washington!
This is dumb, let's find that chick.
That was boring. Huh huh.
Ow! Cut it out Butt-Head.
Whoa, my life is cool!
Uh... bye-bye.
Butt-dumpling...
Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
Oh yeah. Can you just take us to Washington? We're gonna meet her there and, you know, heh heh hmmm...
Yeah, heh heh. I'm gonna have money, and a big-screen TV and sluts everywhere!
You must bow down to the Almighty Bunghole.  Heh heh, this is cool.  Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!
Talk ta me, Bork.
Cavity search...?
Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...
Well, Earl said you guys were young, but jeez... Oh well, as long as you can get the job done. So what are your names?
Do her? Huh huh.
Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
Who sent ya?
You're doing it, Adam.  You're saving this town.
You'd better sit down, hon.
You saved my -- uh -- life... or whatever... something.
De<u>ceased</u>.  I don't know where it came from.
They make gypsies look good.
We're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  I'm going to talk to that little girl.
We don't know who he is...  ... I'm going to talk to that little girl.
Three times.  Powerful number.
The sushi?  I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?
He might have hurt somebody.
<u>Adam</u>!  Why did you build a whorehouse?  Have you ever been to...?
You Maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife.  So what's my cut?
Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad.
I heard.  Tore your face right off!  Bad news.  It obviously doesn't do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can't see you.
All right.  Who are you?
I'd nearly given up on you.  I was about to leave.  I do have other clients.
Are you Juno, our case worker?
-- Like you used to be?
He's a freelance bio-exorcist. Claims to get rid of the living. But he's a troublemaker.  He's pushy.  He's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
Minor problem.  The rules.  I can't tell it to you.  But... do you know how to play charades?
So... You're ready for me now?
W... What is it?
It's <u>Otho</u>!
I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan up here?  Hunan?
Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers.
Stepmother.
Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
Just a minute, Maxie.  Somebody...
Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese could <u>run</u> it for us.  Build them a dormitory in the woods.  Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you.
We'll be <u>the</u> art center of summer New York.  I'll teach those phony gallery creeps to refuse my sculpture.  And when Otho and I get through with this house, you people are not going to recognize it.
Is there much more of this torture?
Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
Hellooo!  How's school?
It's okay.  How's the dirt business?
Wait a minute!  What am I worried about?  Otho, you can't even change a tire!
Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's?
I'll send Wilson up to take you for X-rays, Mr. Gardiner. Feel free to use the telephone, and please let me know if you have any discomfort.
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
... No, of course you don't. Excuse me for being so presumptuous. No man knows everything about another man - however, very few are honest enough to admit it.
It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it.
A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.
At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.
Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?
Of course, Doctor, I understand.
Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers.
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
I agree.
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
No. I'm a gardener.
Won't your injury prevent you from attending to business, Mr. Gardiner?
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
Hello, Eve.
I know you are, Chauncey...  ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
Yes. I like to watch.
Yes. It's very good, Eve.
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy.
No. I'm not busy.
Yes, very well, thank you.
Yes, I do, it's very good.
I don't want Robert.
Oh, good.
I agree.
Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.
No, Ben.
Mr. Chance, I'm very pleased to meet you.
Yes.
What about money?
I am allowed to go to the attic and select any of the Old Man's suits. They all fit me very well. I can also take his shirts, shoes and coats.
This is terrible, sir -  I hope you're not badly injured...
Good morning, Louise.
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
Well, ain't that the truth...
I always find it surprising, Mr. Gardiner, to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the President, yet manage to remain relatively unknown.
No. I don't object.
Yes.
... We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts, the law firm handling the estate.
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
... You've quite a sense of humor, Mr. Chance - but all kidding aside, may I ask just what you are doing here?
... Joe? Who's Joe?
Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven years ago.
... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance?
Oh. I'm very sorry. Well, if you have any need for any of our facilities, please do not hesitate to ask.
Yes, ma'am.
Clearly, yes comrade.
Hmmm... Take this down.  I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes."'
Gardiner, yes, sir.
And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.
Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we'll keep on top of it, Mr. President - we'll come up with the answer.
... Mr. President, how good to see you.
I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
John! Great to see you! Sorry about the cunt at reception.
Okay.
Oh yeah, he's good.
Say, aren't you that actor guy?
I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get your autograph now? It's for .... oh, what the hell, it's for me! I'm your biggest fan!
Seven-ish
Hi.
The ferret?
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours.
Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
What?
You were him last night, weren't you?
And he was with her.
We?
It'll never happen, fuckface.
I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful.
You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
I know. I'm sorry...
Welcome to LesterCorp. May we meet your filing needs?
Schwartz.
Mr. Juarez?
I am a trained performer.
Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, "I can't understand a word any of you are saying."
One hundred and five. Carrot juice.  Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.
I'll keep that in mind, sir.
No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately.
I see. Are you unhappy at our little company?
You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am
That's the usual?
Don't you want to know what happened to me?
Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
Good. We'll sell tickets.
This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?
Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!
Have a seat. I wracking my brain over this Malkovich thing.
What kind of circumstances?
Do tell. I love a good plan.
Fine. Let's drop it.
Fork ah did?
Do you dream often?
It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy.
Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
Count me in.
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
I'm getting divorced.
Aaaahhhh, the portal!
Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad.  Hi, are you Craig's wife?
And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.
Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.
How do we do that?
Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.
Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
Yes. How did you know it was me?
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
Shut up!  Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.
This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen.
Sleepy suddenly.
Folks come. Folks go.
If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
You blaming God. That what you're doing?
Those white things have taken all I had or dreamed. I'm saying ain't no bad luck in this world 'cept for white folks..They just don't know when to stop.
You punishing Him, ain't you?
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
We have to be steady. "These things too will pass". What you looking for? A miracle?
Beloved..She's mine       I am Beloved
What do you know about it? I sleep where I want.
You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama.
Your mother all right?
Yes?
Well, if you want my opinion...
I don't. I have my own.
You know what? I've been here since I was fourteen and I remember like yesterday when Baby Suggs, holy, came here and sat right where you are. Whiteman name of Garner brought her. He and Mr. Bodwin were good friends. That's how she got that house you all live in. Other things too.
Yes ma'am.
In case of what?
Was over to Baby Suggs.
I know Denver.
I know what I see.
It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.
Why? Why he have to ask? Can't nobody offer? What's going on? Since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog?!
Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
That's so.
This is hard for me. But I got to do it. Two things I got to say to you. I'm a take the easy one first.
You remember your price, Stamp?
Never found out.
Leave off..
You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.
You got to get up from here, girl.
Don't you die on me!! This is Baby Suggs quilt. Is that what you planning!?
Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.
Uh-huh.
Hey hey, I'm not messing with your special lady--
She's not my special lady, she's my fucking lady friend.  I'm just helping her conceive, man!
Hey, man, I'm not--
The Gundersons.
There's no ransom if you don't have a fucking hostage.  That's what ransom is.  Those are the fucking rules.
Okay.  Vee take ze money you haf on you und vee call it eefen.
Don't need it.  We're scattering the ashes.
Yeah.
They posted the next round of the tournament--
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
This Saturday.  Quintana and--
I'm shomer shabbas.
Come on, Donny, they were threatening castration!
What have you.  We'll, uh--
Jesus, man, can you change the station?
And this is the study.  You can see the various commendations, honorary degrees, et cetera.
I'm not really, uh.
Heh-heh--
Yes, heh--
In the briefcase?
Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my papers.  Business papers.
And what do you do, sir?
Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern thing?
Hello, gentlemen.  You are the bereaved?
Oh that's okay, I hardly even--
Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor.
Hey man, why don't you fucking listen occasionally?  You might learn something.  Now I got--
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
So...that doctor.
Yeah man, it really tied the room together--
Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it is no dream.
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
Just for making the hand-off?
That...fucking...bitch!
Walter, face it, there isn't any connection.  It's your roll.
What the hell is this?
Walter, I'm sure there's a reason you brought your dirty undies--
Easy, Dude.
Walter!
What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said so yourself--
I told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling?
Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.
Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
Not if I have anything to say about it.
That makes me feel all warm inside.
Now Dude--
What're you, a fucking park ranger now?
He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--
The bulk of the series.
Uh-huh.
Is the car out front yours?
I understand.  That's why I picked up the phone.
Shit yeah!
Walter, come off it.  You're not even fucking Jewish, you're--
Yeah, and you were--
Oh, shit.
Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal, there never was any money.  The big Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, man, so take it up with him.
Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!
Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam anybody here, I'm just--
Is this a--what day is this?
Seems like he's doing me a favor, then.
Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
You've been training two years to take me out.  Here I am, the big, bad vampire hunter.  So do it.
No hemoglobin left. Their metabolisms are too fast.  They burn out.  That's why they're having to feed so often.  Their systems are self destructing.
If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
He's right about one thing.  We do have to survive.
For what?
You don't want to go there.
I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I do.  It's in my blood.
Eau de suckhead.  Tasty.
I would hate to think you were losing your perspective.  Who do you think God favors in the web?  The spider or the fly?
Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
From his father, of course.
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
Going on twenty years now.
Yeah, your little cootchie knew.
Whistler!
She's been bitten.
I had to increase the dose. You're building up a resistance to the serum --
Don't try to talk --
No longer.
I am tired. Dawn is coming.
You shouldn't be here.
I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
And that's a good thing?
So many of them -- I still can't believe they're real.
I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts I wasn't human.
Is he sick?
It won't work on you.
The red blood cells are biconvex, which is theoretically impossible. They're hypochromic, there's virtually no hemoglobin in them.  Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, they should be mononucleated.
You haven't started in on the internal organs?
I see. And what would you have us do with this "half-breed"?
Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which, of course, they do.
LaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a spirit, requiring a flesh and blood host in order to manifest himself.
Who are you people?
So what do you use, then? A stake?
I wouldn't go in there if I were you. It's best to leave him alone when he's like this.
All right, let's start with the basics -- why do vampires need to drink blood?
I don't...I don't understand them myself.
What, are you alright?
--Jamie Kurth, Jonathan Edmunds--
--stop it! Stop talking about it! I'm gonna freak!
Let's talk to your husband--
Shit? This is from "Josh's Blair Witch Mix," man!
Whatzername--the "psychic" Anna hired.
Jesus.
No, the kids were actors, the townspeople were real. Her, the Sheriff, the Convenience Store guy--
Your parents didn't have a <u>bigger</u> one?
Let's just leave it at: it was one hell of a surprise.
Why is there no "our" here?
I don't know. Nightmare.
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
Just now?
No.
Whatever you want.
<u>Before</u> 5:00--
<u>This</u> is what you wanted enhanced?
I can't.
There, what? I didn't see anything.
Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.
Whatta you got, telescopic vision?
Yeah. Me too.
We're not making Blair Witch II here.
Either way, maybe there's a book in it, and they both make a ton of money.
Let's get inside.
Just one lock in this neighbor- hood?
Running a junk yard.
Just hold on!
Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.
We're doing dusk-till-dawn taping of all the places where there've been alleged Blair Witch "sightings" --the Parr House, Coffin Rock, Tappy Creek.
Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack, something.
For a blur?
What is it you thought you saw on that tape?
Slow it down, slow it down, whatever it is, we'll figure it out.
Get some more beer.
I'm sorry.
Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
Who <u>is</u> this??
...Ray?
You can stay at my place, I'll drop you there.
...You called me this morning.
What happened?--Was Meurice there?
...That's the only thing they told us in the service that was worth a goddamn--Where the hell's my windbreaker?
I... I mean what're you talking about, Ray? I haven't done anything funny.
You've got a very sophisticated palate.
What?
...I don't know. Sometimes I think there's something wrong with him. Like maybe he's sick? Mentally?... Or is it maybe me, do you think?
If the pay's right I'll do it.
You want me to kill 'em.
Yeah. Is it...
...What?
Dead, huh?
Don't throw that out.
Deuce in the corner needs help.
The point is we don't serve niggers here.
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
Tuesday.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
The criminals are winning.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
Okay?
No. not at all.
Not yet.
Where are we going, Frank?
Hey. Tits. I'm taking your neighbor to the country. maybe something for you too.
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
Frank gone?
Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
GET OUT OF THERE!! GET OUT!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name?. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
Do you like that?
Don?
Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
No. how could he?. Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  . don't hate me.
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
Whatiya mean?
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Okay. I know you've been scared. now you want to scare someone.
Come on Dorothy.
Men are crazy. then they put their craziness into me. then it makes me crazy. then they aren't so crazy for awhile. then they put their craziness in me again.  . it's burning me. but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
I'm glad you do.
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. there is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. in every hole. It's opening me to a death.
They hurt his head.
On a ride.
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet. straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
Yes.
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin' beer.
There ya go.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
No. this has been going on for some time . several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body. only parts.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Are you alright?
Here's to. an interesting experience.
Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?
Could you wait a little while. this key may not fit.
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
You want to tell me about it?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
You were late.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret.
Oh my God. What's wrong?
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
Nothing. I'm fine.
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
No. No thank you.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. real good.
Where do you guys want to count?
The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire.  He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point.
You happy, baby?
Should we buy it?
Are you kidding?
Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that.
Baby, you didn't have to come.
Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years.  I'll serve two.
Two years.  George, I can't wait that long.
Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon, correct?
Excuse me?
I see.  How much?
What can I do for you guys?
The way we figure it, Barbara flies to Boston twice a week.  Two bags per flight.  Twenty-five pounds in each bag.
And I only deal with you?
George?  You better get yourself a good lawyer this time.  We're gonna nail your ass to the wall on this one.
No?
Twenty-six months.
No, my brother.
George?  What do you know about cocaine?
How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
But you must.  It's the only way.
I just got released five minutes ago.
I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
Where do I put this!?
Are you comfortable with this?
Take it easy!  Everything's okay!
I just can't get over the size of that ring.  I just love it.  Fred, look at it.  Tell me you don't love that ring.
Yeah.  Nice.
The man in the garden.  He was full of courage.
But, never mind.  I am thinking we can do much together.  This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business.  To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem.  And I don't like problems.
Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you.  It is the teacher.
I'm sorry, George.
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
What are you going to do?
I know.
You loved her, didn't you?  You really loved her.
I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great.
Money.  You and your mother.  All the time chasing it.  I never understood it.
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
I guess I kind of lost sight of things. "May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face, and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars."  Love, George.
I meant every word of it.
Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing cocaine" sign on the car.  What is your fucking problem?
Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love her, y'know?  I kind of want to have her.  I've been away for so long.  Make up for the missed time, you know?
Yeah.
You swear?
That's right.  Three o'clock.  Thursday. At your mother's.  You and me.  It's a date.
I don't believe you.
I swear.  On my life.
Swear on my life.
Shhhh.
But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow.  My daughter.
Do you see him here in the courtroom?
Very nice.  I'll take it.
I don't need a little.  I need a lot.
Well, I'll tell you.  I was walking down the beach, minding my business, when who did I see but this fucking guy.  I didn't know you guys were living in California.
Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!
This is bullshit, George.  We're never going to find anything down there.
Look around. I've put everything at your disposal. Go take a look with your own eyes.
Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers, but also of the methods that they have employed ... Can you tell us something about this?
I understand. What's your question?
The law is often inconvenient, colonel ...
Sid Ahmed.
Second district, Casbah, West Algiers.
What's happened to you?
What ... What must I decide?
Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
Why? Isn't he sleeping here?
It's ten minutes past midnight. Curfew begins at midnight.
Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
Before you ask there's nothing new on the coke.
You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie.
Take some time off.
About three hours.
What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?
No.
Is this the bottle that was found on the nightstand?
Yes.
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use cocaine?
Lookin' to make the papers, John?
She planned this.  She wanted us to find the nasal spray.
She's innocent.
Your Honor, I fail to see what Mrs Crawford's educational background has to do with this case.
Objection, Your Honor.  The fact that Mrs. Crawford heard Mr. Troxell reconstruct her sentence and decided to rephrase her words in a more intelligent manner for the court doesn't mean the incident never happened.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston listed as a prosecution witness.
Were you aware of Mr. Marsh's heart condition?
Yes.
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
Is it Marsh?
Who found him?
She didn't.  She just left.
What happened after that?
Yes -- several times.
Why?
Yes -- Insulin and others.
Don't you see what she's doing?  She needs you to kill me.  She's planned it that way from the start.  That's why she phoned me tonight.
Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?
Why does she come to you?
I tell them to pour an amount the size of a quarter into the their hand and mix it with water.
I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there.
-- And what did Dr. Paley do after you stopped seeing him?
What did he say?
No.
Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death?
Yes, I slept with him but that was a long time ago.
I'm a practical woman Mr. Dulaney. Killing Andrew wasn't in my best interest.  As it is I'm out of a job and I'm not in his will.
In his previous will Mr. Marsh left you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars -- then he cut you out.  Why do you think he did that?
Well - I'm a little confused.  This is a charge receipt from Rosen's Drug Store where Mr. Marsh had an account.  It's dated the day of the murder.  Is this your signature?
There's an item you picked up that's marked.  Will you read it?
Dristan nasal spray.
You take what people say and make it ugly.  You make others believe what you want them to.  She should have been found guilty.  She shouldn't have gotten off.
Then you would have gotten your money?
Hi, Joe.
Yes.
Do you think I did it?
I want you to know right now that the trial's going to be nasty.  Your sex life is going to be dragged through the mud.  They're going to say that you enticed Marsh -- led him down a dark path.
Those same men will be sitting on the jury.
I thought the subject was sex?
As it pertains to you -- not me.  Did you always know you had different... tastes?
-- And then?
Because, I'm your attorney.  I shouldn't be going to your house.
Is it against the law?
Great.  I'll see you at the office at nine.
It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
There's nothing wrong in admitting that you want me, Frank.
Can I see you later?
You're a monster.
No -- he's lying.
We've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet. Cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten.  I'd like you to go with her.
Well, that's kind of how I am right now.
I know what day it is!  Get off the phone.
No, Your Honor.
Objection.  The witness has already stated that Miss Lawson left without an explanation.
The witness will answer the question.
I can back it up.
I'll talk to him later.
You wouldn't like what you'd see. You don't know me anymore.  I don't know me anymore.
You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
It's more involved than that.
Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
No -- never.
SO!
I don't mind waiting.
Well, I can help.
I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me years ago she died.
I can't believe she's making jokes.
Bar across the street.
She's changed.
No. What a tragedy. What happened?
After the divorce.
Oh.
Well, thank you for all your help, Mrs. Johnson.
Lemon?
I'm so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason.
Where are you staying while you're here?
No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.
Much.
I better go. You sure you're all right?  It's been a pleasure. Sincerely.
I feel so embarrassed.
I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
No. I'll do them later.
What?
You must get lonely at times.
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
That's not what you're saying. I know it's not the same. What you're saying is, it's not as good. Or it's not as normal or proper.
No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was an inappropriate thing to ask.
Oh.
I uh... I had lunch in town today. Happened to cross paths with "that Redfield woman." I apologize. I thought you were half-joking about that.
Sure.
Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them.
I had a temper.
Sleep all right?
Yes, thanks.
What?
You have no idea what you've done to me, do you? And after you leave, I'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in Romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.
No one's asking you to!
No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?
But now that you have it -
No. Don't do this.
What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon?
I said to him Cary you're being ridiculous. You're more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
'Bout 4:30.
Think for a second. Is there someplace she said she wanted to go?
They're not going to find her!
Your mother left explicit instructions that she wished to be cremated.
Boys and girls, Moms and Dads.  Children of all ages, I'd like you to meet... Jimmy Bones.
You soundin' like the old man now.
Where's the gangsta of love?
You got a nice crib here.
But a two dollar bet is cheaper than a twenty-dollar bag.
Just try it.
I said, no thanks.
My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
Jimmy, you've got --
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
How did you get in here?
You got a vision, girl.  Just like I got. Just like my momma had.  And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures.  That's just wasted time.
Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.
In his grave there was a cloth or a dress or something.  Covered with blood.
That place is already bad luck.
Lucky thing.
And you believe her?
Did you do it?
You were just a kid.
Please...help me...
No way man...
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
Fair enough for the shit.  But I think a little bonus is due for knocking out the competition.
"Like a heartbeat/Like a love beat." Listen to the Di Franco twins there. Just the plumbing or something, fool.
That building?
I was born near here.  But after my mother died, my dad moved.  I grew up out in Rossmore Park.
Well, the bad news is we only made 25 bucks each.
Evidence of what?
Glenlivet, right, Gino?
I think you're fucking crazy!
Where is it?
Not bad.  What for?
That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
Caesar, I'm leaving.
What are you going to do with it?
They were early.
You mean they weren't up here?
What?
But you know he did it.
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
I got it!  I know what I got to do! I got to get the money.
All right, Johnnie, you want to play it this way, I can play it this way. You want to know who made a mistake, why don't you open the case.
Caesar, what are you going to do?
Caesar, what are we going to do?
Where, then?
I had to.  You made me.
We were in a car accident --
Good.  I hate to worry.  I got ulcers.
My brushes, I have to clean my brushes.  Thanks, though.
No.
You can't kill me yet.
See?  We're for real.
This is a beautiful place.
Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools.
So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
Thanks.
He said you lost something.
You seem uncomfortable.  Do I make you nervous, Corky?
Maybe.
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
Basically.
The redistribution of wealth?
We're not that different, Corky.
All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex.  Not real sex. But they're wrong.  I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.
What about that guy this morning?
He hung it up.
Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
Gino Marzzone is coming to your apartment.  It's a big deal, isn't it?  That means Caesar will be ready. He doesn't want to look like an idiot. Gino has been there before?
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
You can't know for certain that he won't see you.
That's okay, as long as he believes it was Johnnie.
No.
Done.  We go now.
You're asking me a direct question?
I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
...they won't let you go...
So it's time to go home.
Yes, I'm here...
Yes.  Is he there?
You are a friend of his?
There was an accident.  On the motorway.  Apparently, he was killed instantly.  Really, I'm terrible sorry to be the one to tell you this...
...we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened. When they came for his things, it was made known for us, you see?

Please.  I don't want to scare you.
It's a little late for that.
Jesus...
I said ten thousand.
You could buy a car for twenty grand.  You could buy this car.
I won't hurt you.
What if I say no?
Shit --  Can I tell you how much you're freaking me out?  Okay?  Because you are -- you're completely freaking me out.
I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like?
No.
What are you talking about?
I should go.
Okay, so...
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?
-- just --
He came to kill us.
Oh, Jesus...
-- forget it --
You stayed there five times in the past six months.  But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days.  Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth--
What does that mean?  Jason, what does that mean?  Jason, please...who is he?
I don't know. 
-- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? --
-- Miss Kreutz, please --
Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
Where am I?
Mumble ... mumble ... mumble ... Tuttle
What? You mean you've got ...
I'm waiting for my daddy.
Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old fashioned virtues. They just can't stand seeing the other fellow win. If these people would just play the game, instead of standing on the touch line heckling -
Too late? That's for me to say.
Remember how they used to stick out?
I don't want to take up your time now, but I was hoping you could give me some information on somebody. It's a security level three matter and Information Retrieval records says to refer to you.
Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one. If you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense.
How much do you know?
Christ! You do know it all!
I'm sure you have
Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
Out of kindness.
Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?
There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
You stupid bastard!
I want to report a wrongful arrest.
Is it stamped?
Stamped?
Where do I get it stamped?
Them?
... This is amazing ... for me ... being here with you. I mean, in my dreams you ...
I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams!
You know, smoking's bad for you.
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.
What's going on here?
OK. What's in the parcel?
It's heavy.
No, really.
You're joking.
I thought you arrested me.
Shit! The house is on fire!
Perhaps the machine's on the blink! It keeps picking up old films. That can't he right, can it?
Information Retrieval.
I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion from the word go! He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!
I've never seen a Ministry cheque before.
Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque?
You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you?
Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! 
Sam Lowry.
I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something
This is your dream girl, is it?
Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The bandages came of this afternoon. Come and join the fun. Everybody's here.
Sam!!! 
Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists?
There was a slight complication. Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. Nothing to worry about. He's promised me I'll have these bandages off in a ...
Numero huit, braised veal in wine sauce. 
Thank you for calling Central Services. I am sorry, due -
Hello ... hello ...
Hello. Mr Lowry?
Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me through to Mr Helpmann's office?
Are you expecting anyone?
Thank you very much. How much will it...?
I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better than that, I'll forward you some sick time. A week, two weeks off-- how about that?
No English. She has terrible pain in her belly.
Pregnant.
No, no, that's impossible.
Is she dying?
She's having a baby. Twins.
Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
Frank Pierce.
I was tired. I needed a coffee.
Don't worry, hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me.
All right, all right, he's been snorting that Red Death stuff. Been going for four days.
Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked.
Yes?
He wants to pull that tube out. It's pretty painful--that's why they keep him sedated--but it's a good sign.
He's better.
It's best not to ...  It's good pizza, huh?
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
I wish these people would leave already. I can't listen to another story. Did you see him?  That doctor says the brain is coming around. They're waiting for the heart to stabilize. I don't know who to believe. He says they still have to keep him tied up.
The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
Went over to Sal's got this. There must be some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I call you if anything comes up.
Backup?
I'll drink to that.
How many times have you shocked him tonight?
Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso.
What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
Look at that. Tell me that's a crazy person. Every move is calculated. He knows exactly what he's doing. This is the guy. I've been after him for weeks. He's quick, runs like a rat, tough for one person, but with two of us--
Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
Frank!
Do it!
Turn it off.
Tell me, you ever think of doing anything else?
This is uncomfortable for me -- because, well, I don't mean it as a knock, but we approach this differently.
You were smokin' toward the end there.
Everybody has one like that.  I thought it was great when you started to laugh at the end.
Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
You know what I...
At six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic.
I didn't sleep.  They're giving me less and less air time.  They don't think I'm at all anchor material.
Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
Aaah --  -- ello.  You sure they said the management meeting?  They want me to be at the management meeting.
As good as humanly possible.
Do you feel good about it?
Then what was good about it?
Why not try it for a few weeks?
Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too -- he couldn't help.  My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland.  The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks.  Personally, I think he should aim higher.
Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...
You are now required to sit here with me.  Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?
Really?
So who's the guy?
I saw the smile -- good piece.
Just tell me what's really going on.  I think we know each other well enough for me to expect that.
Okay.  I think I'd better be alone for a while.
Move away from me.
This is a brutal layoff...And all because they couldn't program Wednesdays.
Tell George and Jessica to try and cover everything without Tom having to ask additional questions.
I've been doing some morning show stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't bother me.  I'm in no rush for anything.  It's just the snotty attitude, even if I have it coming, it's still...
Bad manners.
Yes, it's true.  They're going to make it public Wednesday but isn't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early?
Yes.  How do you know?
Thanks a lot, Buddy.
Nobody else had it.
Look, I can start up with him again if you really...
Nooo.  This way the rotation stays the same.
Tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him.  Not near ready.  Not by the longest shot.  Aaron's spent six weeks in Tripoli, he's interviewed Gaddafi -- he reported on the Eight-one story.  I think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and I think it's my responsibility to tell you that.
Come on...Even I'm not that hard on myself.
What about the obvious remedy? Reversing things.  Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.
I never told you the reason I was telling you everything for.
I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not here to teach remedial reporting.
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
It's the firs time I've seen you dressed like this.  You look so clean and pretty.
At work there's always this sort of film over you.
Nervous?
Jane?
Jennifer, you want to have another drink?
Come on, I'll buy you a drink. There's a big thing over at the Italian embassy.
Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
What?
I'm not sure I dialed right -- Jane?
I had to sleep fast so I took two allergy pills to help me...I'm sorry...Hey, you called me.
Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
No.  Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
You're not going to take off on me, are you?
Hi.  It's me.
I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway.  I should get some sleep.
I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's verboten, huh?  I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you.  That's not the reason you're not coming?
It just proves that the difference we have are...
I knew what you meant.
I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything.
You're saying stay away from him.
I sure know that feeling.  Terrific work today.
The last time I was with someone we went through this awful mutual disease questionnaire but I guess it beats getting paranoid the next day.  Okay, I'll go first.  I haven't...
Yes, I'm sorry.
Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
It's kind of dark -
I've never seen anything like this, maybe Segal, but nothing with such... dichotomy...  It's very good, Walter -
Great!  What is it?
Are you ready?
Nice night out...
I like you very much, Walter.
That's word for word.
I'm trying to find a style of my own.  Do you really like them?
Are you trying to be funny?
Nothing...nothing at all.
Don't ask.
That's the idea, Walter.  It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
Now what kind of statue was that?
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
Yeah.
Yes they are, aren't they?  Look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.
It's hot in here...
You better hold off on the bubbly.
I tried to contact you by phone but I couldn't...
Yes, you have.  Can I come in?
I- don't know what you're talking about!
Don't give me a hard time Walter! You don't want to get me mad!  You're coming with me!
Did you like it Mister Brock?
Why on Earth should you be so depressed?  Have you heard some of the things they've been saying? You can make fifty thousand on these pieces alone!
Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker.
T-tell him that?
What's wrong with you!?!
I like it.  Can I be your friend?
Booo!
Get away from here.
Did you see a girl come by here?
Have you gained a few pounds?  Maybe it's that outfit...
Hey there.
Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look beat.
Oh, come on, Buffy.  You know what's going on.  It's not working out at all.  I've got to move on.  I mean, I've got needs, too.  I told you about all this.
Is that your car?
Do you do this kind of thing a lot? I mean, is this like a hobby?
Not exactly.
Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my mom's room if you want.
Who?
I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
I crashed your party.
Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
Am I in trouble or something?
What are you talking about?
To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
Just stay away from me, okay?
Why do you keep saying that?
All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?
No.  You don't do anything.  I do it.
But you threw a knife at my head!
Put your head back.
You are such a wet.
Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it.  Your fate.
I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
I find it restorative, sleeping in the life-blood of so many.  To feel their souls coursing about me.
Listen, you little worm.  I could beat your head to a pulp for you, just like I did last year, you got that?  You got that?
She didn't even hardly talk to anyone in school.  All year.  She didn't even go to the prom.
Well, I hope so.
What happened?
They'll kill us!
The homelesses?
Oh, yeah!
You know, just because you're having full-on wiggans doesn't mean you have to drag us into it.  This isn't just any dance.  It happens ot be the last dance of our last year.
Except for Prom.
I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
No...  You want me to give him a message?
All right.  Take care of yourself.
You said "Crash".
You said "Crash".
Just do what I say.  Now, which nostril are you breathing through?
I can't keep up with you.  First you say sex is gonna make me a better pitcher--now no sex is gonna do it?!
You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter?  We better not fuck.
Get over here.
I knew it--you're seducing me!
He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.
He did?
You don't have to...
Well I guess this is it.
Five hours.  We both just know.  Do you think I deserve to wear white?
These are the ground rules.  I hook up with one guy a season-- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy--kinda my own spring training...  And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far.  So...  I thought we should get to know each other.
I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
I crossed the street--it was the New York Yankees spring training field--tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat-- and I sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother...  And I saw him.
Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to.  Lately I'm not so sure.
There  might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring.
Yeah...you a witch?
You think I could make it to the Show as a manager?
Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
What's that?
You a God damn witch?
No!  I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!
You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
Hey!  What're you guys doing here-- stealing my girl?
Fun?  What's he know about fun?  Why's he calling for a curveball? I wanta bring heat.
"To announce your fucking presence with authority"?  This guy's a first ball fastball hitter.  He's looking for heat.
But he ain't seen my heat--
It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
I love winning, Crash, you hear me?  I love It.  Teach me everything.
She's getting steamed 'cause I'm still re-channeling my sexual energy--maybe I should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down.  What'ya think?
I'm going to the Show.
C'mon, we got nothin' to fight about.
No.
Sorry about last night.
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?
Fear and ignorance.
Crash Davis?
We want you to room with him on the road and stay on his case all year.  He can go all the way.
She's playing with my mind.
No.  The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.
Little high.
He's got a million dollar arm and a five cent head.
Eight and twenty-four.
Eight and twenty-four!  How'd we ever win 8 games?
What the hell's going on out there?
Who ain't?
Thank you.
What are you talking about?
I'm a little in shock, quite frankly...
You were never my guest?!
Uh, I - I'd... I'd like to answer - answer that at this time.
But what happens when they do find out?
It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.
These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from -
She's my wife.  Look at me. You did know that, didn't you? You knew that she's my wife? Huh? Hey, look at me.
You understand? Put her on the fuckin' phone.
Right away.
Right back.
Yeah, we made a great pair. I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected. The old men loved us. And why not? They all made money with us.
While I was tryin' to figure out why the guy was sayin' what he was sayin', Nicky just hit him. No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on. You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat. You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun. And you beat him with a gun, you better kill him, because he'll keep comin' back and back until one of you is dead.
...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim.
I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that.
...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He was a real restaurant buff. And over the years, he always made money with them.
- no matter where he was or what he was doing, he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky- Boy.
You think he got the point?
What're you doin'? He's a square guy, for chrissakes.  You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the FBI.
Fuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you?  All of a sudden, you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time.
No, I don't wanna come -
Just say so.
What happened to me? What happened to you?
My wife?
All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.
Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that.
Peekaboo, you fucks, you.
No, a...
Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. It's not yours, it's my ass.
I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?!
Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you.
...you? Do you remember what I told you?
Ginger called me.
She was afraid to call you.
How'd you know I was here?
Mr Rothstein...  I'm Pat Webb.
Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
No problem.  Sorry.
You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?
Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?
Okay. You come by the house?
Ace, listen to me.
Why is she eight pounds over?
But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.
Who's this?
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
I - I - I...
You all right?
Oh, it's so soft.
Okay.
Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.
Hey, do you want to see this one? Daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much.  Put your arm in there.
Yeah.
Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it?  That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that?
I don't need one.
I mean she's only sober about two hours a day. It's usually from eleven in the morning until one in the afternoon. And if I gave her her money and her jewels now, you know what she's gonna do? She's gonna piss it all away in about a year, and then where will she be?  Where would you be then? Comin' right back to me, right back to me.  Or finding some other excuse to come and I - I -
Hi, it's me.  Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
And...
Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.
Yeah.
Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your fuckin' guts!
I am not! She's my daughter too! Goddamn you!
I mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door?  Are...
Now you need approval from him to go home?
You get down here!
I'm afraid to let her in the house.
I am calm!
Yeah, thanks for not callin' me a liar. You son-of-a-bitch. You son-of- a
Four reels, sevens across, three fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots? Do you have any idea what the odds are?
Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?
Yeah.
Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
Yes.
There's nothing we can do. She had the key.
Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
Is that what you did?
I think, you know, maybe he went across the street or somewhere else or somethin'. I don't know.
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
What?
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -
Hey, Frankie.
...I want all the names of all the other people he had with him. And I don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. You understand?
I know.
Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? Because if he is... it's a problem.
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
You see... I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. You understand?
Yeah.
And take it easy with this shit, will you? I mean, this can only make matters worse.
Oh, come on.
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
I'm not as tough as you think I am.
Is that what you want?
Oh, well, then, have him killed and get it over with.
What about my money?
All right. Be careful.
Lester - he called you here.
It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem, you know.
No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy -
- back to  Nigeria.  Yeah.
I think that's it.
Look, there aren't...  There aren't but...
Yeah.
Get up.
Come here, come here.
She asleep?
I took care of everybody.
...Remo and the guys used to hang out and count their millions.
I do all the work. Somebody don't like it, fuck him.
Oh, he ain't nobody.
Angelo and Buster.
Yeah.
Calm down, calm down. Shh!
Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!
Kill me, you fuck, kill me.
I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it.
You're a little confused?
Yeah.
...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
I know it, I know it.
You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
Nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out..
But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.
I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."
Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
What a "drag."
Sorry man, I didn't mean that personally...
Well, we spent enough time building the damn thing, might as well use it.
Well, you don't see that everyday. Somebody tell me what's the deal with Frida Kahlo here?
You like them, don't you, Boss.
You're not a super-hero. You're not even a hero. You're a scary, sick, fake who made a big mistake. You killed someone very special to me..
Hasn't anyone ever taught you that fighting violence with violence solves nothing.
Can't you understand--I got tired of being a woman. I wanted the respect that only a cape, boots, chestplate, and a mechanical spear can bring..
Oh no, not a computer disc. A computer disc?  Oh man, come on, what do I look like?  I'm not a crime- fighter, I'm not a detective, what, I'm supposed to find some "clues" on this disc. I can't...
You know, my name's not Spooky. It's, it's Rachel.
"Pre-bicentennial babe?"
Oh Frank, I'm not anti-male, I'm anti- you. Believe me, there's a difference.  Kelly is designing new uniforms for next week. Pay her and thank her. And is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning.  There's something out there called 73 degrees, look into it.
A genuine woman of mystery in Oasisburg.  Amnesia. Bulletholes in exposed stomach badly concealed with body make-up.  Beautiful, intelligent eyes that have no business in "Frank's Fun Palace" or anybody else's Fun Palace for that matter..
Oh the hand--my grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender and..You know, I realize I've never officially introduced myself...I'm Lewis Lane.
Ah!  You scared me!  How did you know to come here!  Have you been spying..
Yes, you shouted the words "Captain God" at me for no reason...
But I'm blind.
A hearty breakfast is the start of a great morning...
Mom?  Oh Mom, I messed up...
I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...you have such pretty eyes...
I know.  But it's an emergency. Somebody dying.  Okay?
I'm sorry for whatever's happened to you but we're definitely not the right people to do you any good.
Don't you have children?
Taking messages.
What if they do question the authenticity?
Oh.  Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
What was that for?
We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
And stop with the directions.
Let's hope so.  Once you come out and okay everything I'll give Caitlin the sign that she can bring the painting on over.
Don't fuck around.  Pop a cap in him.
Oh won't I?
Don't lay this on me!
Why would anybody want to hurt you?
I'm with two friends now.
Stop throwing names at me.
I kind of dropped them off.  They were getting on my nerves.
Tell me what she looks like.
Where's the fucking recharger cord?  Must be in her car, dammit.
There are cables overhead.  Hang on.  It'll clear up.
Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
It's not your fault, Theo.  You tried.
Wait just a minute.  Our luck has changed.
I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.
To hide it from the I.R.S.
Theo, I want you to know, you're probably the most decent man I've ever met.
Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
Are you okay?
She's next.  In two or three more minutes she'll be free.
Don't start thinking about it.  Is the tape off?
They won't allow that.  It's one at a time.  And you have to be first.
You're going to let them get away with this?
We've almost got your husband and your daughter out.  So don't get any ideas.
The video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and I'll bet there were enough witnesses.
At least one.
L.A.P.D.
Absolutely.  And Topanga Canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if I recall.
A typical fuck-up.
What's that supposed to me?
You could've hit me.
Did you hear that?
Twenty percent.
Fine.  I want half.  Plus the release of the family.
You're making it too easy.
Take my number.  When you see me -- call me and I'll walk you through the exchange.  It's 308-9962 -- Repeat it back.
I still don't see you.
You should've done all this before.
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
Stop the crying.
Don't worry.
And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
I thought you'd know me by now.
How far off are you?
Five minutes.
Where's the backpack?
Probably as close to the Getty as I'll ever come.  Unless you care to be my "patron," Nels.  You wouldn't be the first successful thief to become a patron of the arts.
Was I picking on you?  How come you pulled in back of this fruitstand?
You sure know how to take a lot of punishment.
So who's he?
See what, Dil?
What you think?
An excellent quality.
Who the fuck is he?
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
Fuck off back to Essex!
Everybody wants something.
Now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane.
Now's the time you're meant to do something, isn't it?
No --
Why?
Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon.
Will you meet me again?
Are you pretending yet?
Should have stayed a girl.
What?
Not at all, honey.
Dil, this is Jude.
What's her?
Afraid so.
And you wouldn't leave me?
No.
You promise?
You want to make me look like him...
What pills?
Are you supposed to take that many?
Yes.
I got the order to shoot him. Before I could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and died.
You killed my Jody?
In a manner of speaking.
Got to be somewhere.
And you'll never leave me?
What's Fergus?
Yes.
Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
Sorry, love. Now, the white ones are magnesium supplement --
I'm sorry, darling. I keep forgetting the leap year. What am I supposed to call you then, Jimmy?
Don't go looking for it, Dil.
Fergus!
Can't.
Eddie and Tinker died.
I know.
Yes.
Leave her out of this.
Perfect.
Why would you do that?
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
Who is he?
Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in.
How did you know it was her?
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
Why did you sign up?
Shouldn't take it personally.
"Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No use telling them I came from Tottenham.
Well, in Antigua cricket's the black man's game. The kids play it from the age of two. My daddy had me throwing googlies from the age of five. Then we moved to Tottenham and it was something different.
Fergus?
Yeah?
What do you believe in?
I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
When I was a child...
I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things...
You stupid bastard --
The teddy bear?
The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.
You greenhorn -- you half-witted, thick-skulled, hare-brained, greenhorn! They wuz both too smart for us!
What are you talking about?
All that marvelous rejection -- you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money.
What about it?
Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.
Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- it's got to be something around here.
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
Very sweet.
Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that!  Oh, dear.
Oh, I see.
But I don't have it.
Here's where you're to call me -- day or night. It's a direct line to both my office and my apartment. Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me. It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself.
Oh.
You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!
Describe him.
Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really.
Caf.
C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
That's a face you don't forget -- he was there too --
Well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then.
If you do anything funny, or try to talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- here and now. Okay?
What now?
Very pretty. Now what?
Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that.
And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?
He's just tryin' to throw us off! They've got it, I tell you! Why don't we search their rooms?
Yes, but we're divorced.
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
Why not a lying Blackfoot?
Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me.
What are you doing?
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, I see.
Who do you think did it -- Gideon?
Maybe.
Don't worry, I'm not going to hit you.
What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.
Yes, I know.
The suit needs it more than I do, anyway.
I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so?
Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
There sure ain't nothin' here worth no quarter of a million.
Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
Yes.
About how wealthy would you say?
I don't know.
"My dear Regina: I hope you are enjoying your holiday. Megeve can be so lovely this time of year. The days pass very slowly and I hope to see you soon. As always, Charles. P.S. Your dentist called yesterday. Your appointment has been changed."  Not very much, is it?
Is that all? Can I go now?
But he is gone.
It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
I don't know -- how would I know?
Oh. I guess.
Shakespeare never said that.
I rang the bell but I don't think it's working.
I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
Hallo, Peter.
I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me.
That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
I wouldn't take that too seriously.
Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
No -- no, I'm don't.
Isn't there something constructive he can do -- like start an avalanche?
a alors! From Charles?
Who is it from?
The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
I think it's funny.
You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight.
ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?
Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.
It's almost ten o'clock.
You said that two weeks ago.
Hi honey.
What do you mean?
Are you sure?
You know her?
You found her?
No?
What happened?
I can.
No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her?
You're the killed.
You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . .
I won't.
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
Yeah. I think it's really sick.
Why?
Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose.
If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it.
You break up with me because I won't fuck you.
What?
You can ask me anything.
No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
Where are you going?
They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
Kenny's aunt?
Did you want one?
I said no.
Unfair?!
 Oh...
Well, he told me to collect cash.
Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
Why don't I--?
...ya?
...truck.
What did you do that for?  It makes him mean as a snake.
That dog ain't mean.
I'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. I'm gonna--  Don't tell me to shut-- It's none of your business.  Man, I can talk all I want to.
We can't push old Pete in this heat.  He can't take it.
 
...-damn!


Kiss my ass!
 No...
...you.
 Yeah...
Back up!  Back...
  Oh, we're screwed, Night...
Oh, shit.
Come on, old Pete.
Come on, old Pete.  Oh.
 ...shit!
Okay.
You're--?  What?!
Then stay...
Uh-oh.
This thing just went up a degree.  Ice cream's not workin'.
...-tion?
...truck.
So I took his truck, yeah.
...-er.  It was your friend...
...miles.
...or my conscience.

They're takin' off.
They're movin'.
Hey, hey, hey.
We're gonna die, and you want me to do some freaky shit like that?!

You just can't leave that stuff with that lu-...
...-ful?!
And Brynner's right on...
...tunnel!
What the--?
 What's it say? 
Mason.
What?
Well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway!

You did help a little.
Who drove the ice cream...
...I feel that my government owes me a little restitution.
Patriotism is its own reward.
Thank you very much.
It all started with our mission in Istanbul.
Yeah.
We're worried...
I urge you to be persuasive.
It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five.
You-You can't let him...
Look, this is a scientific experiment, okay?
...destroyer of worlds."

You'll kill us all!
You look fit...healthy...
Is that why you're here?  To blame...
I know where the  blame belongs.  But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew.  The government did...
Oh, I'm well aware of what the government did, I assure you.  Actually, I've just come to say how grateful I am to you...

...maybe even Salt Lake, not to mention Casper...
...here!
Dutiful citizens, you have something which I have waited years for.
All right.  Tell the pilot we'll be a half-hour.
Carl, establish contact with that deputy we met earlier.  He'll be more useful now.


Check the immediate area.
I'm Colonel Brynner, U.S. Special Operations Com-...
...-mand out of Fort Bragg.
We were called in by the Jerome base...
...-ty.
I assume you want that to go.
I beg your pardon?
Actually, I was just looking for a restroom.
Not tonight...
Contrary to what Dr. Long may have told you, this is neither...
Because if you don't give me that cylinder, your lives will end...



Dead, last time I...
Oh, you're two of a kind, doc.  Oh, he may not have your sheepskins, and...
Go.
...now!
Colonel, sir, who the hell is this guy?
Gomez, you fight the battles you can win.  Now, we've been outmaneuvered here.  Brynner's next move is gonna be to get Elvis out of the country and sell him to the highest bidder.  To do that, he has to have planned an exit point.  That's where we intercept him.  That's where we make our play.  Now you and your men back off.
There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.
...like a fish.
Tie a fly...
...without caution...
...is death.
Some people might say you're readin' an awful lot in-...
...fishin'.
Mason.
Shit!  Oh, shit. 
 ...or it'll ignite. 
Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees.
Mr. Sweeney, how goes it?
Dr.  Long!
 ...miles. 
...uh, drifting around like the trash you are, or were you here workin'?
...-lem?
...seriously.
Mason, you wouldn't know the truth if it bit you.  We've got your whole record.  We know about the-the conviction for vagrancy...
...side!
What happened to Colonel Brynner?
What the hell was that?
  All right.
I'll lead 'em out.


I don't know how that got in the paper as a matter of fact  it surprised me it was so quick. I make an honest living.
An honest living.
Fine, as long as you don't serve chicken that way.
They're calling it an accident.
It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.
Maybe.
Sheriff's gold posse... bunch of damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece to the sheriff's reelection. I let 'em practice up out here.
I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.
I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves.
...the coroner's report showed Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.
No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am doing with the Valley. The bond issue passes Tuesday. There'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. I'm doing it.
Hello.
What are you talking about?
Thanks. You know something, Jake?
Oh they don't?
What kind of guy do you think I am?
Sure thing.
Off the alley.
Tell Mrs. Mulwray to wait for half an hour after you get there. Then if I don't show, take her down to the boat.
Thanks, Lou.
Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
Yeah?
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
I guess not.
Mrs. Mulwray, you don't want to run around like that.
What are you having?
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
Looks like you went quite a distance.
How did you find out?
Oh, no. I've got my own car. The creamcolored Packard.
Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?
Oh, yeah?
What are you thinking?
That dam is a con job.
What dam?
The Valley?
No, I think I'd remember.
Yeah.
Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.
The Albacore Club.
Do? To who?
I want you to listen to me. My father is a very dangerous man. You don't know how dangerous. You don't know how crazy.
It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.
C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there!
Aren't you coming back with me?
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
Where's the girl?
Upstairs. Why?
What did you do that for?
...no...
...he had a breakdown... the dam broke... my mother died... he became a little boy... I was fifteen... he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast, what clothes to wear!... It happened... then I ran away...
I'll take care of it.
With us.
On his day off. Get the exact address.
Sophie.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
What'd you expect? That's his job.
Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
I'm sorry. We don't.
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.
Mind if I take one of your cards? In case I want to get in touch with you again.
Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.  Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?
Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting. These staff meetings, they just go on and on.
I never was.
Well, look at it this way, Mr. Yelburton.  Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned.
Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
Gittes?... Gittes?
How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?
Mr. Gittes...
No, really?
Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your husband?
But...
I'm sure he loves you, too. You know the expression, let sleeping dogs lie? You're better off not knowing.
All right, what's your husband's first name?
Gittes.
Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud. I only heard one thing  apple core.
Yeah?
Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
You don't say?
Alfredo, did you know my father?
You understand which side the gelatin's on?
Stop it! I've had enough of your sermons! You act as if you created the world! 
Heeey! Totooooo! Don't get pissed off with me now! Come here! I don't know where the fuck I have to go.  And the next time be careful how you talk. Not to take credit away from the Lord, but if I had created the world, in all modesty, certain things would have come out better. But unfortunately such was not the case.
Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. And if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...
Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed.  When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that the case?...You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born...But not now, it's impossible. Now you're blinder than I am. 
My name's Salvatore...And yours?
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
No...
Hey, Brad!  Brad!  He ain't been drinking before, Mr. Kane. Never.  We would have heard.
Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low...  Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? In the opinion of this reviewer -
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case.
You're right, Mr. Bernstein.
So then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh?  Especially the new papers -
He's a great guy - Leland.  Why'd he ever leave New York?
Yes.  I thought it was a good idea. We've covered it from the news end, of course.
Oh, yes, it's already made up.  Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
Yes, very!  Naturally.
That Rosebud?  Maybe some girl?  There were a lot of them back in the early days, and -
Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me.  Just - 
I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr. Bernstein.  You people work too fast for me!  Talk about new brooms!
How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
I'm not criticizing, Mr. Carter, but here's what I mean.  There's a front page story in the "Chronicle,"  and a picture - of a woman in Brooklyn who is missing.  Probably murdered.  A Mrs. Harry Silverstone.  Why didn't the "Enquirer" have that this morning?
It isn't finished?
There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?
Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
Hello, Brad -
I don't see what else you can do, Charles.  If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has -
I can't tell you the things he said, Charlie.  You haven't got any idea -
Get out, both of you!
Where's the soap?
You're getting farther away all the time.  It's a duck.
You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and - 
Who am I?  Well, let's see.  Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six -  I run a couple of newspapers.  How about you?
Is that what you want to do?
You always said you wanted to live in a palace.
You're in a tent, darling.  You're not at home.  And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.
Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!
Susan, I really think -
Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you.  What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at?  It's only money.  It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.
You're talking an incredible amount of nonsense, Susan.  Whatever I do -  I do - because I love you.
I'm going to leave you.
Don't you realize that everybody here is going to know about this? That you've packed your bags and ordered the car and -
I won't let you go.
I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean.  You're a man of great talents, Mr. Kane.
I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher.  I just try everything I can think of.
You see!  There hasn't been a true word -
Is Mrs. Kane - 
Raymond - 
He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do you know what it means?
Good.
Yes?
Brad, you are drunk.
It does seem too good to be true, doesn't it, Mr. Bernstein?
Maybe you could remember something that -
On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?
There's a part of a Scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it.
Thompson!
Yes, sir.
But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -
Millions - if anybody wants it.
The banks are out of luck, eh?
Oh!  I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
How did you meet him?
What's this?
It's not the same.
Maybe you should take that coffee outside.
Yeah, but not in here.
What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!
I take it she likes the guy.
Children's programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore?
Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
You saw it?
Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?
No.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.
Sang? His name is a past tense?
Jesus, you're caustic.
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
I hear that's a rather popular date.
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away.
Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me.
This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.
I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule.  Is the Pelican flying?
Who was on your phone this morning at about two-thirty? I was trying to call for a half an hour.
I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
You win.
I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
Eight and a half.
That's cheating?
Caitlin's on the same wave-length?
Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.
And the second one was still being built when they blew it up.
Wait.
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
Did you ever notice all the prices end in nine? Damn, that's eerie.
You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.
Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
Can you believe this?!
Sorry.
No argument here. Insubordination rules.
Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
How? When?
What!?
I'm going with you.
You were saying?
Shut the hell up.
I could never reach.
I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
Let me borrow your car.
Please, get the hell out of here.
No way!
Little girl. Maybe five years old?
No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
Now I know you're lying.
Who eats cock?
This life?
Am I right or what?
Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
How do you know that?
Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
Done poisoning the youth for the day?
Pay the good man.  Don't you close soon?
I work, just like you. You're more of a crook than I am, dude.
Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?
All right. How much is Pepsi here?
So.
You used to go out with her?
Don't you already have a girlfriend?
I jacked the car up. All she did was loosen the nuts and put the tire on.
Meaning?
Actually, that's his night job.
Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep!
Why did you agree to come in then?
I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.
I was kidding.
Typically male point of view.
I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.
How many girls have you slept with?
How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
Twelve.
What the hell was that for?
No; who were the three, besides me?
Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
How many?
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.
I had to tell someone. He put it into perspective.
And he said most of them are college guys, I've never met or seen.
Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee?
You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
It was only a few times...
You said you were here all day?
I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! I swear!
Scumbag. What are you doing?
He's your cousin?
I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
No way!
You came for that too? That's the movie I came for.
Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today.  C'mon with us.
"It's a perfect day for a monster jump."  Hey man, can you like do me a favor?
C-4?
He said the Tower, but he's on Comb Bluff?  Frank, fly me to the west valley, the winds are never too bad there and it's only a half hour climb to the Douglas Shaft.
Surprise me.
Jessie!  Are you alright?
No, stay off the line!  You'll break her loose!
She's losing it!
Well you were wrong! It was your weight on the line that did it--
There wasn't time for anything else.
Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.
How're ya feeling?
Fine, I guess...
Please, can I think about this for a minute...Okay, I'm sorry, it's fine.  What do you want me to do?
Just keep lookin' at me and only think about the distance <u>across</u>. Count it as you go:  One, two...by eight you'll be there.
Can I count as fast as I like?
Use your other hand!  Grab it!
Hello, Gabriel.
Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.
Why are you yelling?
Did I miss something?
Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
Resuscitation?
From one professional to another, of course.
I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
Can't do it?  I don't believe this.  Don't you feel anything?
They've got to find shelter soon, and so do we.  How are you holding up?
Of course I do.
A simple yes or no would have done.
Pull it apart!
Reach up!  Do it!
But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.
Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
Forget it!  I refuse!
Never could save a thing.
He'll freeze.
He never hurt anybody.
Tucker, you know where the money is-- I want it.
Then where the fuck is!
Go after her.
I don't know about totally.
Travers!  Hurry it up.
Kill me?  Christ we're partners in this!
Why?  What are you going to do?!
What about it?
This way.
Is it set?
We've been working hard too. Takes glass.
Yes, sir, that's exactly who I am, sir... and what I am... a victim, sir. Mr. Alexander becomes frenzied as the speech progresses.
Thank you, sir.
My wife... Alex freezes.
How do you do, sir?
Very kind of you, sir. Thank you very much.
Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I'll try to sleep it off... then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.
Alex.
Cut out all this clever talk about milicents. Just because the Police haven't picked you up lately doesn't, as you very well know, mean that you've not been up to some nastiness. There was a bit of a nastiness last night, yes. Some very extreme nastiness, yes. A few of a certain Billyboy's friends were ambluenced off late last night, yes. Your name was mentioned, the word's got thru to me by the usual channels. Certain friends of yours were named also. Oh, nobody can prove anything about anybody as usual, but I'm warning you, little Alex, being a good friend to you as always, the one man in this sore and sick community who wants to save you from yourself. Deltoid makes a grab for Alex's joint but finds his hand instead. Alex laughs. Derisively and rises. Deltoid distractedly reaches for a glass of water on the night table, and fails to notice a set of false teeth soaking in them. He drinks from the glass. The clink of the teeth sounding like ice-cubes.
You are now a murderer, little Alex. A murderer, yes.
That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it.
Do you feel that way now?
Come, come, come, Georgie Boy. You're a big strong chelloveck like us all. We're not little children, are we, Georgie Boy? What, then, didst thou in thy mind have? Confrontation. Georgie backs down.
Helping you, sir?
One I think you will like... as a, how shall I put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. An understanding between two friends.
Hey, Dad, there's a strange fella sitting on the sofa there munchy- wunching lomticks of toast.
What about Basil? Where's my snake?
What gives, O my Pee and Em, what makes you think you are welcome? Em sobs. Pee comforts her.
... and this... He pulls Alex's nose.
Yes, sir.
Yes sir.
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
The chocolate and cigarettes you brought in - you lose that as you are now convicted. Now go over to the table and get undressed. Alex walks to table and undresses. Chief Guard moves to table with his clipboard.
C of E, sir.
Do you wear any false teeth or false limbs?
I haven't seen you before.
I'm your Psychiatrist.
Yes. Yes, well don't think about it too long, just say the first thing that pops into your mind.
That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
Eggiwegs. I would like to smash 'em. Pick up th elot and f... owww... He slams his hand down and cries out with pain.
Fine. Well, that's all there is to it. Are you alright?
I hope so. Is that the end then?
What's all this about sin?
And, Father, I've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, have I?
Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul.
Very good, Chief. They inspect cells.
Leave to carry on, sir, please?
Moloko-plus.
Shall we go to my office?
Sixth, you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at Herald Square. Look, I make this trip all the time.
No.  I got lucky with the lights.
No?  How many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money?
He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
A deer?
Right through those doors.  The man himself.
The crowd had to dig it.
I know the answer.  I know all there is to know about Louis.
Vincent.  Do not cross me.
...got off the phone with his dispatcher.  What an asshole. Cabbie's name is Max Rilke, been driving that cab for ten years...
Cabbie drove around all night.  Three people got killed.
Oh, right.  The guy flipped out or something?  Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?
They found him dead in his own cab down by the Port Authority.
...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue.  The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.
Joey Cicerno.  Dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, Ivan Petrov.  Both of whom were in bed with Dmitri.
I was with Max when he got the call.
Try?
What's he sayin'?
He's not paying you one cent!
Nothin'!  Aside from Max's mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin' on a rainbow!  Get him on the line, please.
...everything is not about me, don't make me the villain here.  That asshole was out of line, and you goddamn well know it...
Yeah.  I share it with the dayshift guy.
I don't talk about it, you know...  No offense.
I think he's dead.
You cool, Max?  Say "I'm cool."
You were going to drive me around. Drop me at LAX.  Never be the wiser. But El Gordo missed the elevator.  So we go to Plan B.  Pop the trunk.
Are you breathing?
I Ching?  You threw a man out a window!
Who was he?
Please.  Don't do anything.
I'll talk to them, I'll talk to them.
It was an accident.  You're not liable.  Tell him.
Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
I had no idea these cabs came equipped with emergency strobes.  Where's the button?  Under the dash?
What?
Collateral damage.
I never learned jazz.
Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...
I'm not catching a melody.
Let him go, Vincent.
What you mean, no?
Guy with a routine goes and breaks it? Provokes attention.  That's bad.  And that's not good...
What the fuck was <u>that?</u>
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
It's not bullshit.
Yeah?  Like what?  Limos?
Gimme your wallet.
Dmitri?
That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
It's what I do for a living.
Are you crazy?!
You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
I can't promise you anything.
You think I'm crazy.
What was your horse's name?
What took so long?  You were in there all day.
Oswald was an assassin.  You're not an assassin, are you, Jerry?
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
Nothing scary there.  Sorry.
That's it?
So why are they after you?
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
Never heard of him.
Who are you, Jerry?
It was that painting.  The one on the wall.
Where'd you get your subscribers?
Well, I've been tracking them down all morning.
Realized what?
Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
Murdered?
You're wrong.  Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore.
Now's not really the time to get into this --
Where are we going, Jerry?
Liza?
At a horse show.
Can't give you the details because I can't remember.  I went to court to kill him.  At the Ezekiel Walters hearing.  I was supposed to shoot him at the press conference.  You were there. That's the first time I saw you.
Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.
Without a song in my heart.
You're welcome.  Where's my partner?
I'm not sure what you mean.
That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
We got someone watching her 24 hours a day.  She --
Then screw you.  I'll rot.
That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.
We're very specialized.
It was mind control.  <u>Manchurian</u> <u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right?
Terminal?
I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
I don't like it.  Something's wrong.
While we walk.  D.C. police want him for assault. Secret Service for counterfeiting and we're tracking him on a string of bank robberies.  No one knows what the C.I.A. wants him for.
Guy's a C.I.A. shrink.  Here to I.D. Fletcher.  They knew each other somehow.
Which way did he go?
Where do you think Jerry is?
Dr. Arroway --
I'm not.  You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
Peter sends his regards.
'President's Science Advisor' -- so what, you just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now...?
Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
I want you to listen to me, carefully.  The minute the implications of this message became clear, this stopped being simply a scientific matter and became a political one -- an extremely complex, extremely volatile one. There are forces at work here you don't understand; I can help you up to a point, but only up to a point.
What is it?  What's happened?
You mean --
Actually I'm running late --
You...
J39 Z186...?
I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.
Is that your official response?
There is no direct evidence, no.
I can't move any smaller.
Could we hear to China?
Mmm, that's a good one.  Maybe his echo...  Okay, no more stalling.
... life is unspeakably rare.  So whenever we do find another civilization, especially one that's... struggling... We send a message.  Sometimes we can offer help.  Sometimes we can't.  But we always try.  Life is simply too precious not to.
Eventually you'll get here on your own.  This was just the first step; in time you'll take another.
That isn't the way it works.
I didn't realize I was out.
Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
What are you talking about?  It's over.
They can't.  I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
... We've been going after some of the big multi-nationals but without much luck; got a donation from a New York dowager... We've even been thinking about selling T-shirts.
How close are you to getting this funding put together?
The V.L.A.?
Thirty-one linked dishes.  You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.
Right now -- we'll drive down to Ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us.
Ellie -- are you okay?
And you believe this law with all your heart and soul.
I flinched.
... It's an old story.  I grew up in South Boston, more or less on the streets.  By the time I was thirteen I'd tried my first hit of heroin, by fifteen I'd stopped using but I was dealing full-time.  By the time I was nineteen I decided I didn't want to live any more, at least not in a world like that.  One day I got on a bus; I got as far as Ohio before my money ran out, and after that I just kept walking.  Didn't eat, didn't sleep... just walked.  I ended up collapsing in a wheat field.  There was a storm... I woke up...  And that's about as far as words'll go.
And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
Did you love him?
I don't think so.
Why?
Really.
I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie.  I'm not 'out to get' technology.  I only ask the question:  Does it have to have all the answers?  I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.
Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
Ellie --
Ellie... the last time we spoke... I said some things...
I'm sorry.
Ellie, you're the proof.  You tell them your story.  Ultimately they'll have no choice but to believe you.
Dr. Arroway, you are entitled to your opinion.  But we feel quite strongly that it would by both irresponsible and naive to send a human being into a completely unknown, completely uncontrollable situation absolutely defenseless.
How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?
Well.  That would seem to decide it. Like it or not, for the moment, anyway, it looks like we're all in this together.
No it hain't, Luke. You ain't alone. Ever whar you go, I'm with you, and so's John.
No.
That's good: he earned it.
She's on to him. You shoulda waited fer me to git her out -- loose like she is, he kin run her crazy.
You was to sell your job, maybe this Lucas War Hero would give you a price.
Oh, man, did you see her? Did you see her?
Jus' take it slow, buddy.
A cold drink? You mean one cold drink? To feast yore starvin' fishy l'il eyes on The Picture? A true vision of Paradise itself? With two of the angels right there in plain sight a- friskin' round with mah boy?
Well, whatta we got here?
Plumb busted out. Looks like the hard road finally got to Mister Lucas War Hero.
You ol' sack of guts. I had a belly like yours, we wouldn't have nothin' to worry about.
Don't hit me no more, Boss! Don't hit me! I'll do anythin' you say but just don't hit me! Oh Luke. You are an original, you truly are. You really fooled them.
On my own.
You just said he could eat anything.
A bunch. Must be halfa dozen Newmeat.
I gotta believe. Out!  Now they're rollin'.  King-five-four gets an eight.  Pair'a nines with a Jack gets a four. Ninas still up.
Koko, why don't you let one of these Newmeats take your broom for today?
You think you've been working hard. This muther'll break your back.
What are you talking about?
I don't see no sign of guts in you.
No. No chains either.
You've been having bad luck with masters, haven't you? Your last one left you when the cops came... and now Luke. You should complain to the S.P.C.A.
You threatened to drive her downtown.  She has agoraphobia.
When was the last time you washed your hair?
Oh, God.  I must have looked horrible.
No, dear.  You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.
I want to die.
None of you know anything about it. Now go.  And Andy, if you persist in playing doctor, leave, with them.
He took pains to hide his actions because he knew they were morally wrong.  He was not acting on mad impulse.  He was sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time.
What pattern was that?
You already made the delivery?
Hello, Daryll Lee.
Where are you, Peter?
For God's sake Peter, leave her out of it.  You don't want her, you want me.
Who is this?
Is it an ongoing case?
How do you know that?
The bodies have been carefully arranged... different positions, but somehow the same.  The positions are brutal... yet quite... artful.  It's like... a signature.  He's proud of his accomplishments.  There are early Picassos and late Picassos, but you always recognize the hand.  He wants us to recognize <u>his</u> hand. I've seen this hand before... what are you hiding?
How do you know that?
It's <u>anybody</u> connected to author- ity.  They write, they even knock on your door.  They're <u>fans</u>.  It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.
That's amazing.  A whole new book, thought up in a minute.  Very good.  All I know how t do is get up, take a shower, and go to work. Hope, if he does another I'll nail the son of bitch, and they'll spell my name right in the newspaper. Where is Andy going?
That's no surprise.
He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.  Where's the on-switch?
Helen -- the killer directly contacted you.  His interest in you is <u>intense</u>.  I'm worried about you. I don't want to lose you.  I know this stirs up every monster under the bed, but this is the only direct contact we have with him. The only chance we have to trap him.  So, you can turn Internet back on, or I do, and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick, scream and hyperventilate.
Hello, Ruben...  So that's that...
Is that it?
Let's speed up the game plan... call all the living serials to ask if they've had contact with a Peter Kurten.  We could use some help on the phones...
What happened to you?!
A man?  I thought he was a boy.  This last Christmas was the happiest Christmas I had in the last ten years... you know why?  It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love.  Son of a bitch <u>married men</u>!  Who cares about marriage, the bed just gets crowded and noisy?!
He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape.
I know 'Halloran.'  What's the rest of it?
Yes.  I have to go...
Open the door.  Please.
I was.
Well, you outranked <u>me</u>, Nikko.
Don't put yourself down like that. I <u>never</u> used you.  I worked my way up like a marine grunt!
Yeah, you did that too.  You earned what you got; don't shit on it, that's all I'm saying.
You're in terrible trouble, Nikko.
Just horseshit luck.
You got a tape backup, yeah, here lemme copy it on tape...
She's blue as hell.  No marks on her neck.  Asphyxiated?  not the same -- no ligature marks.  Outdoors...
Now listen up, Ruben.  You never, never, never mess with somebody <u>inside</u> the case!
You damn well better start working on that impulse control.  A woman who is implicated in this case? Someone who's practically a piece of <u>evidence</u>?
I tagged the goddamned stocking. It ain't lost.  We're sequestering that evidence.  That's the trap some son of a bitch is going to fall into...
If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic.
I didn't want the Illigals, I wanted just the bastards dumping them in the harbor.  What's keeping those bums at Immigration?  Nightmare in here...
Saks.  If he knew you did that! They're all asking me, 'what is she doing,' as it is.
She's in no shape to give her statement tonight...
She knows I'm Catholic!  She never mentioned divorce!  Not once!
Minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel. The instrument panel was buckled inwards, cracking the clock and the speedometer dials. The cabin was deformed, and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside. The carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids.
You should have gone to the funeral.
I wish I had. They bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months.
What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet?
Renata tells me you're going to rent a car.
Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy.
Are we allowed to park here?
What exactly is your project, Vaughan? ~ book of crashes? A medical study? A sensational documentary? Global traffic?
I'm afraid Lhe's not a doctor.
But what I really can't believe is that I'm starting to actually miss work.
I thought about calling, but I want to wait until I know when I'll be out.
How?
Yeah, everything's under control.
You look beautiful.
Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
Maybe I should talk about this with Ruth, or Paul.
And my class. It'll be hard to find a good substitute. And what about my math program?
Tomorrow?
We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.
I hear this Michael fellow is schizophrenic.
I'm only looking out for you.
Must you walk so quickly?
I don't know why you feel you have to lie, Letty.
If you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so.
No.
I had to sneak by the guards to get here. They say you're highly unstable, have a depressive personality, and may hold back my own recovery.
Wow.    I'm bad news.
What's my rap?
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
No way.
I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
You're right. I guess I was projecting. What I should have said is, "It's a good thing I love you."
I love your apartment.
What do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate?
Hey.
Who ever said sanity was fun?
The restaurant, too?
Aunt Lily?
Why'd you tell?
Michael, take it easy.
I guess we need to talk.
But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean to do that.
I'm sorry.     I didn't come here to blame you.
What do you want to do?
What are you doing?
I talked to Ruth a little bit, and I think it's about time...
So will you?
What's so urgent?   You've got me worried.
I've met someone else.
Who?
How's work going?    Are you back at school?
Our relationship meant a lot to me, too, Paul. But it's over.  And Michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things.
Office work?
How's it look?
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
You're there now?
You're calling me on is phone?
You've already robbed the safe?
Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big--
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
Okay.   How much?
Uh, no --
Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about your brother?
I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
Why didn't you tell me about this?
Yes.
This plane will take you to Canada. From there you can fly back to Paris.
Turn on the flashlight.
I can't believe you didn't check.
Besides, we don't know the city and--
You're sure?
Do I?
I'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you're testing mine.
It's not?
It makes sense. I mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?
Hadley --
Hello?
Can I trust you, Sami?
Guns.   Can you get them?
A thousand dollars?
What?
You know why I'm handling it very well? Because you're going to get these guys for me.
No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
No, I didn't.
We've got to get out of here.
God, I want to go home.
Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
No.   It's mine.
How?
I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.
I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
I can't even hear myself think.
Who's gonna see it there?
Why?
Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
You're back!
Stop talking like a monk!  Just fight!
You don't seem to understand.
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?
Please sit.
Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.  God knows what the future will bring.
My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
About you and Li Mu Bai?
His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.  Our feelings for each other grew stronger.  But how could we dishonor Meng's memory?  So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.  But I have never tasted it.
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
Don't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's sword.
What I've always wanted, to teach you.
I will.
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
I don't understand.  How can you part with it?  It has always been with you.
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's. On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's.  Were you involved?
I don't know it was stolen until I got here.
I admit, getting it back makes me realize how much I'd missed it.
But it's not your sword anymore. You gave it to Sir Te.
True.  But I must borrow it for one last mission.  Jade Fox must die at its edge.  Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone.  I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.
Don't you want to see her again.
Not everything is an illusion.  My hand... wasn't that real?
It's Jade Fox!
You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me.  Please accept our thanks.
But the sword could be in his compound.
Care for a hot dog?
And I say I'm dead... and I move.
You okay, man?  I mean, what just happened.
You're welcome.
I was wonderin' where you'd gotten to --  Oh, Elly, honey, a cat.  Here?
At least it finally stopped raining.
You look like a rock star without a job.
Does she have a name?
Do you feel okay.
I remember him!  Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?
I don't know if I can.  But you have this... and you know where to come.
Holy shit... you're dead, man...
Who gives a fuck!  I'm a businessman.  You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face!
And how many lives have you destroyed?
Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  Look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit!  AAAAaa!  Goddd!
Having fun yet?  No?  I'll give you a hint.  Remember whatshername?
Go away.
Don't waste my time.
Coupla more rings... 24k.
Mmm.  But tonight I can take what is his.
I don't think so.
Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
He told you he's failing in love with you? I've never known him to say those words before.
Nothing.
Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
What do you mean?
You did?
Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.
The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away.
No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
Why not?
That's repulsive.
Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind.
Alright.  I want you to leave and go back to New York.
What?
What are you reading?
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
Because I'm in love with you.
I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!
You really want to know?
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
- none taken -
Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
The football stud?
Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up.
I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter.
Oh, I suck. I suck.
It's based on the life of Doctor Martin Luther King.
He's alright.  He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
That's great.
Okay.
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
Cecile, you had an orgasm.
I did?
Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you.
It's like a secret society.
I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
Just taking your photo.
Just a kiss, right?
But -
You think?
Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
You do?
Nudie pictures, what do you think?
-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah.
Yes.
Where is she?!
And when I confronted him about his affair with Cecile he told me it was none of my business. Then when I said "Well what about Ronald," he said you were nothing more than a stupid... the n word and that you deserved what you got...
Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house?
Why go through Cecile? Why not just attack Court?
Care to make a wager on that?
In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.
What's your plan of attack?
Shut up.
So what went wrong?
You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.
Where'd she go?
Bad time?
It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
Excuse me?
And that's why you're leaving?
A little melodramatic, don't you think.
Come again?
I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
I think you have your answer.
Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell.
I've already told you, she's not home.
Do you know when she'll be back?
Yes, you already did.
What are you talking about?
Did you hit her?
Yes, darling.
Are they nice?
Well  the mother or daughter -- whichever one gave it to you. You ask Edward to go with you.
But it's already come true.
It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?
Well, it shows imagination, anyhow.
What do you mean?
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.
But wishes don't come true.
I wanted to talk to you,  I wanted to tell you about the other children.
They ran away.
And this one's for Mrs. Farren.
She gave me a ring, so I'm giving her a ring. I paid twenty-five cents for it, too.
Yes, Amy?
But there's no one here, darling.
I don't know yet.
I can not tell you.
For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
Yes, yes! I see Prince,
That's right!
light shining) in her eyes) Throw sea weeds into the flames, and the fire turns blue!
But we don't have any sea weed.
May I pet the deer?
Don't cry, Amy.
Yes, Amy.
Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.
You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
But it was alive  it was fast and strong!
But my mother says I mustn't accept gifts from strangers.
He'll let me stay, Mrs. Farren. He'll let me stay.
Hide me? Why?
The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died.
Promise me you won't forget tomorrow. You'll remember, won't you? You won't say that it was just a dream. Promise me.
What is it, ma'am?
Well, ma'am, the truth is, I gave them to Amy hersolf to post.
But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
What?
I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
We're worried about you. "60 Minutes" was on same-sex couples.
No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
Translation: a total geek.
Only to see.
Maybe he likes you, ever think of that? It's good for you to go out -- get your mind off Mark.
You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.
Maybe they have to pee.
Where?
No, did you fuck him?
I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
I couldn't stop eating steak. I felt out of control -- like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I couldn't get enough. And then Gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
What? Why the hell did he do that?
And then?
Okay. I guess so.
I think he called you beautiful.
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!
Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?
Tuesday. Are you okay?
And he was missing an arm.
Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
He's been here all night?
What happened to his tooth?
So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
What choice do we have?
I guess you'll find out.
I think George knows.
Hello?
Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is really over.
You hungry?
No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
I didn't have to pee then.
I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.
You look different. I mean you look good.
OUCH that stings! Damn, what am I going to do with my back like this?
It's a matter of life and death.
These guys aren't the kind that'll take an apology. They're the kind that'll break my thumbs.
Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.
Mark.
Did you change your hair?
Yes, that's what we're looking for.
Uh... yes. Not for us. No woman in jeopardy. Find me Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. Find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women.
I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.
It's stupid.
Used to? Did it stop finally?
Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
I mean we can still... whatever... Maybe I should get a towel?
Everything okay?
I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
You know, I've never seen your cat.
Hello?
NO! Don't come over. Peter... I... I don't want to see you anymore. Ever.
Go away. I might hurt you.
I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead.
We can get a warrant if you like.
Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
You're some catch Lloyd.
Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?
What?
What makes her think that?
Thanks.  Just some pills.
Sell maps?
Not really...
Says he is the man's doctor...  You know...
Police.  Nobody move.
Really?  And how is his state of mind?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Germs, sir.  These places are full of them.
It seems fine.
Where are we going?
Can't let you in...  sorry.
I didn't realise...
Then we must call the police.
Known me for long?
I'm sorry.  About before.
What is it?
I can't do that.  It's dangerous. What about my parents?  Do you know where I can find them?
First Lady...
They barely talk anymore.
Okay, let's go over it again. You met a girl, you fell in love...
A month.
Right and don't embellish.
What do you think you're doing?!
Oh... I'm fired?
I can't believe he'd do this.
Don't call the Vice President!
Just don't call him, Alan!
Up and around?  Soon?
He's not a President! He's an ordinary person.  I can kill an ordinary person.
Bob...
I'm not sure.
What do you mean you made it all up?
Alan...
`Dave'?
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
Mr. President, may I speak frankly with you?
Something like what...
... Sometimes they do.
What?
You ever use it?
No.
What's that?
You sure you don't want a lift back home?
... How could I what?
Yes.
You really believe that?
I missed...
So this is it?
... Not exactly the Oval Office.
There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...
What do we do? Let'em know we're here....or what?
I'm sorry, General, if I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I don't believe due process is being served by...
Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.
They seem to be havin' a good time. Some punishment.
Datura.
Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's a flower that grows on these islands. Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it...or...in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system.
Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel!
We always planned to use it. We got some ground up already...but we could never find enough.
I'm gonna have this stuff sent over to the hospital...
What'dya tell that soldier, soldier? You tell him we was rebels?
We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will...
One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.
You gave them a fresh taste of blood!
If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial.
Step up here, Tyler.
No, sir.
What'dya get?
Say Steve, where's your manners?  Here's Mutt's brother and you don't offer him a drink? Want some bourbon?
Do they go to Henley Hall?
I don't think they're in school.
Charlie Dalton.
Women swoon!
I feel like I've never been alive.  For years I've been risking nothing.  I have no idea what I am or what I want to do! Neil, you know you want to act.  Knox wants Chris.
At Chet Danburry's house.
So you really think she means you're going with her?
Well, welcome to "Hell"ton.
It's every bit as hard as they say. Unless you're a genius like Meeks.
Oh come on, Cameron, don't you get anything?
Yaa, I'm a dead poet!
Ahh!  Eat it, Dalton!
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
Sucking out the marrow doesn't mean getting the bone stuck in your throat, Charles.  You still have responsibilities to yourself and those who care about you.
Anything else you'd care to rifle through, Mr. Dalton?
I think he's sweet.
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.  You're not like that.
Hey, he's your roommate.
Sure.
I went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately."  I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life!"
What happened?
Don't stop.
So, uh, where are you in school?
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
Well, sure!
carpe breastum.  Seize the breast.
Of course just like that.  That's how you always know when it's right.
Are you going with Chet?
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
Knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it-
Your reprimand made quite an impression I'm sure.
A yawp?
Again!  Louder!
Todd, there's a picture of Whitman over the door.  What does he remind you Of? Quickly, Anderson, don't think about it.
Don't stop!
All right!  What'd she say?
All right.  Jesus, what are you gonna do?
Any group pictures in the annual?
But father, I'm assistant editor.
When you've finished medical school and you're on your own, you can do as you please.  Until then, you will listen to me.
My brother went here.
Well, you've won the booby prize.  Don't expect to like it here.
I've found it.
They're putting it on at Henley Hall. See, open try-outs.
But if he said no before then...
No?  What do you mean 'no'?
Neil, how are you gonna do this?
Here, villain, draw and ready. where art thou?
They are...they are everywhere.
Which question is that?
Hanover, listen...
Unless you collected on the insurance...
So this boat of yours...that's what you do? Give people...rides.
That's what I do.
Hey! I didn't have to come back.
What?
Shut up! You hear me!!
Sure I do...I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of dentination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed.
That's it? That's all you give a shit about?
Me??
Joey...it's okay...
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
You know what I think? I think our luck has just about run shit out...
Was it the water in my eyes or were you guys about to...
Because it's cool, you know, I can always take a walk or something down the beach...
Why don't you back off?
Maybe plans changed...
What is it man?
Fuel up. Need fuel.
Those are mine!
Maxie! Hey Maxie wha'd'ya say!
Who's going?
They did not!
In case!!! The gun's in case!!!
Albert! For Christ's sake... John! Wait a minute, you guys!
Couple of weeks... Listen --
Well, where the hell is he!!! I mean what are we all sitting here for!!!  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???
Did you ever think life would turn out like this?
But I insist.
Yeah.
I love Linda, see. I love Linda more than I can even say.
Everybody love Linda.
How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda?
Linda, yeah.
She's in back.
Yeah?
Hey, guys...
Fine. Hey, I'm fine.
No. How's Angela? How's she taking it?
Talked to Sal?  Sal's alive?
Why?... What do you mean?... Why???
Here.
Biederman, yes.
Listen, Biederman, I'm going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so important.
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --
What are you doing?
Yeah... All the guys, we're all going huntin'. Like we did. You know? Like we always used to.
Linda... Honey, what's wrong?
Playing.
No. No, no.
Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand?
You think about it?
Pow?
Merle --
It's ahead, by the tree.
I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come.
I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
Nick!... I thought you went home.
What's that noise?
Place is great. Really. One great place... Basketball, bowling. You name it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of guys are making salad bowls. What I'll do is make a salad bowl for you, unless you'd rather have a pencil holder. The pencil holder's neat, I mean --
I saw him last night. I thought I was dreaming. I thought I was out of my mind.
No.
What'cha got, Bennett?
Kimberly!
You son-of-a-bitch.  How do you stop it?
Remember my promise.
Just got the call.  Took him from school.  Bastard nailed the Vice- Principal and a teacher.
I don't want to hear anymore.
Sir, your dinner with the union leaders begins in an hour.  Your wife will meet you there, so we can leave whenever you're ready.
Sir---
You my partner?
Whoa.  Don't touch that.  <u>Pursuit</u> <u>Mode</u>.  Auto pilot.  Computerized steering and driving system used in high speed pursuits.  Installed Fall 2006.  Underground rumor has it they modeled it after you, sir.
They're going to rob that bank.
You can't turn him off.  He's the Commissioner.
Hey, buddy...
Sir, I took the liberty of running a GCI scenario on a TM-1 earlier today...
Why?
Yeah.
I'll be okay.
Hey, I'm eating.
Maybe I should turn myself in.
How ya feeling?
...Have you been drinking?
Yeah.
Belle Dee. I'm from over the mountain.
Jabez -- ?
You're not resting well, are you? I know -- it's that music.  You need your sleep. Is there anything else you want?
Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
Daniel! Don't ever let me catch you doing that again!
I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around.
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
You're not -- Dorothy.
No. She's gone.
She couldn't be gone!
Belle.
-- in gold.
I do -- and I think you should too.
You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did.  I guess I did.
Of course. Why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county.  You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do. Hard work -- well, that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else. It's all right for people who aren't lucky -- but once you're lucky -- you don't work for other people. You make them work for you.
Are they all as -- small -- as that?
Well now, Mr. Stone, did you make up your mind?
Mr. Webster -- I'd like you to meet my wife, Mary.
They make plucky women in New England.  H'm ... how long have we to wait?
Howdy, Squire! Howdy! Oh -- how do you do, Squire.
Yes  siree -- that's the idea. Get them all here and then say: "Look, folks -- here's Daniel Webster, my guest of honor." Golly, I can see their eyes pop already.
Well -- yes --
5000 -- that's just what I owe you.
Jabez -- help!
What is that smile on your face?  Is there anything wrong with me?
Do you think I'm grudging it?
Jabez! Couldn't you take a sack of seed instead?
To save us work on the spring plowing?
Jabez ...
Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same.
It feels fine now, Jabez.
Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
What do you think of that, Jabez?
We must go on home, Jabez.
There is nothing to worry about now.
Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word!
Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!
Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell.  Don't seem right, somehow!
You see, son? I'm old and I've lived. When a man gets his money in bad ways -- when he sees the better course and takes the worse -- then the devil is in his heart -- and that fixes him.
It don't matter!
I say -- it don't matter.
You throw mighty far, Jabez -- almost into the pigsty.
The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
It is.
Well -- she hardly ever comes here -- she's not the type of woman who cares to live in the country. Yes -- I'm all on my own -- sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely --  Do you mind if I indulge?
Hey there, Dan'l! Black Dan'l!
Just someone from New Hampshire!
I'd rather see you on the side of the opposition.
Say, that's pretty good, young man.
Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name?
Foreign? And who calls me a foreigner?
Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.
Very well. -- You shall have your trial, Mr. Webster. The case is hardly one for an ordinary jury --
Let it be the quick or the dead -- So it is an American judge and an American jury!
No, no ...  I want to talk to men ... to people in Cross Corners ...to my neighbors ...
If your friend is hot to trot...I know a couple of mama bears.  ...Or is he married?
The girl was off today.  Hey, I didn't expect you to sit up front.  So, your lady live out here?
You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?
So, why didn't you come?
Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...
You want...money?  What kind of terrorists are you?
The code key, please...?
Better than being caught with your pants down, right?  John McClane.
Nein, dies ein ist mein.  This time John Wayne does not walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.
...the circuits that cannot be cut... are cut automatically in reponse to a terrorist incident...You ask for miracles, Theo...I give you the FBI...
I...have a request.
It's a long story.  You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you.
No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?
Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours?  That doesn't even make any sense --
Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something for me.  Look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her, I should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.  She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry.  You get all that?
Roy?
Bullshit.
What's going on?
What about the body that fell out of the window -- ?
Don't let 'em off the ground.
If you're right I'm gonna back you a hundred percent, you know that.
These seats come out?
Jesus, you're the man!
Yes, I would.
What guns?
The robbers in the bank.  They got guns?
Oh... huh ... how you feeling?
I'm really shakey.
You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  And they start putting things in your arm... you know.  How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?
I don't know what I'm doing.
That's it.
Who the fuck knows?  I think we're gonna go ... we worked it out to Algeria.  So, I don't know.  So I'll go to Algeria.
I can't survive in prison, Sonny...
I don't know what to say to ya!  I guess I just wanted to say I'll see ya... or whatever.
Well, you got to get hold of yourself.  You got to talk to him, tell him to give himself up.
You're in it up to your ass, Leon. You're an accessory.  You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case.
Call me Sonny-boy.
I frisk you?
They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot?  Talk to me then.
You're all one way!  I'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin' ... Give me one of them, anyway ... Just one ...
When I'm bein' fucked, I like to be kissed a lot.  Who the fuck are you tryin' to con me into some deal?  You're a city cop, where's the FBI?  This is a federal offense, I got kidnapping, armed robbery, they're gonna bury me!  You know it, you can't talk for them, you're some flunky pig tryin' to bullshit me.  Now God damn it, get somebody in charge here to talk to me!
The girl hostages.
They were ...
You tryin' to fuck me?
Can't land ... you'd kill people ...
Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
He hasn't so far.  I'm the one who can make a mistake.  That's what scares the shit out of me.
You got kids?
Special to me, too.
Sure - we like you.
You know ... I like you people ... I really do.
Yeah.
Mister Mulvaney?
Little smoke: like a Polish four- alarm fire, is all.
It was on the TV.
You don't smoke ... why do you want to start now.
Because I don't want cancer.
You gonna smoke the cigarette?
Well, I stalled him for a while. When it comes the time, then we'll work it out.  Okay?
... because if you're talking about coppin' a plea, I'm tellin' you right now, there's no deal ... I'm never going back to prison ... We got our own deal already ... Do you remember the pact we made?  You and me and Jackie - that night in the bar ... we were talkin' about if we get trapped in the bank, what are you gonna do ... Right?  What did we say?  What did we say!
You realize, Sal, that we're gonna get outta the country, so if you wanna talk to somebody, do it now ... You gotta Mother or a Father? Friends?  If we gotta be outside the country, where do you wanna go?  Any country. Just name a country.
He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV.
No more favors.  That's all over, Sonny.
Aw, Jesus ... you been doin' us favors all night!
I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I have to.
I forgot she's in here.
My kids ... Kimmy and Jimmy.
I said you were never a faggot.
Don't talk to them anymore.  Sal and me are getting a jet, we're going to Algeria - I'll write you from there.
No!
Doing what?
Get a job doing what?  You gotta be a member of a union, no union card - no job.  To join the union, you gotta get the job, but you don't get the job without the card.
Oh yeah?  Give up?  You ever been in prison?
Morning.
Alright. Time to ditch this thing. Did you take a look at the bathroom window?
<i>He killed two children.</i>
Promise me... you won't ever tell Domino.
<i>Remove... ... the... right arm.</i>
You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.
Are you aware that Lateesha Rodriguez has been running a counterfeit driver's license racket?
<i>Now the bitch was getting personal.</i>
Take us to Vegas. <b> EXT. DESERT ROAD -- DAY </b> The crew rides in the back of the Wanderer's truck toward Vegas. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT </b> Domino stares at Taryn as she returns to the table.
No. Please enlighten me.
So Ed. What did you do before you became a bounty hunter?
Can you tell?
Son, with the exception of Spring Break in Tijuana, have you ever ventured outside of California?
And he used to fuck a Playboy centerfold every night.
Okay.  Domino Harvey is here.
Fast and or furious.
I'm trying to organize a boycott of Sal's pizza joint.  Ya see what I'm saying?
I almost had to yoke him this afternoon.  Tell me, tell me, Radio Raheem, to turn my music down. Didn't even say please.  Who the fuck he think he is?  Don Corleone and shit.
Talk to me.
Yo!
You almost knocked me down.  The word is "excuse me."
You come in here at least three times a day.  You a retard?  A buck fifty.
Ask Sal.
How old are you?
What makes Sammy run?
Good!  Leave me alone when I'm sleeping.  I'm gonna get a lock on my door, to keep ya ass outta here.
Don't ya love ya brother Mookie anymore?  I loves ya, Jade.
How come you're not at Sal's?
Yo, I'm gone.
Stop tripping.
Jade, you're late.
That's why I don't fool with it. Only let you touch it...Ouch!
You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it isn't right.
It's a fucking shame.
That's my name.
Can you pay me now?
Sal, just this once, do me that solid.
I work too, but I still make time.
It's 'pose to be cold.
You don't care about me and you definately don't care 'bout your son.
Tina, I'll be right back.
Mookie, late again.  How many times I gotta tell you?
Shaddup, Vito.
Magic Johnson.
And not Larry Bird?  Who's your favorite movie star?
Shut up.  The Boss!  Bruuucce!!!!
Pino, I work hard like everybody in here.
Brother, Mookie, if I love you I love you, but if I hate you...
Some are OK.
You listening to me?
You really think so?
Pino, relax, will ya.
We don't know nuthin' else.
Pop asked you.
But I came here to learn about America.
She's saying... a beautiful swan...
Depends how you define 'new'...
Yeah. How'd you know?
I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special
Ooh gross.
Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.
I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.
Why didn't you tell us your boyfriend was Principal Collins?
The name's Walter.
Is it true what you said to Captain Rob?
Is that what I think it is?
No no no no no.
Why not?
God, she's beautiful. My wiener's all tingly.
The second R is silent.
One day they'll find a cure.
Yeah, he's a pirate.
Peg leg?
I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say.
You look familiar. Did I have your brother?
No.
I didn't know that.
You're it.
Oh yeah, buddy, you're gonna get "some".
Now what are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
JESSICA and I are through. I couldn't stand being with her knowing you liked her. It wasn't worth our friendship. Oh, and she also has a boyfriend.
By the way, did Captain Rob mention how I beat the crap out of him this afternoon?
It's okay. I want the rush.
Cute puppy.
Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.
How true. But I still feel I deserve more than you do of this treasure. I mean, I found it.
I... found that rock.
That makes total sense. The treasure chest was in his office. Which means Principal Collins is a pirate! I'm surprised Captain Rob never mentioned him.
He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.
Sorry, Charlie.
MS. HELLER, mind if I tag along on your field trip? I'm thinking of doing a story on your special needs class.
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
THAT'S NOT YOUR TAPE.
What are you doing here?
Well, something stinks.
Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited! So, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? He whips out the key, she takes it.
I'm so close I can feel it.
No, it was a complete waste of time.
That's my boyfriend.
Duh. I'm in your class at school.
Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
Have you got what I want?
How was that?
What are you crazy kids doing in my tool shed?
So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine.
I am strong!
I can turn on all the faucets in my house.  Even the hose.
How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
To take a picture for Superintendent Zimmer?
Who's there?
Well I've got a little surprise for you.
Oh, things. Photos. Tapes. I tape everything that goes on in this office.
The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.
It was Jessica. That girl who tried to follow me on the field trip.
It was Feyd?  It was Feyd!  Where is the ducal signet ring?  I must have his ring.
What happens now?
I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
Yes?
We have just folded space from Ix...
So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...
So, this is Leto the Just...
I'm sorry Gurney.
You know the ancient tongues?
Say it not lightly...  Do you know its meaning?
The spice!  It's in everything here.  The air, the soil, the food...  It's like the Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me.  But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness.  I can see it... I can see it.
Man-carved steps.
Why do they come?
The Water of Life.
Long live the fighters!
I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals.
Not all of them... I know which ones will.
Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?
Now remember... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence.
Uh, beg to differ.
Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??
I don't want anything.  I'm just a really big, big fan.  I've seen all your movies.
Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
Eddie, you got a new movie for me?!
I don't understand.
You're right, Bela.  Now Dracula, <u>that's</u> a part that takes acting.
Bela, what happened?!
I never said I could ad-lib...
"Dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty.  A lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit!"  Damn!  Eddie, I'm sorry I can't remember all this.  I'm an old man. It's too long.
Huh?
Don't let me slow you down.
That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
Well, there aren't too many other fellas I'd do it for...
Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
Don't you have any savings?
No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.
Mexico!  And guess what I'm going to do there?!
You mean a Tesla coil?
Which one <u>is</u> the red one?
What happened?!  Jesus, Connie, what did you do?
Bravo!  Bravo!  Magnifico!
Well... there's a lot of junk in his system for such an old man. Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone.
Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.
How long have you been doing this?
And what about this so-called "Barbara" character?  It's obviously ME!  I'm so embarrassed!  This is <u>our</u> <u>life</u>!
That's the problem!  <u>Nobody</u> cares about my movie!  I'm tryin' so hard, I don't know what else to do!
I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
Look, how many times can I say I'm sorry?  I blew it!  I thought she was rich.
None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
I understand you just moved here?
So my associate Mr. Marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture.
Sorry to bother you while we're shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money.
It's Wood.  Ed Wood.
I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics.  It opens next week.
But Bela Lugosi's in it!
Yeah...?
<u>I'm</u> interested in the picture business.  My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money.
Okay -- you know what you do?  You produce a film in a commercially proven genre.  And after it's a hit, you take the profits from <u>that</u>, and make the twelve Apostles' movies.
Graverobbers from <u>what</u>??
Tor!
Here's the scene.  Loretta, you're in a trance.  You glide in and get on the operating table.  Now Tor, you're supposed to tie her down.  But you have an angora fetish... and when you rub that swatch of angora, it makes you refuse so Bela has to discipline you.
Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even <u>matter</u> if they're right for the part!
Nah, I'm all man.  I even fought in WW2.  'Course, I <u>was</u> wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform.
Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something!
Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
Hello.
Hello.  You're sleeping in a tuxedo.
You're not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw.  Your friend's.
You should feel lucky.  Ed's the only guy in town who doesn't pass judgment on people.
Look, it's Dr. Tom.  Hey, Dr. Tom!
Let's get married.
<u>It's uncanny</u>.
The set doesn't look right!  It looks too... empty.  Clutter it up.  Put a skeleton in the corner.  And what's that thing over there?
Too tall... too short...  And this guy doesn't work at all.
...Do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior?
Isn't it wonderful?  Bela lives!
B-but it's our money --
It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.
Ed Wood!  You came to my party.  I directed "Bride Of The Atom"!
ME?!  No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.
What if--you're vomiting?
At what point?
Yeah. I brought you some movies.
Is Mom here? I gotta talk to her.
What do you love her or something?
Come on...
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
They celebrated the common person.
Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al.
Have I ever said a bad word to you about your father?
Yes!
I'm moving out.
What do you mean "they're gonna have him die?"
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
Sure.
Ed --
Mr. Pekurny.
Hotel? What were they doing in a hotel?
I thought -- I thought he was dead.
Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...
You said that.
I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
Oh right, right! She fell down, like a...
Right, right...
Eddie? ...
Are the TV people with you?
I know you. This Shari is a passing fancy.
He had girlfriends!
Oh God. What hospital?
No.
Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it. It's "Star Search." You wanted me here because the camera comes with me.
Um, yeah, I was gonna ...
I batted!
Oh, the whole family loved him. Of course, they loved the last guy I went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me.
Why do it?
You do though, you look great.
It's... okay
Well, when you put it that way.
Can't we just --
I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done.
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
So...?
There's a list.
I need to talk.
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
You see how people look at me. Like when they ask for my autograph or say "Hi" to me... It's like I'm a basketball player or a... you know, like I'm someone.
My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut.
What do we have to do?
What's up?
What?
What are you drunk?
What is?!
In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something --
What?
Marcia's living with a singer?
Come on, Ma.
No. Two times.
No.
A few months before the election, she'd had an affair with my best friend Dave Novotny.
You could tell Dave was one of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place, and that could get a little irritating sometimes, but basically he was a real good guy.
what?
Thank you.
Around that time Diane and I were hanging out a lot at Sherry Novotny's house, giving her our love and support and helping her make it through a difficult time.
Yeah. No. I mean, you know.
I just want to get this over with, so we can have the assembly and go home. We don't have much time until eighth period.  I have other things going on, too, you know.
See, it doesn't add up. There are only 801 ballots but 803 people voted. Two votes are missing. Check the register.
Now at the end of her junior year, Tracy was poised to win the presidency of the student body.  And so far she was running unopposed.
Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.
Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.
Mr. M., I am running on my qualifications.  I would never need to resort to, you know, to vandalism like a, you know... Plus, my own best banner was torn down.  Did I do that too?
I told you!  I told you!  You're going to pay for my banner!
What a surprise.
Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  That's not what student government's about.
Jim, where the hell have you been?
Life would go on, and I would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience.
Okay, Jim. I understand.
Okay.  But is this about the posters?
This weekend.
I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
After Dave got fired, Sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce.
No, I... uh, didn't know that
Easy, tiger.  Come by after school. I'll leave Darryl with the sitter.
Yeah.
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
I'm not like you.
What...?
These are private -- these are for us.
Uhhh... teeth. Teeth.
We still have some extra ones, don't we?  Maybe we can just --
Who put you up to this?
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
So Mr. McAllister asked you to run.
Way to go, Tracy!  Isn't this exciting?
Good luck to you too, Paul.
Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today.
What do you want?
Merry Christmas.
Are you sorry she's dead?
No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
Yes.  But do you know?
He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
Look.  I want to see you again.
Come in out of the rain, Bud.
So tell me about it.
This business, Captain?
Give me one minute.
Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight.
What are you talking about?
Maybe.  I don't know.
How's it going to look on your report?
Ellis Loew.
Where's the other guy?  Buzz.
Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it.  I run call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well.  I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt.  I sense you share this feeling.
There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.  I use girls who look like movie stars.  Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.
I don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed.
I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding my report.  You know how it goes.
What do you want to know?
It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
I want to know who we give the public in contrast?  The department needs role models. Clean-cut, <u>forthright</u> men the public can admire.
I don't have time.  I have --
Gone.  Not a trace.
And?
Am I...?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
Dudley, we've been over this.
You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department?
Jack was a shame, but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin.  Through his whore girl friend.  I sent him to make the buy.  The rest is history.
Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?
No.
That's right.
You're the payoff expert.  I'm just doing my duty.
I want you to follow Bud White.
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
It's a simple question.
Rollo was a purse snatcher.  My father ran into him off duty.  He shot my father six times and got away clean.  No one even knew who he was.  I made the name up to give him some personality.
What's that for?
With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.
For the last time.  I may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect.
Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?
Really?  What did White say?
I don't hate White.  I really don't.  It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for.
Do you think I ever could've been in the running?
It's okay.  These are police.  <u>What</u> do you want?
Under the house.
You lost me, Sid.  Who?
No.  But I've got something going with Ad Vice.
Not a word.
And Reynolds?
What happened with the kid and Loew?
Nothing.
What'd he give to you?
A direct one.
Really?
You knew the deal. No contact.
The NSA?
You're crazy.
Wait.
What <u>is</u> that?
I don't know what that means.
What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!
Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate--
None of your business.
Drive.
We're not gonna hurt you.
What about newspapers and magazines?
What if--
Who's calling?
It's Pat Cary. I work for Senator Sam Albert and I was given Jerry's name.
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
Tracks your location to the inch and works directly with--you know...
You'd like to buy your wife some lingerie as a Christmas gift.
Is that good?
It's a little late for that.
<u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
About the accident.
I'm not his attorney.
Because I don't know.
Did he give you anything?
Well, you know--
It wasn't me.
Just reporters.
That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
DePinto?
It's how he works.
I <u>like</u> our history. And I like you. I'd probably like <u>Brill</u> if I ever got to--
Eat your fish.
There are reporters wanting to know about my relationship with you and how long I've worked for the mob. The <u>mob</u>, Bobby!
How?
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
We'd rather not--
Your shoe.
My shoe?
Well until we find, you're gonna have to take a leave of absence.
Put David on it. He seems anxious to clear my name.
Last night, Larry Spinks, he works the Steel Press, he goes to a bar with his wife Rosalie to have a glass of chianti 'cause it's his birthday, and these two guys, these Guido mother-fuckers, they jump him when he goes to the bathroom.
She can't talk to you right now.
Why?
Sure, go ahead.
Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon.
How long can you stay?
You've got a bunch of Armani suits, they didn't take 'em?
They didn't take the jewelry. They took the computers. They took the big-screen TV, they took my blender.
The blender?
Can I talk to you a second?
You gotta--
I have a family.
I'm just doing some Christmas shopping. It's for my wife, no kidding. Though, this isn't the <i>main</i> present, it's just, you know, a little--
No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan?
What's your opinion?
You're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? <i>Terrorism,</i> you unconscionable asshole?
There are planes falling out of the sky, buildings blowing up. <i>American</i> buildings. <i>Americans</i> getting bombs in the mail. What are we gonna do!?
He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
What about the tapes?
It was in his bag. Now it's not.
We believe?
You're kidding me.
Found him. Kent Island nailed the call five minutes ago. He's stationary.
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
We're not stupid, Reynolds.
It was pulsing on your SAT frequencies.
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
No.
I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
What is he saying?  Come on, what did he say?
You should come into the shelter.
See what's happening to them - the stars.
Don't.
Now.
Marmite - addicted!  Baths - not with other people!  Islands.  Your handwriting.  I could go on all day.  My husband. Almsy nods.
Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
This - what's it called? - this place, I love it - this is mine!  I'm asking the King permission to call it the Almasy Bosphorous.
Dance with me.
You're wearing the thimble.
And a good read.  Don't waste it.
Yes, of course.  So, golly, where have you come from?
I desperately need a jeep.  There's been an accident.
What?
Looking for the fossils.  Why should we wait until we're in London?  This girl was probably twelve years old.
I was talking about the girl.
Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
Why do they care about our maps?
Right.
Would it? She kisses him, very softly, on the lips.
Is this you?
Yes, I've been asking for weeks, a month, I don't know, also my leg was -
Well, you must know.  You were brought up Libya, yes?
Yeah, for a while.
I don't know what that means.
Have a drink.
I've had a drink.  Fatal.
So, I come across the Hospital Convoy  I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat -  how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession -  - a copy of Herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you.
And you thought you'd come and settle the score?
Thousands of people did die, just different people.
And did you never see Katharine? You never got back to the Cave?
But then the Queen looked up and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows. And though she said nothing, she shuddered. The next day she sent for Gyges and challenged him.  And hearing his story, she said this -
Darling, I just heard.  You poor sausage, are you all right?
What was all the banging?  Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?
I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes.  What about your own book?
Candaulesyou're laughing at me.
Are you remembering more?
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?
I don't think it does.  Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -
I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.
What are you up to?
When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.
I should go to the house, get breakfast.
Of course.  When?
He's gone, hasn't he?
Hello miss.
Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
A bit of one.
I had a hotel room.
Certainly not.
So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
What are you talking about?
They're excited!  They're happy about destroying a whole city. Would they do that to a White Man's City?  Never!
Am I being interrogated?  You should be trying to trick me.  Ask me about Tottenham Hotspur.  Or Buckingham Palace. About Marmite - I was addicted.  Or make me speak German, which I can, by the way.
You tell me.  I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France.
Through a window.
I don't know, but close.
I have a question...
A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes.
No you can't.
It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
I don't care about the damned car. My luggage's been stolen.
The Empress Death Mask.
I suspected it might be worthy of your interest.
Very nice.
Give him the card.
What the hell do I do now?
It's one way.
Those are my clothes.
Lose something?
And--
Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.
Pack up. I'll see you get back to London.
That's because I wanted them to!
So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
Aren't we all.
We're working.
One, two, three...
No, really, it's your plan, you should get at least 30 per cent--
Insidious thing, wondering if your partner...has another partner.
Oh my god, I thought--
Peoples China Bank.
Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it.
The oscilloscope's already programmed.
You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.
Four billion dollars.
Come on.
No way.
What's wrong.
It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.
You have the right to remain silent. But anything you say may be taken down in evidence and used against you--
You gave them the eight billion.
We need to make the trade tomorrow.
Tina was a wonderful woman.
You're not the one trying to get all this shit. You think they've just got a Crooks R Us on every corner?
If we don't bypass it, the temperature in the Mask room will change and set off the alarm. That would be inconvenient.
Let me ask you, this Mask, when they made it--was the old bitch dead or alive?
The early bird gets the damn worm.
We're supposed to.
Doesn't look like much. How come those Commos want it so bad?
Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.
Takes a lot out of you, one like this.
A million things could have caused those problems.  Poor diet, bad genes, irresponsible lifestyle.  Our offer is final and more than fair.
Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?
Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend.
Yes?
Right.
So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point.
An on-site monitoring well?  That means --
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
And get someone to help around the house.
You said things would be fine, and they're not.
I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --
How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.
Erin, you've been gone for a week.
Now, why in the hell would you assume that?
So what's the story on this thing?  This cancer stuff?
That document you found, the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen to make a copy did you?
Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the bathroom.  They'll be driving around the valley for hours.
Really?  It makes me sick.
D'you get his name?  Course not.  Jesus, Ed --
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, I didn't have time to check those things --
What kind of things come up?
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
I did.  Both.
How do you know that?
Right.
Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ...
Hey, Ross.  Tell me something.  Does PG&E pay you to cover their ass, or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
What kind of chromium is it?
Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
Every county has one.  They keep records of anything water-related within their jurisdiction.  You should be able to find something there.
Masry & Vititoe, can I help you?
Yeah.
Ooh, now, see, if I'da known there was a beautiful woman next door, I'da done this different.  Let's start over.  My name's George.  What's yours?
You got a little girl?
It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice.
What're you doing?
George, I am just trying to do something nice for my kids on my one day off.  Could you please not give me a hard time about it?
Nothing.
Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here.  Beth started talking.
Lock the door.
Thank you.
No, I need my car --
I'm embarrassed.
Jaguar's a darn pretty car.
I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine.  I don't even know how much they cost.
What am I supposed to do, check in every two seconds?
Yes.  It's called accountability.
My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me.  I'm going to move in with her.
Yes?
Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
He can do it.
I can't ...
Looking?  Looking?  You've found someone I'd say.  Heh?  Yes!
Mine, mine.
... I told you, I'm not hungry.
Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?
Because of my father, I guess.
Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?
Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in.
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
Sit down, and shut up!
If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.
What are you so grouchy about?
There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.
Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct ....
Now you're making sense.
Stop that.
There's something out there!
Not bad, hot shot, not bad.  Then what?
Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?
No hard feelings?
Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.
You're part of the mining guild then?
What's going on?
Very noble.  Not smart, but noble.
You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.
Two transports at a time is awfully risky.
I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.
Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while?
Leia!
No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
I see a city in the clouds.
And sacrifice Han and Leia?
There is no escape.  You must join me or die.  Don't make me destroy you here ... The Emperor is strong with The Force.  But if you join me, together we could overthrow Him.  Do not resist. It is our destiny!
But we saw Earth destroyed.
What, Lewis?
What are they doing here?
They look pretty docile.
Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
He doesn't look like his picture.  I bet he's fake.
You're about to get hit, Cuervo. It's Plissken.
It's so good to see you again.
Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
All right, so I made another deal.
You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?
No, that sucks.  How are we getting out?
Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there.  Once you go inside, you're on your own.  You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
She's in the green.
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride, and you came through. Not bad for a dirtbag like you.
Location.
Stop the damn car.
I said pull over.
I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.
Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
Don't follow me.
Snake - what is it?
I changed my mind. I'm going with you, wherever you're going.
Where's the anti-toxin...?
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
My King, I couldn't do it. Excalibur cannot be lost. Other men--
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
Yield. I have the advantage.
Fight me from your horse or on foot, but fight me. Your avoidance mocks me.
They miss the battlefield. I think we do too.
Don't recognize him. You were trapped by Morgana's sorcery.
Of Merlin?
Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
What book is that?
The book without pages. Open before you, all around us. You can see it in bits and pieces, for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance, why, it would burn him to cinders.
I love her. If she would be my queen, my dreams would be answered.
Merlin, tell me. Now that Guenevere is returned to me...
Yes.
I left it in the tent, sir.
He must stay for the feasting days of our wedding, and tell his deeds himself.
I loved you much, as King, and sometimes as husband, but one cannot gaze too long at the sun in the sky.
I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...
Behold the sword of power, Excalibur. Before Uther, it belonged to Lud, before Lud, to Beowulf, before Beowulf to Baldur the Good, before Baldur to Thor himself and that was when the world was young and there were more than seven colors in the rainbow.  Speak the words.
--What issues from your lust will be mine. Swear it again.
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
Well why are they tearing the building down?
How about Lankaster Merrin.
It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.
I didn't know that.
Quite frankly, we don't know much about it except that it's starts with some conflict or guilt that eventually leads to the patient's delusion that his body's been invaded by an alien intellegence; a spirit if you will.
Maybe the circuit is busy?
Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!
What the hell do you mean going out and leaving Regan by her self! What are you kidding her window's wide open...
We still don't know.
Groceries maybe? A package?
I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.
Yes, I go now.
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
No. Of course not, nothing like that.
That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
On what?
The priest.
No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.
You could do it yourself...
No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,-
Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or studied.
Have you told him what's happening?
I told Regan that was holy water, I sprinkled some on her and she reacted very violently. It's tap water.
Yes. He's already here.
Oh............
We'll see when we get home okay.
What are we gonna do on your birthday, isn't that nice it's on a Sunday this year, what can we do?
Your not gonna marry him are you?
What?
People get tired.
Goodbye Father. I call you.
That's an insult, I got a vow of poverty.
I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras.
Your mother's in here with us Karras, would you like to leave a message? I'll see that she gets it.
He broke the bread, gave it to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you and eat. For this is my body." When the supper had ended, he took the cup, again he gave you thanks and praise. Gave the cup to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you will drink from it, this is the cup of blood, the blood of the new and ever lasting covenant and the mystery of faith".
Intensely.
No now.
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
No momma.
Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation.
Let the enemy have no power over her.
What is it?
Her heart.
Can you give her something?
I once did a paper on it
I don't know anyone who fits the description.
Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he knew about a patient.
...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!!! It is he who commands you! He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to the depths of hell!
Yes?
Yes
Are you a relative?
Who is it?
Why not?
If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you. Do you want him to leave you?
Now?  Why not tomorrow?  After the show.
Right, twelve years.  Couple times a month.
Isn't there something you can give him?  A pill or something?
Knee.  Tore it up against St. Anthony's.  Right before the accident.
Twenty years, Ma ...
Oh no!
Frank.
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
Funny.  Strike a bell?
So do I.
Your older brother.
What's with Charlie?
Jack.
Nice, huh?
Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?
I don't know what you mean.
No.
Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk.
I'm not unhappy.
Let's get it over with.
What's the matter?
Where the hell is she?
She'll get here.
Yeah, well, Your's isn't.  Let me run a comb though it.
Make it collect.
Yeah.  Something.
Just a lucky guess.
I figure that way we won't get confused.
Good idea.
Thank you, thank you.  You know, Susie and Jack and I only just arrived here yesterday, but already the people here at the King Corporation's Moorish Manor have made us feel, well, a part of the family. And it's their hope that, before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part of that family also.  So, if during-the next few days, we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger. Stop.  Say hello.  Introduce yourself.  Because here, there are no strangers, only friends. And family.  Right, Jack?
Right.  I love you, Frank.
What the hell are you doing?
They stopped serving two hours ago.
She's a big girl.
What?
You saw wrong.
Huh?
What are you talking about?
Expensive hangover.
He was just having fun.
You're making things up, Frank.
What do you mean?
It's a disease, Jack.  We're against it. It's not a moral decision.
Seventy-one
I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
What're you doing?
Right.
Five years ago.  November.
You sure?
But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche.  If you ask for Monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up.
This is where the auditions were.
This is show business?
Just like that, huh?  You're not even gonna give me a chance?
Terrific.  Thirty-eight.
So?
When?
Where's my name?
We'll talk about it later.  Right now, you gotta get changed.
What's he talking about?
Save it for your wife.
For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it.  Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?
We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men.
Go ahead.
And how about this air? I'm telling you, a few days in this place'll put five years on your life.
What're you talking about?  They love it.
I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?
Gotta go.
Baker.
Black.  Labrador.
Yes, well, it's probably best. No sense bringing someone else in.
You miss him, don't you?
Fucking.
Can't sleep?
How do you do it? Every night?
You were good.
I have to make him some chili. Okay?
Soap convention.
My father proposed to my mother in there.
Wow.  But I still don't see how ...
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.
Saw the sign outside.  Got your own sign, huh?
We outgrew each other.
So how's the cat food business?
What kind?
Listen... you want to get a drink?  I got a new place.  Or we could go to a bar ...  Well, maybe not a bar.  But I know a place uptown, if you want --
Sneak out in the morning.  Before the guy could wake up and ruin it.  Never figured I'd be on the other end of it, though.
Yeah.
Losing his teeth.
Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
Did you break a cup, Jack?
Process server. Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular.  All I know's he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner.  And breakfast.
What are they?
Oh.  Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
Oh?
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
Sure.
Don't they ever let us take these boots off?
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
I hear you're a manicurist now -- got your own business and everything.  I'm glad you've stayed clean.
After that.  You promised you'd always take care of me.
I'm late for surgery.
So you had a nightmare.
No.
I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
You can't go.  You can't be anywhere near that place.
I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.
How's Loomis?
Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
It can't be.  It's impossible.
Stay away from my family!
Jamie ...
You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!
You always call me Miss Brewster.
I can't even look at you without wanting to vomit.
Eight pocket stingers ... seven piper uzis ... six cobra carbines ...  five - net - launch-ers ...
Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
All of them do.  We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb.  And we'll be rich.
You'll need to recultivate that virus.
Look at you, Jon -- at your age -- an American hero!  I'd buy you a drink but I know you'd just turn me down.
What's that?
Hurry up -- the salad's getting warm and the pasta's getting cold.
You always say that -- then you leave.
I'll deal with her later.
Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college.  I almost married her...
God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybodys here.
Mr. Mintz.
On a case by case basis...
You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
This is day care.  Its where babies go when their parents are at work.
Dont you think thats a little gimmicky?
Thats good but...you did forget the anniversary.
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
What are you doing?
Is it morning yet?
Were friends, arent we?
Im telling you, those rules dont apply to me, Arn.
What the hell are you talking about?  Whats he talking about?
Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise itll be returned!
Got a minute, Jack?
Yeah?  What do you need?
You still think this is about me, don't you?
Brought what on myself?! I didnt do anything!
But what do I do?
Something like that.
Uh...sure Jack...  Right back there...
About the plane? What do you think its gonna crash? Dont say that...
Where were you?
Look, we dont have time for this right now, well talk about it later.  Now get dressed...  Youre not wearing that to the Thompsons party. I dont care how hilarious you think it is...
I mean...wow...off the charts great.
Look, Im sorry.  Im sorry I was such a saint before and Im such a prick now.  Maybe Im just not the same guy I was when we got married...
Good, Jack.  Maybe well keep her.
Thank you...
Heres the thing.  I really hadnt planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight.  You know, anniversarys good all day...
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
Youre so...beautiful...
Pretty incredible, isnt it?
Are you out of your mind?
Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
Promise me again...
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
Not by a long shot.
He certainly has your number, Alan.
Damn...damn...damn...
Do you want me to look for the box or call the airline?
Three days.  I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Are you alright?
Where...where am I?
Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
Ben?
What are <u>you</u> doing here?
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
He didn't.
Oh, he did.
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Not this again --
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl...the Invisible Girl.
You two need a time-out.
Sis.  Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
Yes, thanks.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...
Are you kidding?
Why didn't you say something?
Please don't make this personal --
'Scuse me.
Okay to proceed.
<Cardiac Red Alert> we're stopping the Heart.
They're in the Pulmonary Artery.
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.
It's only for an hour --
Doctor...
Yes, Cora.
Cora, is something wrong with the laser?
Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
Shouldn't you answer that?
No, it requires such absolute precision --
Such as?
We better get back to the sub. Every second counts now.
Doctor, what's wrong?
But that isn't possible.
What can we do?
I've done all I could with the laser.
The Soul? The finite mind cannot comprehend Infinity. And the Soul which comes from God is Infinite.
If there's any chance --
That line was tampered with...
Where we going?
Atomic fuel?
If it's no military secret, how can a sub run on a microscopic particle?
All in all, quite a canoe...
Designed for Piscatorial Research -- the Spawning Habits of Deep Sea Fish.
Captain, how will you be able to follow my charts --  --from up there?
Well, that takes care of the valve. It was probably caused by that electric shock.
I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you?
I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase!
Where's my daughter?
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
Can I see your license and registration please?
Where is Pancakes Hause?
...Come on, man. Okay, here's an idea. We'll stop outside of Brainerd. I know a place there we can get laid. Wuddya think?
I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
Okay.
Okay, it's - see, it's not me payin' the ransom. The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy - her dad, he's real well off. Now, I'm in a bit of trouble -
What kind of trouble are you in, Jerry?
What the heck're you talkin' about? Let's just finish up this deal here -
...Blood has been shed.
GOT IT?
Ya got that right.
And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead and I don't mean a old age.' And then he says, 'Geez, I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake.'
Oh sure.
So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I don't think a whole great deal of it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought I should call it in, so I called it in. End a story.
Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'.
Uh-huh.
A subconscious-type thing.
Yah, that can happen.
Uhn.
Okay. Well, that's why we don't want ya goin' out fer hockey.
Good to see ya again, Jerry. If these numbers are right, this looks pretty sweet.
We're not horse-trading here, Wade, we just gotta bite the bullet on this thing.
So you're goin' to the Gophers on Sunday?
What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?
Dad, I really think we should call the cops.
Mr. Lundegaard?
Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you about yesterday. I was just wondering -
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.
Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doin' my job here.
...If it's so damned important to ya!
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.  You're damned hard to get on the phone.
That's for sure. Now, I just need, on these last, these financing documents you sent us, I can't read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here, so I -
But I already got the, it's okay, the loans are in place, I already got the, the what, the -
No, fax is no good, that's what I have and I can't read the darn thing -
Know who this is?
Yah!
Yah.
Good day, sir.
Stan Grossman called.
You told me about it.
No kiddin'! I'd need the cash pretty quick there. In order to close the deal.
Yah.
Stan and I're okay.
Yah.
I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.
Yah?
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
You don't think he's mixed up in -
Yah?
How we doin' on that vehicle?
...You can sleep, hon. It's early yet.
Oh, yah, a long time ago.
And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.
Well, they're a good outfit.
It sounds like you're doin' really super.
...I'm sorry... I shouldn't a done this... I thought we'd have a really terrific time, and now I've...
Nope.
Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater.
Yah, is this Marge?
Margie Olmstead?
No. No. They never married.  Mike's had psychiatric problems.
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
Yah?
Yah.
When they're stuck with a bunch a the old ones!
Uh-huh.
That wouldn't interest you.
Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
Bob was a champion bodybuilder.  You know that chest expansion program you see on TV?  That was his idea.
No.  I found something new.
Oh.
And the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule...
That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking great! Congratulations.
I'm going to need you out-of-town a little more this week.  We've got some "red-flags" to cover.
It must've been Tuesday.  he was wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.
Is that your blood?
We need to talk.
Let's pretend.  You're the Department of Transportation, and you discover that our company intentionally did nothing about leather seats cured in third world countries with chemicals we know cause birth defects?  Brake linings that fail after a thousand miles.  Fuel injectors that burn people alive.
I don't know if you're aware... your front door -- it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means?
This is... really a shock...
Practicing what?
These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.
We'll split up the week.  You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --
You're kidding.
It's for men.
What... ?
Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape.
This is a sweet side of you.  Picking these up for ...  "Mrs. Haniver" and... "Mrs. Raines." Where are they?
I think everything's okay here.
Guy or girl?
He's not here.
Yeah?
You fuck me, then snub me.  You love me, you hate me.  You show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole!  Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler?
Say my name!  What's my name!?
Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the plane.  We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy.
I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
Who do you think I am?
Excuse me?  "Throwers?"
-- But, in here, in everyone, there's the squint of a five-day headache. Yet they forced themselves to be positive.  They never said "parasite;" they said "agent."  They always talked about getting better.
Insurance'll cover it.
It's called a "changeover."  The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea.
But a good strange.
Anyone?
Alive or dead?
Doesn't matter.
Any historical figure.
You're sure?
If you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house, to her or anyone -- I will find out.  And you'll never see me again.  Promise me.
Promise you won't.
No, I'm not...
It isn't... ?
You quit?
I'm not asking you to.
This conversation...
What's this all about, Tyler?
Answer me, Tyler.
What... ?
This isn't possible...
You have jobs.
What about Marla?
Stop finishing...
I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you know which wires, in what order...
If I'm wrong, we're both dead..
I've got everything.  The bombs.  The army.  I've got Marla.
Ask me nicely.
What?
Why... why... why... ?
You need me.
What have you left for me?
Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?
Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy?
Look at me...
What?
Maintenance.
Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
What he wanted?  Look... look at him. Look at him!  What does he want?  This is a person.  This is not a cog in your machine...
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
Really?
Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning, apartment A.  A small, cramped basement apartment.
Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
Congratufuckinglations.  That makes you last to go.  But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.  Always does.
If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon.  When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your-face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it.  It usually means the difference between life and death.
I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...
What are you doing?  You're going to kill us!
This makes no sense.  Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake.  Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested?
What did you see?
No!  It can't be.
Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
So if you never got off the plane, none of us would be alive in the first place.
That lucky bastard.
Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?
Tell me you didn't start up on that Flight 180 shit again.  Did you?
What was the fight about?
I didn't.  Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors.
I'm not following you --
Nora's not coming.  She refuses to leave her son.
Are you okay?  You just face planted!
But it's over.  Isabella's baby was the key.  You saw her die and everything, right?
This trip better be worth it. What's the guy-girl ratio again?
What's the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to Daytona?
Your mother would have been so proud of the way you've handled yourself through all of this...
I used to have those feelings, too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage.  And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was.  And the bad thoughts would go away.
Mom?
I'm... really sorry.
4:25.
Stop the car!
No! No! Don't!
Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.
Cuticle lacerations.
... there are no accidents. No coincidencess. No mishaps.  And no... escapes.
Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one...
Insertion.  Call in to base camp by TRANSAT.  Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact.  Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao.  We've been over this three times.
Gettin' old, huh?
No radio source.  Nothing for the bad guys to triangulate on.
Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
You never been in one of those things.
I thought he was with you.
Nguyen.  He twelve now.  Not see him for eight years.
It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.
We like you.  At least the computer at Langley likes you.  Pulled your file because of various factors.  Service record. Area familiarity.
We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
All this is for us?
Typical...
POWs?  I don't know.  But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks.  Cream?
What's up?
Take your time.
But you're right... some people do get sacrificed.  Now tell me why you pulled the plug.
Look, it was a screw-up, alright? They weren't supposed to find anything.  We thought that camp was empty.
Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.
Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
I like your nails.  Where did you get them done?
Meeting ... people.
Oh, no..I have to get home...
I'm not seeing anyone else.  I really was attacked.
Lydia?!  Lydia who!?
I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second.
The moron?
Well talk back.  He won't bite you.
What do you think?
... Listen, so much has happened and I think it would be a good thing for both of us if we slowed things down a little.
Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?  He'll snap out of it?
She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate...
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
I... I was just leaving.
Can I ask that when you clean your hands you wipe the ink off the inside of the sink before it stains the stainless steel.
No, I have to work.
So how do we do this?
Now what?
Have I died?
<u>What</u>?!
Him...?
That's O.K.
Will you shut-up!!!
You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
The Red Knight!
What?
OWWW....What are you nuts?!
Parry Parry?
How about the "Hell Merchants"?
What a gyp.
We mostly publish trashy romance novels.
What do you do - for a living I mean?
Don't say that.
You don't have to say that.
What are we about to do?
I don't drink coffee...
I leave it to you.
Come on. We're goin' over to Elton's.
You treat me like I was.
You're depressed that I come along.
I'm gonna go in that cafe an' get some coffee. You want anything?
I saw a picture of it. Alaska is very clean. It appeared to look very white to me... Don't you think?
We been wantin' to ask you something. Are you the guy on YV?
I'm gonna give you our number, Donnie, just in case...  We're both professionals, if you didn't guess.
Robert Eroica...
Everybody still up on the Island?
What?
Well...  I better let you...
No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
I mean, you think I'm that happy?
No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?
Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...
Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...
I think he's got a terrific personality.
It's none of your business!
What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.
That's dangerous, you know.
Right now I'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself.
After that, I plan to read some music and rest for awhile.
The day after tomorrow.
It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.
What?
You think I'm a fake.
Yes, it was. You've made it clear that if I can cut a little piano, I might get a little response.
No, don't do that...
As a matter of fact, he's the one who introduced me to Carl...  How are you?
Is he?
Robert?
What?
I have to talk to you.
She's tremendously gifted, this girl.
What?
You sure you should be playing, Carl?
Robert, I think you better just...
You've been staying in a motel all this time?
It is true.
You haven't dampened my spirit, Samia... Excuse me.
You better hold onto your tongue!
Yeah, it could be adorable...
If you want to call it that.
Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.
Hi.
You know somebody around here?
So what's her name?
You got a boyfriend?
So what you think of me?
Come down!
I got punished, man.
Fa what?
Wha'?
Yeah! Tell me which one you would like. To be doin' nothin on a fire escape or beat the pool with a bunch of girls? Be straight up!
I gotta go take a piss.
Near Natasha's? Or over by Boy's Club?
How old is he?
What she look like?
Positive.
You wanna do somethin' with me?
Yeah.
We'd have no way of knowing that, sir.
Sally Ann Cavanaugh. Oh wait, she couldn't work in your office, she's not from around here.
I wasn't asking.
Hey, what are you doing?
Fletch, this is dumb.
Full name.
Can I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much I've always loved her.
Not a prayer.
Greetings, everyone.
Jerry, you're simply going to have to trust me. I've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy and now you're jeopardizing everything.
Really. The California Racquet Club?
Your aunt?
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
Just relax....
Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
No idea at all?
Like tonight.
No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes. You gonna want some shit?
Jesus.
You don't know me.
Affirmative.
My associates did a biopsy on this man recently.  He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it.
That's it?
What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
Why don't you check it out for yourself, Mr. Nugent?
I was already prepared to commit one murder. What makes you think I won't commit two?
Right.
Yes. Where you from, Harry?
Regulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your wife, named....
Velma. You and Velma are the parents of Alan Stanwyk, Beverly Hills, California, executive vice president of Boyd Aviation?
Isn't that nice. Since when?
Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann.
That's Brazil.
You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks.
I will be here in the room, waiting for you. The safe will be open and there will be fifty thousand dollars in it. You will be wearing rubber gloves. Do you own rubber gloves?
A .357.
Do you have a passport?
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
Yo!
Can I steal you for a minute?
Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
'Stanwyk's parents, Marvin and Velma Stanwyk, also of Provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'
You doing a story on this guy?
'...Stanwyk, blahblahblah, with internist Doctor Joseph Dolen.'
John Ultrarelamensky.
Preoccupied with what?
Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
I mean put clothes on.
It's amazing.
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.
I think you should call me Gail, now.
Yeah.
I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?
So?
He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad.
I'll take you to a game.
I think you better sit down.
Oh God, I hate things that start like that....
I'm calling the police. Right now.
Charged to the Underhills, sir?
Lock's busted.
What?
Who are you?
I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.
I'm calling the cops. This is for the cops.
Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
What's the spread on the game tonight?
How gray?
You're onto something. That's good. What?
It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.
You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
Fletch, you want an apology?
But I ain't got you...
Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
Oh, that!  Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy!  Roseanne Barr naked!
Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.
My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon.
So you know about Johnny Crunch and myself.
G'day, they say it's worth three grand...
Aha, just what I suspected!
People still watch that?
Zuzu, wake up...
Hah fluck, great video, huh?
Ford, you were right!
This way...
As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'
Pretty smooth, huh?
Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny.
Hello, Mr. Tongue!  What a perv.
Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?
Where's my father?  Have you even looked?
It's me.
Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...
Two words.  Disco Express.
Off what?  Twenty seconds...
The point?
Well, hello, Ford.
Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end.  Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
Uh, nice piano.  Probably get a lot of complaints from the neighbors -- heh...  It's another time, Julian, another place.  If I told you Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and Colleen Sutton were the ones you were complaining about, the ones who tried to rip you off, what would your reaction be?
And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
Yeah, yeah, I know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits.  Shit, just start torturing me, man.  I didn't even know Johnny had a disc and I can't deal with any 'Don't play games with me, Mr. Fairlane' bullshit.
It doesn't have to be like this?
Man, Julian, that accident took away more than your hearing.
I'm still the king!
How nice.
Mr. Doyle.
No, nothing.  There's only some talk.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
My friend, I am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, I am finished.
Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite?
We must follow it.
I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.
There may be two... no, three who could fit it.
Des Moines.
And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I don't know what he does.
Why not?
A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
Morning.  Sometime.
Never trust a nigger.
If that's not a drop or a pickup, I'll open a charge for you at Bloomingdale's.
Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.
No sir -- this is where Joel lives.
What was it?
For garbage?
Sexual assault, Daryl.  Five years.  But you got lucky, right?  You got away with something else.  Something you figured nobody knows about.
I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him?
Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad.
Don't know what's behind it.
You alright?
What's the matter, Jules?  Trouble workin' an eight hour shift, watching the kid and whipping up a little bolognese?
Wish you weren't.
Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is here John.  You hear me?  Satch is here.
Uh, huh.
Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.
Deleon.
Don't be scared.  This time I'm right behind you if you fall.
Uh, hello?
Listen, you can't broadcast without a license.  Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band.
You call your son Little Chief?
Now you listen to me.  My name is John Francis Sullivan, I live at 1060 41st, where I've lived my whole life.  And I saw the first game of the '69 Series at my Uncle Butch's house with my father...
29 years...?
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
I think I'm losing you.
What are you talking about?
Dad, you there?  You okay?
What kinda twisted animal.
No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different.
You ever talk to a victim's family?  The one's left behind?  They don't act like what you'd think.  There's panic and fear.  But mostly, it's like there's this logic problem.  And if they could only solve it, everything would be okay.  But if you look real close - look at their eyes - you can see it.  Just a glimmer.  But somewhere they know.  They know their world is never gonna be the same.
It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
Dad, I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard.
Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.
Yeah, you betcha.
What?
Dad, what the hell is going on?
What's wrong?
Hey, Sull.  My cable's out again.
C'mon, man.  Get inside.  I'll come over. We'll play some Nintendo.
Don't choke on your pride, Sull.  You ain't ever gonna catch another one like that.
Another rough night, huh?  That it?
Hey, future boy.  Frank tells me you're a cop?
My six year-old here keeps telling me he wants to be a policeman.  Right after he retires from the majors.  We just gave him a badge and a whistle for his birthday.
You used to be on the job?
Nah, just working the job.
Fuck you, asshole.
My name is Abel.  And I am my brother's keeper.
That's an eyeball!  Oh, God!
Look Shelly, you're my roommate and I like you... most of the time.  But you gotta stop doing these things.  Now, I set this date up for you, didn't I?  So don't embarrass me.  When you meet this woman, just relax and be yourself.
What's this?
I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
You know him?
Faster!  Eat faster!
That scarecrow?  Can't you tell how weird his is just by looking at him.
Everything's gonna be fine.
See anything?
If this thing is burned out, friggin' Horace will ground my butt.
Go out and plug the cord back in.
Don't worry about it.  Just stay cool.
When are you going to stop treating me like one!
I thought Jason was only a legend?
You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
Well, let's hope not!
Good night, beautiful.
Where the fuck is she, Duke?!
For a good reason.
Tell me.
Lock this asshole up.
Oh, c'mon, would you stop, please?
Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?
Sorry, I'm working now.  You see, I have a job...
Well?
Until I hear the truth.
I've told you the truth.
That's a lie.  Diana would never talk to you about Jessica.  Not after what you did to her.
That's disgusting.
But she might be in trouble...
It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best.
What murders?
All right, all right -- I'm a major ass.
And you'll never do it again.
But I thought...
They're out of town.
I thought I told you to stay away from her.
You're making a big mistake, Rennie. It's not too late to put you back on land.
I'm staying.
Get in the boat, Rennie!
I can't swim.
Did you have an accident in the lake?
I got you a present.
But I didn't get you one...
Rennie...what'd they do to you??
Very big.
What do you mean, we must abandon?
Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
This is a great young out-of-work actress.
You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.
It's just a review.
It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
Do you want me to tell you what it was like, reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing Mecca?
I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life.
Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else.
It makes me so mad. Steven Schwimmer ready to strike. The exterminating angel.
Do you want to get some coffee?
Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
Why won't you tell me your name?
Yes.
What do we want?
I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.
I'll have whatever she's having.
Opening night, Lillian.
That's very lovely actually.
There may be things you'd rather not know about.
I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
Life is good.
Nicky comes on Sunday's.
If it's you, what are you doing here?
I'm on my way to get a haircut.
It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
But the son is suppose to stop crying.
I can't find it.
`Why doesn't he come live with us?' Because everything is here.
So what are you going to do about it?
What do you want me to do?
Now that's a complicated subject.
You're a family man, Frankie?
An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
It's a complicated subject.
Life is good.
Washed away.
Don't worry. It's a test.
This could be it!
I hate the Mets.
How come?
Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
Burnt sienna.
I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?
I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.
He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.
You've come to me. I wanted to believe you would one day.
Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs.
Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.
Stay. Teach me to be compassionate.
In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!
Please! You're being foolish!
"...what shape it will take." Jinnah has -- what?
You'd be Gandhi --  ...I thought you'd be bigger.
I'm sorry.
You're a clergyman.
Tell me -- do you think about hell?
I'll take your luggage back, baas.
What can we do?
He's waiting. He's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think.
Is it over if they arrest you now?
I must say when I first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay I never thought I'd be greeting you as a national hero.
They are preparing for war. I will not support it, but I do not intend to take advantage of their danger.
You mean you employ Mr. Baker as your attorney, but you can't walk down the street with him?
Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.
He was right. It's insane -- anything would have been better.
Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed child?
How much extra?
I guess so.  Well, while you're up there, maybe you could tidy the place up a bit.
And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.
No, <i>this</i> is your man.
A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
What are you waiting for?
We believe we have a suspect.
Good to see you're feeling better.
You had to be a right-hander.
God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
It's not too late to back out.
The Mission Director.
You wish.
He was still warm when they confirmed.
And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
What are you talking about?
What makes them think that?
You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
If you say so.  The stripe.
I don't feel too good.  I think I'm still drunk from last night.
Where are you taking her?
Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself.
Why have you done this?
Anything I've forgotten?
What will happen to the others?
He has the heart of an ox.  He could run through a Goddamn wall--if he could still run. Actually, he was a big college swimming star.
Yeah.
These new personality corrections I've been reading about.
Hugo!  I've found him!
It was a mercy-killing after all.
You'll be next.
So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
Half a million.
What do you want for dinner?
Nothing's been boring since you found me.
Yeah, well, I think I'll stick with what I've got.
It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
What about the bank?
When I got out, why didn't you tell me where it was?
What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore?
No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
What?
Are you hungry?
Okay?
Okay.
What is it?
You're crazy.
You okay?
I don't know, airport I guess.
Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
That's right.
Me, neither. There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm one of them.
Oh my God.
What about the vault?
One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
I'll hang on to these. We don't need them till we get to Gollies. Okay. Any questions?
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
Then you do it.
How was that?
And I keep my mouth shut?
You're going to have to walk back to the border.
Hello, Jack,  I don't know anything, Jack.
Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
You can't get away from me, Albert.
You knew what I'd do.
Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear.  Kinnear did it.
Jack, you're wrong.
Confidential, like.
Really.
I can't.
Nothing more? Just another feller?
I call that regular.
Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?
You've been watching the film.
What girl?
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
Did my brother Frank find out?
Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
That must be interesting.
Wilton Estate.
It just would. He was always the same.
Keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know. Right?
Heard of a man called Thorpe?
Get knotted.
Stuff it! My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight.  Nice surprise, isn't it?
Ta.
Inside? Why should I give house- room to your sort?
Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
You wouldn't.
How'd you know I wouldn't?
What's that supposed to mean?
No. I'm visiting relatives.
Oh, that's nice.
Meaning what?
They're still the same. Piss holes in the snow.
Yep.
Do you know, I never knew he worked in one of my places!
We've got to take you back to London.
Put it away, Jack. You know you won't use it.
Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?
That's right, Harry.
How about that, Jack?  Old Harry thought I was having him on.
Deadbeats all.
I'm not?
They did.
And now...
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
Eh?
I...
Eh...?
That's right?
Shoes, boots, yes...
Yes.
I heard that they were running cold.
The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.
That's the truth...
You...
You build it!
They have...
I want to tell you what somebody should do.
How many leads have we got?
Yes.
How do you know he'd buy them?
We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.
Well.  Well...
Yes.  I said, "Not actually." The fuck you care, George?  We're just talking...
Is that what I said?
What?
Yes.
That's ridiculous.
Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...?
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucked on the board.  You.  You see how...I...  I can't...my mind must be in other places. 'Cause I can't do any...
Clear...
That's not...Fuck that shit, George. You're a, hey, you had a bad month. You're a good man, George.
That's great.
Who used to say that?
I, um, and may...maybe they're in... they're in...you should, John, if we're ins...
...that's why I came in.  I thought I...
Fuck insured.  You owe me a car.
Could I...
Lately kiss my ass lately.  That isn't how you build an org...talk, talk to Murray.  Talk to Mitch. When we were on Peterson, who paid for his fucking car?  You talk to him.  The Seville...?  He came in, "You bought that for me Shelly." Out of what?  Cold calling.  Nothing. Sixty-five, when we were there, with Glen Ross Farms?  You call 'em downtown.  What was that?  Luck? That was "luck"?  Bullshit, John. You're burning my ass, I can't get a fucking lead...you think that was luck.  My stats for those years? Bullshit...over that period of time...?  Bullshit.  It wasn't luck. It was skill.  You want to throw that away, John...?  You want to throw that away?
Money.  A fortune.  Money lying on the ground.  Murray?  When was the last time he went out on a sit? Sales contest?  It's laughable. It's cold out there now, John. It's tight.  Money is tight.  This ain't sixty-five.  It ain't.  It just ain't.  See?  See?  Now, I'm a good man--but I need a...
Yes.
Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me?
You start closing again, you'll be on the board.
What are we going to say?
Because I say so.
I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago.  They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...
Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...
Mmm.
No.  It hadn't.
Because I don't like you.
"'Why?  Why don't I get the opportunities...?"
Fuck you, Dave...
Harriett...
Glad to meet you.
No...Black Creek.  Yes.  In Florida?
Mr. Morton's with American Express... he's...  I can tell Jim what you do...?
Home cooking...
Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta...
Mmmm...
I've got to talk to you...
If we wait till Mon...
What is?
What's going on here?
We're going to speak to her.
No, no.  That's just something she "said." We don't have to do that.
The deal.
It means, Dave, you haven't closed a good one in a month, none of my business, you want to push me to answer you.  And so you haven't got a contract to get stolen or so forth.
I'm going home.
They didn't get your contract.  I filed it before I left.
They got, listen to me...
Yes.
Patel?  Ravidam Patel?  How am I going to make a living on thses deadbeat wogs?  Where did you get this, from the morgue?
Three?  I count two.
It was nothing...I was assuring Mr. Lingk...
Mr. Lingk.  James Lingk.  Your contract went out.  Nothing to...
I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
You've grown so tall... so tall in the last year.  You're much taller than me.
I was taller than you when I was fourteen.
Mr. Cicci.  From the year 1927 to the present time, you were an employee of the &quot;Genco Olive Oil Company.&quot;
That's right.
Your friend lives in a fine building.
What if we don't pay?
It means we should all live happily for one hundred years.  The family. If my Father were alive, it'd be true.
Goddamn bitch.
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
I don't want to stay here...
It's not talk; I'm doing it.
He will grow strong.
Otherwise the police will come to see you and your wife and children will be dishonored and destitute. Of course, if my information as to your gains is incorrect, I'll dip my beak just a little.  Just a little, but no less than one hundred dollars, and don't try to deceive me, eh paisan?
Ten to one shot, you said.  Ten to one shot in my favor, and I lose.
We were all upset about that.
It's all right.  He stays with me all the time.
It was hard to have him killed.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
Beautiful.
What did I tell you.  The one who cut him was found in an alley.  And the family of the others paid Fanucci all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance.
I'm supposed to stay in my house.
I'm going to see my parents.
That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not your best side.
Okay, just hear me out.  What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed?  What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what?  And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?  What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?
Talk to him.  Tell him how you feel.
Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.
I don't think so.  Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.
What was it, so I'll know.
Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a stroke but he's recovered okay. Bussetta's dead.
Go on, tell me.
What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!
Mike, it would be like trying to kill the President; there's no way we can get to him.
I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If there's anything certain; certain in life; if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill...  ANYBODY.  But perhaps your relucatance is because you've come to tell me that you're moving your family to Vegas, that you've been offered the Vice-Presidency of the Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't you going to tell me at all?
The High Court of Israel turned down his request to live as a 'returned Jew.' His passport's been invalidated except for return to the U.S.  He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday, offered a gift of one million dollars if they would give him citizenship.  They turned him down.
Did my brother go back?
The Roman Empire... when a plot against the Emperor failed, the plotters were always given a chance to let their families keep their fortunes.
You paid off thirty grand I never owed.
Yes, Michael, it does.
Where?
You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?
You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I have much to learn from you.
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
You have to be careful what you say in front of the others... they frighten easy.  It's always been that way, most men frighten easy.
Terrible.  I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting.
Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
Let him gamble.
Is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas?
I know.
Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.
They feel cheated.
Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean.
No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed.
You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
Don Corleone, I wish you let me know you was coming.  We could have prepared something for you.
It would be the beginning of the end for my family.  How can I keep all my other territories in like if I let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them?
Always... But sometimes I don't understand.  I know I'll never have your kind of brains, in big deals. But Mike, this is a street thing. And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind the Rosato Brothers.
I thought we would meet alone.
He don't want to talk?
Don't I look like I'm listening?
I have already rented the apartment to another family.
Your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me, and I want to show that I, too, have some Christian charity.  Her rent will remain what it was.
Fuck you.
Don't worry, you already paid me. I'm here because --
I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
What kind of man are you?  Are you a good man?
Yeah, I'm a good man.  Something make you think I'm not?
Something I can do for you?
You ever been married, Hanna?
You did not know?
When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you.  Please, Mr. Boone.  Help yourself.
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
Broke is more like it.
I apologize for going on like this. It's the Sunday painter in me.  Of course I can understand your refusal.  It's a great deal to ask of someone.
Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.
It is.  Only the poorest families ever ate it.  We kept ours in a crockery jar.
How are you, Mr. Boone?  So glad you are free for lunch.
Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon?
Can't today.
Sorry.  I don't feel like sitting still today.
Everybody has stories to tell.
Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?
Just go.  Please.  Why don't you go?
What did I tell you?  Listen.
Are you enjoying yourself?
Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place.
Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
Do I have any other choice?
But you said --
My old man was a Marine.  He enlisted the day he turned seventeen.
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out.
The morning after Pearl Harbor, he drove down to St. Louis to reenlist.  He was so damn excited. World War II was going to be his second chance.  They told him he was too old...fat ...nearsighted.  Said he'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family.
What happened?
That's from your movie, right? "The only monsters are here."
Oh, but it does.  Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make.
You survived it.  It can't hurt you now.  It's no good to dig it up.
I haven't done a damn thing with you!
Oh Clayton.
Can't say that I have.  Can't say I've heard of a lot of people though.
Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
So what do I do?
Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.
Oh no, my dear.  You look absolutely amazing.  There's no way I can compete with you.  The scene is yours.
Bring a mirror.  Let the Bride feast upon her visage.
Yes, yes, yes.  I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea. We'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard.
Oh, that monster.  How could you be working with him?
He is not going to kill the old man?
I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
It needs a hat.  There was a wide-brimmed cream fedora...
Of course.
Okay.  "Frankenstein."  Tell me everything.
I think about that night a lot...
I'm not interested --
This is how you're spending my time? Having a sock hop?
I know you --
I remember us having made some kind of deal, Randall. I don't remember this deal having some kind of time-limit. I look at you - here - in my town - and I'm confused...
Kip.
You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
Not my girl anymore
What's wrong with it -- ?
The other day....
Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
It's all microchips and shit ...
You mean the poor --
Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn."
Walked like a bastard... Skippin' stones and shit..
What does that mean -- ?
The photo album. I get nostalgic around this time of year ...
Okay, then ... I just go to the Marriott and I'm set ...
"Carol." A 198 Mercedes ... She lives in the suburbs ...
You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
This has nothing to do with any of that --
All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
You okay -- ?
I heard you were pumping gas -
Something like that -
You're kind of cultivating a new look.
Me.
You hear me?
Nah.
I dunno. Whatever will be will be...
I've missed you, man ...
Ya gotta keep tabs on your "Eleanors", Memphis. Cos you never know when you're gonna need one --
Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.
You want me to buy her?
Where we going -- ?
Call 'em here -- ?
I left town. I didn't leave you.
That's Mirror Man ... And that's Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ... Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They call her "Sway."
What's wrong with her -- ?
Right. Great car. One of a kind. I was looking forward to that boost myself
No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...
C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can you prep 'em -- ?
"Unlock my button" ... ?
They're factory alarms ... Easy to get around... For a man with... Skills...
Are you considering a comeback tour?
Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ...
This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now.
So she flies -
So what's in there -- ?
How come ... ?
Not really -
You have any other answers besides "not really"?
I known Kip longing than you, man ...
You think I don't know? You think I like to keep this inside? But I gotta, or he'll kill the miserable bastard and he'll be there for life. It's disgusting what you have to put up with.
Billy, how are you?
The guy from near where Christie used to live?
I know what you did inside. You did what you had to do. I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking from now on, outside. I'm talking right here.
Paulie. Why would I? I swear.
And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
It was easy money. I did it in the can.  Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie.
But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
Talk? To you? After what you did!
What bag?
I don't care. Something's going on.
I'm just having my last few drinks.
Stop! Stop!
Get packed.  We're getting out of here.
Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.
Then you're safer in here.
You know. The stuff I left.
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
What fucking good are these things? They don't fit. What do I need this for? I'm not paying for this shit.
How?
What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.
It's okay. I'll make it up.  I promise. Just hurry it up a little. Okay?
Paulie, I swear, I'm afraid. The guy's nuts. What do I have to do? Whatever I gotta do, I'll do.
All right, then.
What are we gonna do up there?
Jesus, that's really bad, did anyone even order a Flyin' Fish?
What'd you get? You get leniency?
I don't know what the fuck you're doin'. You're givin' us a ride.
What?
You don't know that.
You're kiddin' me.
Oh...
How you doin'?
What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that.
See, now this doesn't feel right.  When I made the decision to come over here it felt right. I had all these rationalizations... I just don't understand why Will never tells me anything, he won't let me get close to him, he tells me these weird lies--
All right Morgan, fine. I'll tell you why we're not going to "Kelly's." It's because the take-out bitch is a fuckin' idiot. I'm sorry you like her but she's dumb as a post and she has never got our order right, never once.
Come on, Will...
It's a good thing no one's Irish here.
Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo?
To tell you the truth, I wasn't there much. The class was rather elementary.
You're in a safe place, Will.
Down there.  And I'm nervous.
Alexander, I know your theory. The boy is updating, he's strategy stealing...
Well, if something was stolen, I should know about it.
Oh, I'm sorry.
What're you doing?
Yes. Under two conditions.
Of course.
That's fine, but did you ever think--
Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?
I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. So I sent my cheif negotiator.
I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
Excuse me, Timmy. Could you help us? We're trying to settle a bet.
How about Gerald Lambeau? Ever heard of him?
And he mailed it to Hardy--
You moved?
Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
I do.
He can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you.
--And why does he hang out with his friends? Because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to. It's called loyalty!
That's right! You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! So don't blame me for how your life turned out. It's not my fault.
I got one of those too.
Will, I can't believe you brought Skylar here when we're all wrecked. What's she gonna think about us?
Now you know Will, and I know, what you need to be doing. You have a gift.
What?
Well, I can see this is pointless...
Did you buy all these books retail, or do you send away for like a "shrink kit" that comes with all these volumes included?
Maybe you should be a patient and sit down.
How'd it go?
Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife?
They could see that I meant it.
Gerry says the meeting went well.
Not to me, they're not.
Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this?
That's right. And you fuckin' lost! And some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again!
Well, I'm here.  So, is that my problem? I'm afraid of being abandoned? That was easy.
It's not your fault.
I know.
Don't fuck with me.
I know.
I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...
Five minutes.
See, it's my life story. Five more minutes and I would have got to hear your best pick-up line.
I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description.
Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
Free?
Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another crack at it. Let me take you out.
Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?
When?
It's important that I learn this.
I guess so.
Will? Are you awake?
"Take-back?" What is that? I don't want a take-back. I want you to come to California with me.
Why not?
I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.
What am I scared of?
--Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry--
Yes, I do, Will.
Take care.
Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?--give the ol' place a last look?
Lots must a died, too.
Tom? You can come on. They gone.
Any gas?
Four.
I don't mean to be nosy, y'understand. I just got to have certain information. What's your name?
We'll work it out. What's this committee you talkin' about?
Why ain't they more like it?
Ma's shore gonna like it here. She ain't been treated decent for a long time.
But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.  I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.
No, I never. What?
I been in the penitentiary for four years. 
Maybe Ma'll have pork for supper. I ain't had pork but four times in four years--every Christmas.
What's the matter?
Fella named Spencer sent us--said they was work pickin' peaches.
Want to work, do you?
Sure do.
But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
Goin' far?
I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick or a sledge--that shines up your hands. I notice little things like that all the time.  Got a trade?
Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this.
You want to get ast to eat, hunh?
Ma. Pa.  Grampa, his eyes hurt and hunted and frightened and bewildered, scratches in the dirt.
No longer'n we can get acrost her.
Thought I'd take a walk. Any law against it?
Not tonight you can't. Want to walk back?--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?
I got to get a lot curiouser than I am--with all them cops out there.
You an' me's goin' together--jus' you an' me. We're a-goin' to that dance an' we're a-goin' to jus' set an' watch. If anybody says to come dance--why I'll say you're poorly. But you an' me, we're gonna hear the music an' see the fun.
How 'bout it?
You don't know *no* girls around here. You're lyin', *You're runnin' away*!
Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--
Glad to get shet of him. Never was no good an' never will be--
Sump'n got to happen soon. We got one day's more grease, two day's flour, an' ten potatoes. After that...  An' Rosasharn, we got to remember she's gonna be due soon.
No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.
An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
She shore don't look prosperous. Want to go somewheres else?
Tom--you tol' me--you promised you wasn't like that. You promised me.
Busted my cheek but I can still see. What'd you hear?
They know what--this fella looks like?
Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me.
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
Then it don't matter. Then I'll be all aroun' in the dark. I'll be ever'where--wherever you look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad--an' I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready. An' when our people eat the stuff they raise, an' live in the houses they build, why, I'll be there too.
You can have this for ten cents.
Then who *do* we shoot?
Brother, I don't know. If I did I'd tell you. But I just don't know *who's* to blame!
That's Connie Rivers with her. They're married now.  She's due about three-four months.
Can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him or he'll git so mad he'll hurt his self.  Reckon we could git him *drunk*?
Got that desert yet. Gotta take her tonight. Take her in the daytime fella says she'll cut your gizzard out.
Awright. An' if she gets outa han', I'll be in the right han' corner, this side the dance floor.
I sell biscuits to the Southland.
We had pictures put on, that way everybody knows who everybody was!
Wonderful.
Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
That's part of it.
Seven it is.
Are you there?
...Let me get my coat.
Not the other way around...?
...About five years now.
You kill people. 
I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.
Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be "withholding"... and I know where you live.
You know where I live?
You understand the psychology of the job.
I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.
Come on, live a little. I'm sorry about the incident yesterday.
Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. Some property. Some personal injury.
The more things change, the more they Goddamned well stay the same.
Looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us.
This?
All of it?
Good. What else? Anything interesting?
This is not good.
What's it look like?
That's wonderful, Mom.
So what happened to you?
Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
What the hell happened to you?
So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me.
Well, you know, however you want to put it -- I got your information from the publisher of the article. I called Montana and your sister-in-law, I think, gave me this number.  I'm been hot on your trail you could say because I was hoping you'd consider coming to New York and taking a look at my daughter's horse and possibly --
I, I don't mean to sound insensitive. I understand your situation. But there's nothing I can do. You just called the wrong person, that's all. I hear there are a bunch of therapists in New York. Maybe you should call one of them.
When I was first married.
I once heard Itzhak Perlman guest star with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He played Rachmaninov's Vocalize Opus 34. No. 14. It was one of the most beautiful pieces of music I ever heard. I actually forgot where I was for a time.  You seem surprised?
I've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat.
I found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts.
Need a lift?
The answer's no.
Poor thing.
Feel good?
Five years. My son was born here.
I hear that! See, I knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but I wanted to try -- I thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. My son would grow up here. Maybe have one or two more. I'd teach 'em what I could. They'd play with my brother's kids. All grow up together. And even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was -- cause we'd keep it for 'em...
You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out.
No, you didn't.
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
Mom?
Fine!
I didn't know I had to.
What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."
We'll have more room because we're moving onto the ranch. They have this empty house near this creek. It's actually pretty... OK... I love you.  Dad wants to talk to you.
Honey, come on. Would you like to stay in town for dinner? Maybe see what movie's playing tonight?
Look, I just wanted to say, I think it's great you're riding again. And... and I think I know why you, you needed to do it alone... without anyone knowing...
What?... Oh baby...
Who is it?
Did you speak to Farlow?
Uh, yes... Sure, David.
What about Grace?
I saw Judith's parents while you were at the apartment...  I wanted to say something...  But I... I was so relieved that Grace was still... that it wasn't our daughter.
You've got to stop doing that?
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.
I miss you, Annie.
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
May I have a suggestion?
What do you mean?
Was the trip okay?
Where to?
Oh, I don't know...
There's coffee inside... I was just bringing this to Tom.
She calls him Tommy...
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
Must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work, huh?
Sounds like something Tom would say.
I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.
Diane takes care of the books. I don't know how, but at the end of every month, everything adds up to the penny.
Can we take a look at Bronty's foal when we're done here, Dad?
Tom?
I wouldn't let happen.
Yeah?
She gonna be long?
She's an editor.
Isn't it like, obvious?
Can you drive?
I don't know if I can.
Where did you get Pilgrim from?
You want to go to a movie tonight?
I thought your mom's coming up?
"... and I said that"...
Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
What stuff is that?
About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders?
Yeah, cool.
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
Welcome to our show!
Hackers of the World, Unite!
Shit!
Hold on a second!
Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!
Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things.  What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on.
Oh wow, we are fried.
Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
The girl. The girl has the disc I need.
What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched.
Never heard of you. Done anything?
Seven. Wow! Burn's wetware matches her software!
Your slave?
Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
There they are!
Yeah.
Dade.
You know, I've been having these really weird..
Security, uh Norm, Norm speaking.
Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques.  Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem?
Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the principal's office.
Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool?  A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
Hello?
Die, dickweeds!
You guys always think I should know everything, and you never tell me anything. Am I right?
Yo, what's up?
Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.
Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!
Thank you.
I don't know Brady.
Its metal, god dammit its metal.
Brady!
When did this happen?
About what?
You know damn well about what.  You let them take it out of here.
We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner Hoffman! We are talking about evil on two legs.
Shit, Earl. It's Ted Holster.
Kido. It's four in the morning.
I can't sleep.
What is this? Four nights in a row?  You going for a record here?  The seven year olds insomniacs hall of fame?
It's been eleven months.
How about this afternoon I pick you up from school and we go get ice cream?
Come on Rachel.
Can we go home soon Rachel?
I'm gonna lower you to the chimney, okay Jamie?
Dad, what's going on?
Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
Hell of a night.
The state police won't know how to stop him.
Go to my house. We'll call the state force from there.
Isn't this all a little paranoid?
Now I pad locked the back door, this is the only way in and out of this house. You got that?
What is he? Tell me! What the hell are we dealing with?
Hi, Dad. What happened?
You blame everything on kids.
Look.
He was standing right here.
Sure, see you later.
I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
Wait a minute here...
Yeah.
Anybody live here?
I found the car! He's here!
Where?
What about the rest of my comic books?
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
What did he look like?
The bogyman!
Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs...
DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!
Hello.
Yes, she is.
Of course not.
PROBABLY going.
Ever done anything like this before?
What does that mean?
...any sister talk?
We need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  Hi.
Well, let's do it.
That's just --
Uh...
Gee, um...  I...I don't know what to say.
Oh, that was a wonderful show.  I think that's the best show you two ever wrote.
You're Holly.
We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried...
Oh, what, what do you do?
Yeah.
Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
So, so, but it was when I was younger, so--
You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
What I'd like to do, is to make an appointment for you at the hospital. I'd like to have them run some tests.
Child molestation is a touchy subject...
Yeah.
Oh, yes!  You live near here, don't you?
Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.
Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time.  I know you would.
Bye.
He's got like six gold records.
Oh, you-you have that one?
I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.
Not because of me, I hope.
Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
Why?
Poor Hannah.
I can't say anything!
Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
You've been very cold to me tonight.
Lee...
Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
But, you got four children!
Well, what?  What, wh-what are you not telling me?
Oh, Mom!
I don't understand.  I thought that you would be happy.
Elliot lusts after you.
No.
Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
Oh...
Oh, Jesus!
It was on your shirt!
Aah... Hey, have you tried Holly and her friend's shrimp puffs?
I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...
He's fine.
Oh, you know what?  I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.
I think so.
Gee.
Okay, stop being so dramatic.
Okay, okay.
Hannah, I have to borrow some more money.  Don't get upset.
Uh-huh.
You admit that we're great cooks, right?
Will you just tell me one thing?
Doesn't she look great in that new dress?
Frederick didn't come with her.
Watch out, you guys.  Beep-beep!
He's such a loser!
He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed.  You know what I'm saying? HANNAH  Oh, no, not at all.
Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you.
What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
Oh, God...
Well, I don't know.  We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting?
Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
You're grateful, but you resent me.
I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
Oh, why are you making those faces?
Mmm, I don't know if you remember me, but we had the worst night of my life together.
We didn't hit it off.
So how are you?
I'm okay.
Nobody ever said it.
Really?
No, I haven't.
I haven't.  No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--
I'm not anymore.  I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year.
You're okay, though, huh?
I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?
Sure.  Sure, uh, yes.
Now don't get nervous.  It's just your husband.
Thanks.
Hi.
Boy...Holly...Holly.
What makes you interested in becoming a Hare Krishna?
Yes?  My <u>promotion</u>...?
Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?
...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
He said, and these were his words, he <u>valued</u> our time together, because I was civil.
You want me to be?
Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?
No, you're wrong about Verger.
Evelda Drumgo.
You want to get married...?
Then you tell me, then.
...they're sending me.  Out to get Shot.  Hounding me.... they're... 
Brigham.  Go.  Affirmative.  Okay, Happiness is a Green Light.  We've got Evelda in the kitchen, cooking.  The dope's D.E.A.  <u>We</u> want her on Interstate Transportation of some firecrackers.  Starling:  you've got Drumgo, you know her from before.
Who, can you think, who would want to harm Dr. Fanelli, did he have any <u>enemies</u>, that...
...I have never met a man who was so well beloved.
Hold up a minute...
He escaped...
...they're from Baltimore....
Try Barney Clark.
....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
...here's to child abuse!
And I expect you to.  Let's talk like two medical men 
..suitcase...locker...
Look at this:
I think that's... {HE STARTS TO RISE, AND THE MEETING BEGINS TO BREAK UP) Starling, I'm sure these gentlemen...
What is that supposed to mean...?
She was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  And...
Evone tells me:  I shoulda been in, fi, six, months ago.... thizz my first checkup.
Sadly, no.  And I find that birth is one of the few things in life which study and a pleasant attitude can not amend. What do you think?
Could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
I never met him.  I knew him only from his writings.
You resemble a figure from the Della Robia Rondels, in your family's chapel at Santa Croce.
If such there breathe, I'm sure you could <u>unearth</u> him...  Your reputation does you honor. 
I'd like to walk home with you, and...
In and out.  Yes.  And Mama... and Mama, is not your real Mama, is she Franklin?
She's not the first foster that you've had.  <u>Is</u> she?
Yes.  Franklin, you can't live there anymore.  With Mama and Shirly and Kittykat.  You have to go away.
Make them eat the figurine.
...they eat the dummy, sir, they eat the <u>man</u>... I keep them hungry.  When... when do we think this man arrives.
Can you walk?  Are your legs working...?
...I'm sorry....?
...but will that satisfy you?
ARE YOU <u>DONE</u>?
What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
Yeah, well, it's a raw wound, innit, you're gonna bump it, every time you turn around... but you know what the <u>trick</u> is...?
My daddy would say:  accept with glee the things you cannot change.
I'll tell you what:  I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota. 
Why?
I know where he is.
An Honor.  Carlo Pazzi....
You were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.
Thank you.
....this is perhaps an inappropriate <u>time</u>... but, I would like to say, it is an honor to meet the Woman who <u>solved</u> the celebrated Hannibal Lechter...
It is <u>you</u> who have betrayed...
...no.
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
...you <u>are</u> an orphan.
And you have decided to accept... to accept this "emotion," as you put it, to the ... the "sweepings. of the Lechter case.
...yes...?
And all he <u>left</u> us:  the Country brought back his <u>hat</u>, and his <u>badge</u>... both with a bullethole in them.  An' that's what he left us.  That's what I said.
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived.  And because you have large resources.
Why are you being so grouchy--This is an important night for us...
Howdy Pouty.
She's still pissed at me and took it out on you. We should have taken it slower. It's hard to operate in the woods. Much easier in, like a club.  Tell the girl you've got to go do something, leave her view, take way too long until she is worried that you're not coming back. Just as she starts feeling awful, you come up from behind and touch her neck...
That really sucked, Eric, what you did, asking him that...
Oh thanks, it was nothing...
Whew, that wasn't a period. That was an exclamation mark. You know, Hayley, behind every great woman is a great first menstruation anecdote.
Thanks, Talia...Why are you so nice to me?
Hey, it's not a crush anymore if                            ] you actually say it to the person                           ] you supposedly have the...                                  ] ] JASPER                                             ] Thought I'd get points for a post-                          ] modern approach to coming on to you.                        ]
Goodnight, Jasper.
You and Wichita go to school together, right?  Have you two ever...
Am-ber!  Uh...don't do that.
Don't forget, when you get home, O.B.'s. They're created by a female gynecologist.
Who wants to go tell the Anti-christ to take a "time-out?"
I just never thought of you in that...
Yes you do.
I think your passion is terrific.
Do you really not believe in God?
And you'll be happy to know I'm going to drop my Snow White and the Seventy Dwarves act...Not all of it, but...
Gee, thanks.
Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
Hey really, I don't feel so great.
Oh, I have to hear this.
In my heart, Heather's still alive.
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I smoke these damn things?
Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......
What's your damage? Brad says you're being a real cooze.
You were nothing before you met me! You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout Cookie! I got you into a Remington Party! What's my thanks? It's on the hallway carpet. I get paid in puke!
Heather? Wha...
What are you doing here?!
Grow up, Heather. Bulimia's so '86.
What do you want from me?
Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?
No way, no day!
Veronica. What are you doing tonight?
Shit.
Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.
My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? "Bringing every State to a Higher State."
Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.
I know exactly what the hell you're talking about and you're right, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Let's just grow up, be adults, and die.
No shit, sherlock. I can't believe it. I just killed my best friend.
What are we going to tell the cops? "Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge."
That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school.
So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!
Oh.
Perrier water!
This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.
You believed it because you wanted to believe it. Your true feelings were too gross and icky for you to face.
I did not want them <u>dead</u>.
You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience.
She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
It's over, J.D.  Over!
Let's kick his ass.
You going to eat this?
You two....
How was the funeral?
Everybody cares for youth but nobody cares about Joey Blow. When that news reporter gets home he'll scream at his son for not mowing the lawn in the right pattern.
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?
and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.
I'd better be getting back. Bye, love.
Well, I guess I take after you then!
She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
You have to let me go!
I felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. Life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out.
looks startled at the outburst.
This.
What??
Let's go overseas . . .
This lot's got to be worth 50 quid!
I can try my father's safe. I'm sure I can get the keys to his office.
Mummy!
Let's go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night.
No I need to remember. Look whatever it is take me off it. I can handle pain. I can't handle not knowing...
Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
I understand, I think. Other women?
Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.
No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
Allison I think I did some very, very bad things. I mean very bad.
Really? Do tell.
We were gonna be millionaires you said. Nobody'd suspect a thing. I had never even met her. No connection. Then you went and had that fucking car accident.
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
Why don't you relax for the next couple of hours? Barring any relapses you should be able to go home after that.
You could say that.
Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now Kirsty?
Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.
OH MY GOD TREVOR! It hurts!!  oh my God, Oh my God. Trevor, It's coming out.
Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has your head healed okay by now?
For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally.
Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. But this wasn't murder it was an accident-
Okay how many fingers am I holding up?
Two.
What things do you think you've done?
All you've got is the here and the now Trevor. That's all anyone really has. Maybe this will make things easier to understand. A man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man. And at the end of the day does it even matter? All these events you're describing. How can you be sure any of them really happened?
Trevor your body has been completely healed. All the nerve endings have repaired themselves. If there is any pain in your head it's... in your head.
Are you ready?
Wait... what the hell is this...
It's not that kind of date.
Tawny I think I'm going to be sick.
Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?
Sell it to him.  You get a couple bucks, it pays for the ride.  I got a job, nice apartment.  I do okay.
LaPlante!
Bernie.  Call me Bernie.
Listen, John, you better double my attorney's fee.  She's very inexperienced, but she done a great job for me. And give her your autograph.  She thinks you're some kinda holy man.
I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.
There was this kid there saying, "Go in there and save my father, mister." And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself.
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
I seen on the TV where that do-gooder asshole's gonna go visit sick kids at three-thirty.  Children's Hospital, on the double.
My attorney, she's just outta law school, about a couple of years older than my kid, for Chrissake.
Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
DON'T SAY "BILL," BERNIE!  DON'T SAY ONE WORD!  DIDN'T I SAY "ONE WORD AND YOU'RE FIRED?"
YOU KNOW WHY?  BECAUSE IT'LL BE AN <u>EXCUSE</u>!  IT'LL BE "BERNIE LAPLANTE EXCUSE NUMBER FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SIX."  NO, FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE.  THAT'S HOW MANY EXCUSES YOU HAVE GIVEN ME, I KEEP TRACK OF THEM ELECTRONICALLY. I HEARD THEM ALL, BERNIE.
For God's sake, tell him I'm on my way.  Let's go, Chucky.  A police escort is gonna pick us up en route.  You too, LaPlante.
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
Are you gonna take me somewhere next weekend?
I... I know that, John...
I know the truth, John.  I'm flying in some guys from your unit in Vietnam tomorrow.  Interviewing them live on network hookup!
Gale...
The...Silver...Mike...Award!
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
Swiped your purse!  While he was saving you?  You gotta be kidding!
Unprofessional.
You just can't bear the idea of good news.
Not bad.  But if you gotta wear a cast, you oughtta feature it more it's parta the story.  Network's taking everything we give 'em.  They wanta feed off our six o'clock whether we find the mystery guy or not.  We're very big nationally.
What?
Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.
Never reach out!
Shouldn't we have buzzed him to let him know --
Is he like that in real life?  So gorgeous?
Excuse me, Ms. Gayley.  That guy Inspector Dayton... he's recovered a bunch of your credit cards and he wants...
You better believe it, buddy. Your average Rolls Royce doesn't have to pass as many tests.  You want consistency?  You want dependability?  You want safety?
How are they with kids?
Okay.
Well, it's for a woman.
Yeah, since I was a kid.  I had a woodwork class once when I was... in school that time.  Then I learned a lot more when I was in the --
I am.  I'm really feeling pretty good.  I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.
No, no, no, no.
Things are beginning to come to a head.  I can feel it.  And I want everything to be perfect.
There's so much I want to say to her, it's all jumbled up in my mind, and I don't want her to misunderstand --
Oh, great.
Listen, I'm sorry, but it's really late -- you don't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor.
Hey.  Have a nice time -- it's a good school.
I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation.
Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?
Neil, calm down.
I thought we'd be happy here.
I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
Honey -- I can't find those large- size Hefty trash bags!
Honey, it's not the end of the world.  You'll call Lowenthal tomorrow and find out it was just a mix-up.  And if he's not interested anymore, then you'll find another company to go to maybe even your own.  You are free now, you are independent.
That's not the case.
I was having a bad day -- I lost that job, I was dependent on other people, I was let down --
What?
Just reduced.
This is a terrific entrance hall, What a welcoming feeling.
Okay!  We have TV!  We can all get stupid again!
All right then, if I have to go to school then I'd better go.
Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
Y'know what?  I'm ready to cancel our trip.  I really am. I've had it.
Do you see a man?
No.
Where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...?
Lieutenant?
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.
Hey Lieutenant, the boys in robbery have something I think you should look at.
This ties in with Nash.
You don't understand.  About seven years ago we found the body of a guy named Vasilnic in Jersey.  A week later in the parking lot of Madison Square Garden we found Iman Fasil. Three days after that Luman Castageer was found in an alley.  The fourth body we've never been able to identify.  All four men died from decapitation.  Nash was our primary suspect -- but he disappeared.
A few days ago.
Tell me again.  Where'd you go?
Around.
Since we hardly know each other, I'm sure you'll understand if I hold one to it for awhile.
Sing.
The river.
England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
If it came down to it what would you do?
What are we doing here?
You've been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past?
No.  What am I to do?
No -- I will.
It will be a good harvest this year.
Aye?
Why not?
Aye.
What do you want?
Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
I'll be fine.
You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.
Yes.
--the Calan.  Do you know who they are?
Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  They were wedged in tight.  They couldn't get a grip on them.  They would have had much more strength pushing on them.
You wanted the truth -- now you have it.
Must you fight him?
Be careful, Conner.
We found him this morning.
I know.
I love you, Conner.
I'll no forget you.
I could have ended it tonight, but I didn't.
Why?
I think he's dead!
Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.
What'd you find out?
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
Yes, sir.  But what about the disks?  If the cops end up with the disks, we're gonna see a whole lot of heat.
What, he's cute?  That's his idea of humor?
Everyone knows what we look like, Dennis. We won't be able to hide.
If we don't escape, we gotta get the word out about the cash.  That's how we'll stay alive.
How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you?
Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.
That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter.
Now I understand.  That helps.  I can make them understand that.
Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
Use more ice.
That's right.  That's a good idea, Mars.
I like it here, Dennis.  I'm never going to leave.
I don't know.
Are you out of your mind?
Give me an ETA.
What hospital?
I have your fucking family.  Don't forget that.
I need to work out some stuff.
Can we talk some more when you get here?
Ow!  Shit!
Dennis and Mars are in the den.  I'll get your brother, then come back for you. We'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand?
He said something about a girl --
What's going on?
Where are they?
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
He didn't say.
I pulled Mickey and Dreyer off the minimart.
She didn't answer.
Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the cars.
If we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in.
Excuse me?  <u>You</u> requested our help.  You turned over command --
I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --
It's mine.  Talley.
What?
I asked you my name.  You just saw my commission slip.  What's my fucking name?
The kids are in here!
We're okay.
I thought they locked you in your room.
Are the disks still in your room?
Who are you?
Don't just fuckin' sit there, dumbass. Do you understand?
What do you want?
What happened?
That's what I came to talk to you about.
I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu.
How many in your family?
No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.
Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
Hold the line here. Do not shoot! The Colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive by. Paul approaches Oliver
What's happening?
Anything. Strong.
Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved us all.
They fired a rocket at us.
Will you protect us.
What is it?
Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.
What did you overhear?
The high command? Our high command?
The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.
I am going to do you a great favor.  I am going to take you with us to Gitarama.
The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list.
You have no whiskey?
For fuck's sake, Gloria There's a big news story out there! We need to get out and cover it.
Lets go, Jock.
Good. I'd like to book a massage.
This is a Rolex, I can't take it.
No.
The president has been murdered.
To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
You cannot go alone.
Why?
What sort of car?
What sort of plan?
Can I have your name again?
Why?
What is it like to fly on a plane, sir?
Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?
What do we do with all these people?
Moses, Moses Seradungu.
Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
-- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger.
But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
If you don't mind me asking... Who are you?
Jesus H. Christ!
Don't think it'll be a problem.
What are you playing here, Price?
You're totally full of shit, aren't you?
-- the stained glass --
Is she...alright?
Why not?
The opening's still too small, we'll never get through!
I knew this whole place'd be pure gold! Pritchett, point me in the direction of the goddamn ghosts! If I can get something bizarre enough on tape, I think I can parlay it into getting me some kind'a Robert Stack "Unsolved Most- Wacked-Out Home Videos" gig. No more five afternoons a week of sex-change- Nazis-and-the-lesbos-that-love-'em.
...birds. Just seagulls or something walking on the glass, goddammit.
So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that?
Melissa Margaret Marr, Celebrity.
-- forget it. Last birthday the Manson Family Ranch, the year before that: Jonestown.
Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.
Then who are they?
So how's a girl to know if these things are loaded, baby?
I was in the middle of --
No, no, it's just --
Your roller coaster that is, quote: "unlike any that has ever come before it."
-- my loss --
House 2, Guests 0.
He was right! Pritchett was right!
Jennifer-Jenzen-Executive-V.P.- Paragon-Pictures.
I was upstairs!
Please! I need your help.
I mean, not that it didn't give Evelyn the kind of coronary I had in mind, just...
But the million bucks each, that's for real?
There is something very not normal going on here!
Blackburn's dead.
Price!
What was her name?
We don't have proof of that.
How did you meet Dr. Shea?
There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university.  I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.
I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.
I'm sorry.
By killing them?
I don't understand.
Are we leaving mommy?
Did you grow up in Ireland mister?
Are we going back to California daddy?
I wish I knew more about her.
There's got to be an explanation. It could be a magnetic flux or something, maybe the power lines are giving off something.  Who knows?  I don't know, I think it's kind of interesting.
We'll destroy you...destroy all of you!
Maura!
I think we should do it.
She attended the church for years. A dear woman, it was sad to see her decline so rapidly.
Why?
Yes it is. Will and Seamus look at each other -
What's going to happen?
There's something through that wall!
I know what I saw.
OK.  Be careful.  And lighten up.  Story of your life could be right round the corner.
It's ... I don't know.  First World War, right?
Hold on.  Hold on, please.  I need talk to you.
Look, lady!  I told you!  It's not my problem!  I was just there!
That's great.
I'll boil some water.
Cool.  I read a book once.  It was like all these people discovering who they used to be.  You know, like reincarnation?  It was really good.  You ever read that?
Maybe not.  But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?
What else came with it?  Anything still here?
Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else.  Get dressed.  Get out.
I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
JP?
Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?
Hey, it has been known.  C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy.  I have regrets. I'd like to put things right.  Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Huh?
Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over?  You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.  Just see how we both feel?
Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.
You're saying you want us to beat them to the crystal and save the world from financial disarray.
Why try?
Let's just forget it, I mean...
My life is not some deal.  I...
Lucky for us, the Da Vinci is located in a wing of the Kremlin that they used to throw the Miss Ukraine pageant and stuff.  It'll have the least number of guards....
I'm going to find out.
My God, that was bold of you, you didn't have to do that...
Tough guy.  What are you--How's your head.
Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times Square?
This doesn't taste like cappuccino.
You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex.... the Mayflower Museum.
Selfish attitude?  I'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much foam...
I hope you know what....
Have I ever told you the world is beautiful...  I'd really like to play Nintendo with you, or something...
Bunny, not you too?
Don't I know you...
I Want to make things up to you. That's why I got you this gig, doll.  Hawk, my name's George Kaplan and to quote the late, great Karen Carpenter, "We've only just begun."
Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.
Employer?  The president?
I'm supposed to fall for that?
Something short.
Sharp.
Nobody told me! Nobody told me! You sold all of our stock?
An' only some kind a knucklehead thinks she knows things 'bout things she, uh -- when she don't, uh -- How'd that go?
Cigarette?
Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?
I'm sure I --
Confused?
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
...I'm sorry.
Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
Now, Aim --
Sez who?
...On payday! The only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you, Al.
Archer, you're a broken record. Fact is Gunderson did design it -- apparently he's some kind of prodigy --
Whatever! It's no dig on you, Archer, but this story is hot and you're no longer on top of it. Why, it's the scoop of the century -- the other papers won't have the Gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- The Allemeinischer Zeitung, Le Figaro, they'll be choking on our dust come mornin' --
You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!
I'm sure you do.
...What's your pleasure, buddy?
And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here --
But, buddy, you were --
I understand if ya don't like the Buzz-Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, I'm prayin' to ya!
...Yeah, go ahead.
...'Shnook'? 'Dope'? 'Dipstick'? 'Lamebrain'?
Relax, Norville. It's only natural in a period of transition for the more nervous element to run for cover.
Finally.
...Congratulations, kid, you've really outdone yourself. Reinvented the wheel. I'm going to recommend to the Board that we proceed immediately with this, uh... with the, uh... that the dingus be mass-produced with all deliberate speed. Of course, as president of the company the ultimate decision is yours.
Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I --
...and awduhs a light lunch.
Hello, Niagara.
I know, miss.  But I like to do it. I like to tend for Miss Jessica and I want to tend for you.  You settle right back, now, and I'll mix you your coffee.
At the Houmfort.
Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?
I think you need some help.
I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
Haven't I?  I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here.
Mrs. Rand...
You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
Miss Connell's testimony will be very important.
And that chair --  is the particular property of Mrs. Rand -- mother to both of us and much too good for either of us. Too wise, in fact, to live under the same roof. She prefers the village dispensary.
Where do you think you're going?
I wish I hadn't heard --
That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.
I made it clear in my letter to the company.  This is not a position for a frightened girl.
I'm sorry...
Mrs. Holland must have been beautiful ---
I suppose so.  Yes.
I've never given it much thought.
I heard about your little misadventure yesterday, Miss Connell.  On your first "day off," too.
Well, I had a good time up to a point.
Wesley can be very entertaining.
I heard you playing.
What you saw tonight -- two brothers at each other's throat and a woman driven mad by her own husband?  Do you love that?
Help me? How?
You have deliberately endangered Mrs. Holland's life.  There's no telling what you may have started with this insanity.  Why did you do it?
I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.
I remember words I said to Jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her, to madden her.
That's past -- that's over and done with...
I tell you he hasn't and he wouldn't dare use it if he had.
Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist?
I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?
Then again, why should she be? I mean with us, with our...
Good night.
I... I think I am...
Whatever that means Elena -- And you complain about me not communicating... I thought it was --
You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do something here? Is that it? Is it something I did?
I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.
Dinner in ten minutes.
So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
What's for dessert?
Don't start.
It's a starting place.
Ready to go?
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?
Yeah. Well, we can just --
I'm fine dad.
Grades?
Yeah.
Holy! Well. If you're worried about anything, just feel free to ask, and, uh, we can look it up.
Huh?
How you take it isn't all that interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm sorry --
Fascist!
Good-night dad.
Your toes cold?
-- What advice? You never --
-- 73
It's not the taxes I object to. It's all the fines and penalties.
Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.
A key party?
Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --
Sure. Maybe coffee.
I suppose. Why?
Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt.
Please don't.
I used to know how to cook.
I'm thinking of going back to school.
Educated guess.
I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- I've never been much of a joiner, although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person --
In many ways, the church-bound tradition of the father, son, and holy ghost is simply a version of the parent-child-adult triad within us all. It's a primitive set of symbols for our inner psychology.
Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?
I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
Shit. You're not planning --
Jesus, Jim!
No!
The Idiot?
Great, thanks for the tip.
Maybe you should have just a half.
Yeah but you don't even know me really.
Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets.
That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
Maybe we can just watch some TV.
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
Charles, what time is it?
Well, you can...
Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p.o.'d.
They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up.
Huh?
Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality.
But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
Who's that?
I know.
I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something.
What I saw?
She left the party early.  Friends said she had a fight with her boyfriend and stormed out.
Good.
Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house.  It's signed.  Personally.
You don't have to be involved, Will.
What is it?
One of your cases?
You heard me that time.
I don't know what you're fucking talking about.
After that she left the party to go to him.
What was?
I said you're going to get a phone call.
Yes.
Don't you pull that shit with me.
Monstrous.
Disappointing, isn't it? To come so far and find so little. Jaded ingenues, amusing themselves with make- believe...
Louis, they cannot be brought back. There are some things that are impossible, even for me.
More.
I want some more.
I didn't realise.
You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them?
How did you learn to write, Claudia?
He jests.
Claudia - don't -
You... fed on me?
He's dead, Claudia, dead.
Louis, look at me.
And you never cried -
How do I look?
Mortals, mortals everywhere. And lots of drops to drink.
Never.
Yes...
What do you mean?
You're not afraid of anything, are you?
Diane!!!!
They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy...
Give it to me!!!
I can't go through with it, I tell you.
I learnt absolutely nothing. I wasn't give a choice, remember?
Evil is a point of view. God kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves.
Claudia, Claudia, will you never learn? Who will we get now to finish your dress? A little practicality, cherie...
You'll come home with me Louis? Fro a little while... until I am myself again.
I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!
I tried to tell you Louis... that night in Paris... when I first came to you... no-one can refuse the dark gift, Louis... not even you.
That's what I do. I interview people. I collect lives. F.M. radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who -
You believe this, don't you? That you're a vampire? You really think...
We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
But I thought vampires didn't like the light.
How did you do that?
Yes.
Can a vampire feel love?
Did he die in the fire?
Dear God. I've failed again, haven't I?
Is that bad?
What the hell would you call this?
Stupid. Stupid.
I don't know, man. Maybe we should keep going, find a phone --
No.
Julie, you left four messages... Four.
Karaoke -- perfect.
Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see?
Karla!
Julie...
I got in early. I was excited...  Who was that guy?
Ray, I can't...
Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it.
Ray...what are you doing?
I'm fine.
No, no, no. This was really sweet...
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
Maybe we should just wait here? Hide in a tree?
Come on, it'll be fun.
Rio de Janeiro!
Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
How much?
He leave you?
Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
Can't talk right now.
There's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us.
You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
They were cut loose.
What is up with that weirdo?
I'd like to, very much -- but it depends on what dispatches are waiting for me on the mainland.
He won't even know you're there. He is delirious.
We will see who is the first to die.
I'm here. The General is here. You are not alone.
I have not been on the island in twenty years. It is changed - changed completely. Where are the graves -- the coffins?
If Mr. Albrecht is right, we'll all be free in a few days.  I suppose you'll be going on to Athens?
Thea -- you're hiding something. Why do you suddenly speak of your father? You told me once you had never seen him -- didn't know him --
I felt he did not like me.
They were talking about the Vrykolakas this morning. Cathy, that's what you are  a weak, pale, half-dead thing that drains all the life and joy from those who want to live.
What would I be thinking?
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live - I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
I don't really know where Thea comes from. The ViceConsul at Adrianople brought her to me..
Her family name?
You do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came?
There's no one there - nothing but the caves and the dead.
Oh, now  now look here 
I can't understand that.
Please.. You shouldn't laugh --
Thea, what's wrong?
Because she loved him.  I know him, Thea. Believe me, he is not a cruel man.
Then foreclose!
Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you?
That's what I was sent down for. I'm your guardian angel.
What'd you say?
It isn't me!
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
What?
I . . .
She's . . .
Well, naturally. Of course.
Why, yes. This is amazing.
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
I know. I know.
Look, Daddy . . . paste it.
I'm not sleepy. I want to look at my flower.
Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, Sam.
Big  see! I don't want one for one night. I want something for a thousand and one nights, with plenty of room for labels from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand . . . a great big one.
Oh  Welch. That's what I get for praying.
Came back three days ago.
Hmmmm . . .
Nice girl, Mary.
No.
Oh, George!
Mr. Gower, do you want something . . . Anything?
Anything I can do back here?
Yes, sir. They have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir?
I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
I know it's soon to talk about it.
Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.
Do me a favor, will you, George?
Hey, George . . .
Nothing.
Let's go out in the fields and take off our shoes and walk through the grass.
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
All of it?
Every cent of it, and it still was less than we owe.
And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors. I . . . I . . . I . . .
Now look, did you buy anything?
Pop!
Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in  providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.
With coconuts?
Uh-huh.
Your . . . your caboose, my lady.
What'd you wish, George?
Didn't you tell her?
Do you like it?
No, I don't want to be rude.
Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.
Pop, can I have the car? I'm going to take over a lot of plates and things.
When do we get to the lighthouse?
I can't wait to get there.
Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p.m.
What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?
It's okay, it's okay....
Why not?
Your dad must be really pissed.
But the island!
You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess.
I can't let you take her out.
You're too close.  Back off.
Don't go out if it's rough or any- thing, huh?  We've had a lot of trouble.
Pop....
Sean's still out there.
Probably.
It's either a Great White, or another killer whale.
Late.
Why?
Listen -- what are you doing later?
You have to smoke so early in the morning?
Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat   He's another one.
Boat nut.  What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating?
No.
Do you?
Are you going to be able to sleep?
What?
That you were fired.
Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.
Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it.  Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture...He's out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me....
Turn in the car.  Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss.
What is it?  What's the matter?
A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
Bullshit?  I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
10-4,   soon as I can raise him.
Did you say Cable Junction?
The lighthouse is a make-out spot.
Now I really want to see it.
Ready?
Me neither.
All of them.  Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all that whole gang.
Mrs. Brody, look -- if he can't go, then you can't go.  Neither of you can go.
No way.  Everybody's going sailing. If you don't want to take me, just say so.
Who wouldn't.
I don't need you.  Andy's here.
I think we got a couple of live ones.
So?  So?
It hasn't adjusted.
It would make a marvelous attraction;  the only Great White in captivity.
With those camera lights and...
You see the three-quarter socket?
What is it, 97 days?
That macho pompous English --
Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.
Where's the rubber band?
No.
Michael, the sub's dead.
Are you coming...?
I think so.  I'm not sure... Are you?
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
You amaze me.  I'm more scared than you.
Recovering nicely.
I need more pressure in the shark tank.
... Mean through the tubes?
It's too soon to move him.
I have to get out of here.
Yes, you can.
What did you just say before? About water flowing through them?
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
That's right.
It's one of the world's greatest creatures.
You look like an orange worm.
We're taking that shark alive!
Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.
Believe me, I am.
Sharks have to keep moving.  They can never stop or they'll suffocate. If water isn't always flowing through them, they'll die.
I knew it;  it's my fault.  We moved it too soon.
Sure.  No problem.
Herpes?
Watch it, I'm gonna fall.  I'm gonna go!
What?
Hey, I don't want to hear.
Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
Reach for the limit I always say.
I'll go with you.
She still talking to you?
It has its virtues.  It hasn't fallen down yet....
Come on, sweetheart....
But you always let me....
Only children are my favorites. That means you, MaGee....
No way....
We need beer....
It doesn't take much to remember what day they come....
Off....
What's wrong?  What happened?
Sweetheart....
I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....
Get the bang sticks.  We're going down.
We have to dig it deep so the water will go all the way around...So we can swim to it....
I will.  I'll miss you, Grandma.
It came for him.  It waited all this time and it came for him....
Okay.
I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
I m not unhappy.  Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little.  It'll work out....
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.
I'm not saying you're wrong, just that there are other possibilities....
I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....
There's nothing to be sorry about.
Can you keep a secret?  Something no one else knows?
What say we get the hell out of here, Ellen Brody. ...
Keep it steady....
Jake tells me you're going to have to fly for the rest of your life to pay off what you lost at the crap table....
What do you deliver on all those charters you...?
I'll get her.  Have a good Christmas, Matt....
You tagging them...?
If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak....
Sharp shirt, Jake....
Money is money....
He's just trying to keep you from disappearing up your own....
We don't write up anything until we're done....
We got it together, Jake....
What?
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....
You getting a reading on them?
Holy Christ....
Wait for the sucker to charge, then hit the switch.  Just like taking a picture.
Your equipment has crapped out again....
No way....
How much longer?  This is supposed to be your party.
That bad, huh?
You have the safety talk at school, one o'clock tomorrow....
Gone to Ben Masters' place.  Cow tipping.
I'll take care of it.
The <u>dogs</u>?
There's nothing in the files?
Someone bet me a dollar ..
This looks promising .. I think this one could be it?
Thank Christ we got a witness.
Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right .. I knew there was some- thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. We gotta get back up that dump ..
We're going.
You looked like you did?
Yeah .. I guess she's in the kit- chen .. We got a so-called prof- essional cook out there having a nervous breakdown over a turkey ..
Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops?
Listen, you don't havta come?
What is that?
Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
I never asked if he could "see." I just asked one or two of the stud- ents if they remembered anything?
Alright, you got it. And I'll be putting an Observer in with you.
Kid told me he didn't take it?
Hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert.
You must have some idea about him.
No. Except he smoked. Like you.
Did Amber have a dog?
Yes.
I'm sorry, someone slammed the door on me. I couldn't get out.
Are you wearing a uniform?
No.
I know what you're like ..
He said that? What else did he say?
Which is what?
I know.
I think they're gonna arrest me.
What are you doing, Travis?
Alright, guys. We stop this <u>now</u>.
And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket.  Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?
I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.
Okay, this is working.
Listen to me!
Didn't hear it.
Oh Jerry.
Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
Well, take care.
Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
So I know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right?
Honey -- later, okay?  Whoop.  Wait.
It's all going to work.
Sorry.  Uh, let me see, have a seat. I'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too.
No, I do.  I feel like Clarence Thomas.  I'm like... harrassing you... right now.
Happy. He said "happy?"
Oh good.
Oh God.
Another time, okay Dorothy?
And I really don't know your noises yet.
It's my fault.
Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick.
He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.
Good.
Oh, thank you.
What happened to Denver?
--  now to recap, I want to stay in Arizona, I want my new contract, I like you, you're nice to my wife, I will stay with you, that's what I'm doing for you, but here's what you're gonna do for me. You listening?
No.
You are not allowed to act this way.
Another drink please.
I'll get you some quick work --
But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
I'm a little worried --
Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
No, I'm going to answer you.  You want an answer?  I'll give it to you.  Loyalty.  She was loyal.  Everything grew from there.
Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --
Thanks for coming.
Marcee.  How's my favorite player's wife?
How can I make your life better?
You gonna get that --
Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
Let's go the zoo.
He's gonna have nothing left for next season.  They're letting him kill himself.
We can't just...
How much weight have you lost?
Young adult.
We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.
This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.
Is it a rex?
I don't remember that on InGen's list.
ALAN!
Yeah.
Why?
We climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean. With any luck, the Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.
Do you have any kids?
No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we can from the plane. Then we head for the coast. There may be a boat left, something to get us off this island.
There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?
Amanda!
Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy. They won't do a God Damn thing.
How did you know?
You hear something?
It doesn't matter what I think.
What?
John . . .
What kind of gun is that?
You rally think this'll draw the parent?
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
The radio rig is inside.  It runs directly from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn't be a problem.
It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen never--
Do you see any family resemblance here?
What do they want?!
Why did you come here?
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
What?
So what's your story, Nick?
Uh - - Mr. Hammond - -
That storm center hasn't dissipated or changed course. We're going to have to cut the tour short, I'm afraid. Pick it up again tomorrow where we left off.
Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?
Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?
I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
Oh, I'll get 'em all.
These are dilated.  Take a look.
There's only one way to be positive.  I need to see some droppings.  I have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
Once we have control again we - -
Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.
They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.
Oh, shit.
It's just the two raptors, right?  You're sure the third one's contained?
Do you see anything?
Oh, imperfections?
Alan?
Can we chance moving him?
Seven days?!  Seven days?!  Oh, great.  Oh good - - clever.
You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.
That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?
You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
The kids okay?
Blood temperature feels like high eighties.
You four are going to have a little company out in the park.  Spend a little time with our target audience. Maybe they'll help you get the spirit of this place.
Go  that's the way we're going to go.  What do you say?
Hear that?  Are you hearing this?
Tim, Tim, Tim....
It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, Tim.  One, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?
John doesn't subscribe to Chaos, particularly what it has to say about his little science project!
You don't give us our due credit.  Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before.
Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.  Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them.  Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!
I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....
I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals.  And these are herbivores.
You tell them if they come up to seventy-five, I'll cut them in on the Crystal Lake package.
You want to put in chain saws?
I don't think the people who live around here would like that very much...
That's not true...
Beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches...  We can do some great logging up here.
Structure might be salvageable... let's see what the interior looks like.
I really think we should go back...
What happened?
Sorry.
Oh?
Nurses. That's why I went into medicine.
Not much here. Jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia... that's about it.
So Jason doesn't sleep... how does that help us?
Not guilty by reason of insanity. Case closed.
Me too. I'm drunk.
What's that?
Ten CC's of this shit and you won't be dreaming about anything.
We're down to seven minutes.
Are you all right?
It's only majestic from here. When you get closer you see it for what it really is.
Heralds of a new age -- does that sound immodest?
Preliminary investigations may already be underway.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
But <u>I'm</u> the messenger.  An error like this damages my credibility.
To do my work well, I have little time for --
It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
I know.
No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.
Tonight?
I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.
The day he died, Eduard was called up to the Castle.  Did you know that?
You might think -- I thought so myself at first -- that Burgel's too insignificant to be dangerous. But that's the very reason to beware! It's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character.
Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
Your office is the Workmen's --
I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
That's not what I call conclusive evidence of an abduction.
Still, we're probably closer to you at the moment than any of your fellow human beings.
-- If an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident -- and should he tragically die in spite of the District Medical Officer's strenuous efforts to save him -- the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible ... efficiency.
And I suppose Dr. Murnau didn't die in a cave-in.  You killed him to free the Position of Orlac Medical Officer for your own ends.
What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?
Why would we keep files on <u>dead</u> employees?  All old files are sent up to the Castle.  Do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records?
It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
A Neolithic bronze ... Reminiscent of the Nias Island cultures ... It ' s very curious. Defiantly Pagan. The use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... What do you think?
Oh God, it's that bloody yank!
How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
God, you're so obnoxious! Our work happens to be of great anthropological value!
It's ok.I know what you were feeling.
Jack! This is the archeological find of the century!
Man Eater!!!
Denham! Go back to the wall ... Tell'em to give me twelve hours to get back with Ann!
Did you fear for your life?
Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns?
It's good to see you. Well -- could we do it first and then just talk?
Yes?
And Cannes was quite fun, quite; and we played baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little Italian marquis quite enthusiastic for me -- but a young man can be so silly --
Oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it?
Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide.
What was better? I made better bait?
Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't --
Yes.
What is it?
My name's John Klute.
Company outing or picnic or something like that.
You've changed your mind? You do want to play?
Do you know where he got the dumper?
Did you like my friend Frankie?
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
Yeah, you got to me.
Not much point to this, is there?
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
You could help me find her. You know the people.  I'll pay you a hundred dollars.
What the hell do you think's the matter.  I could wait for you someplace.
The same as Jane McKenna.
The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time.
My God, I thought it was over. And here I am, daddy, right back at the start.
Bree --
Go down in my room.
You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side?
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
No. No mistake Pete. It doesn't prove who it was -- but proves it wasn't Tom.
You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.
Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
Just send me a money order.
I wanted to give it to you first.
They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
She told me.
But if Cable killed Grunemann why would he get you hired to look for Grunemann?
But what reason could he have? What possible reason?
Nobody's seen that.
Are you closing the case?
Where is the child?
Does that distress you?
What does?
Oh, sure.  Here, this can be mommy.
Lunch in a restaurant.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Huh?...Oh God...What time is it?
You forgot the milk.
You're late.
It's just...I've been catching a lot of flack at the office...
Salisbury steak.
All it is is onions and gravy.
I think I'm going to throw up.
No.
Objection.
Mom--I mean, dad?
Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?"
Daddy, what if The Face comes when I'm at mommy's?
Does the witness deny the injury took place?
No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning.
And would you describe those years as happy?
Because my son is here.  And his father is here.  As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father.
Objection.
No further questions.  Thank you Mrs. Phillips.
And how did you find his work?
Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and--
No.
A heavy drinker?
No.
I'm not taking him with me.
Ted, I can't...I tried...I really tried but...I just can't hack it anymore...
C'mon, Joanna, you don't mean that.  You're a terrific mother--
How's the new job?
Yeah, well he did, didn't he.
Ted, when we got married it was because I was twenty-seven years old and I thought I should get married and...when I had Billy it was because I thought I should have a baby...and I guess all I did was mess up my life and your life and--
Joanna, what the hell is--
What the hell is this?
Murray had some ideas about the Fire and Ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs...  I think they're kind of interesting.
Okay, Phyllis, what's up?
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
No, but--
Ted, Joanna and I used to talk a lot and...well, she told me a lot of...ah, things about the two of you.
Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I know, I went through it. You've got to believe I did everything I could to get Joanna to stay.  But I'll tell you something. You may not want to hear it, but it took a lot of courage for Joanna to do what she just did.
Lenox Hill.  77th Street between Park and Lex.  The emergency number is 327-0800.
No.  I don't think so.
Not for a couple of months. The last time I heard from her she was living in San Francisco.
California?
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear you say that!
I will buy them for you.
Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized.
Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.
Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?
The Sera monks have surrendered?
Ngabo did not have the state seal. He could not sign.
Holiness?
I accept it. What is suffering?
Will we be in this war?
He warned about the future of Tibet.
The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.
I am scared.
The pursuit of non-violence. Very difficult.
Do you think I must?
She carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. She opened her basket and showed what she had. Heads. Human heads. Only the heads.
This is Britain.
You will not come?
We cannot.
This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet.
Much too young.
He just <u>appeared</u>.  You have no idea how he arrived in this lake?
And how would you have accomplished this, Ma'am?
Murders and rapes in the cities. People bomb planes... can the police stop them?  <u>No</u>.  But feed one little cow to a crocodile...
<u>Please</u>.  I'll have sex with you, anything, but get out of the water.
Cocktail?
What are <u>you</u> doing?!
I'm laying a spring trap!
I coulda shot you, you--
Just spit him back out.  Some shall live, some shall die, arbitrarily, sound like any higher power we know?
You ready on shore?
I got something on the screen.
Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
Thank you, Jack.
Hector.  The big one has no sense of humor.  And since <u>he's</u> the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self.
They could try to tranq him on land.
I'm okay.
In Maine?
Same thing from Fish And Game.
What are you doing?
I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
Forgive me for trying to be nice.
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
Sorry.
Really--
<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!
We gotta get to Hector!!
Well...
If I'm ever in New York...
They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
Even if we <u>could</u> tranq him-- how would we get him on land.
He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.
Well.  At wakes.
You talk to the married couple?
You have a thing against museums?
I thought I saw...
What is this?
If he gets close, you go <u>up</u>, Hector, don't you endanger that cow.
This is what we do?
I'm not even a field person.
I <u>tapped</u> you.
"Desperately random." What does he mean?
But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order.
Where?
I will... I promise.
FBI, Catherine, you're safe.
You're all right! Where is he?
I'll get you out! Just be quiet so I can hear. Shut that dog up.  Is there a ladder? Is there a rope?
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts me. Or at least, he used to. If I could just -
Not to my knowledge. Privacy is a great concern to my customers. But, if you say this is an FBI matter...
That wasn't me.
You see, the one we want most refuses to cooperate. I want you to go after him again today, in the asylum.
Miggs has been murdered.
Why?
Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
Chilton has killed her, hasn't he? That slimy little bastard! We were so close with Lecter - and now her last chance is gone.
I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell?
Chicago's only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in -
Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
Maybe they'll catch up.
All flayed...?
Why? Do you know something about him?
I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.
Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
Who killed your patient?
That is both impudent and untrue... Tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our Billy's latest effort?  Or should I say, his "next-to-latest"?
I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
Horses - and sheep...
How long did you live there?
You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him.
The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual.
I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is.
Anger, social resentment, sexual frus-
No, he covets. That's his nature. And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer.
Yes. I'll tell you.
Your West Virginia specimen gave us quite a bit of trouble, but I finally managed to narrow his species through chaetaxy - studying the skin.
Better known to his friends as the Death's-head Moth...
Your "father"?
He did?
The Ottawa are gone.
In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...
How did you learn English?
They're going to hang you.  Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?
Are we safe?
And my compliments to you...
Where will we go?
The man encouraged the colonials to desert in this very room, in my presence. He is guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged like any other criminal, regardless of what he did for my children.
But the man is guilty of sedition and subject to military justice and beyond pardon.
Some say that's the way of it.
Will you consider that?
I see...
Day and a half  Where did you get... the guide?
Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better makin' a peace with the French!
Where do we go from here?
That we did. John. But the horicane  is near trapped out.
A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.
Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
I know.  One has to give Americans "reasons" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here.
Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...
Not with enough certainty to outweigh British interests in this fort.
Advance, Sergeant Major!
Right - about face! March! First rank present!
Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
France.
Not exactly a big ocean country.
It's got Hazy!
We don't have much choice... without air, the internal pressure will fall and--
No way...
You did good...
Why?  You going to give me hard time like the others?
Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line.  Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.
I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done.
They know, don't they?
It hit me!  Where are they?!
You got money in this tub?
You read Russian?
Yeah?  How'd the kid hold up?
Hey, man, you know that in Switzerland--and this country's the size of East L.A., okay?--they speak 54 different dialects? Fifty-four!
What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
What are you going to do to him?
Bigger than DeJesus?  How?
Are you sure you saw something?
Your pocket?
The latch is screwed up.  Or the hinge.
Probably no longer than four weeks.
How much did you part with?
Hatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man: Barry the Baptist.
Scarface, I have watched Scarface. You want to know how to do a drug deal, you watch Scarface!
He'll care all right. That was going to be his money. Whether he cares about us is different. Pass your phone.
The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because there is no evidence against us.
A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.
I hate these Southern shites.
I think I can help you, as it happens.
What are you doing?
How long has he been in there, son?
That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money- loaning business, all right, son?
That's no way to answer the phone.
Who was that?
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.
It must be this one.
Out the back.
Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
I will.
Go on.
Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?
And that does include the amp?
Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
Look. Go on, look.
At what, exactly?
So?
So, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty, for twenty-five grand invested. That's going on previous experiences.
Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course.
How the fuck should I know?
I don't know what the big deal is.
--you're going to be on your own.
I'm sorry, sir.
Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?
Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you.
No, sir. Not at all.
Private Johnson!
You're testing me?
That the word on our boy?
Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--
Charley Wade.
That badge--
Everybody on the border knows that story.
Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.
No, you look good. I was just wondering.
Yeah, well--
Suppose not.
Hey, it's the General.
If it's too late--
No sir.
Men worked for Santa Anna down there, waited out the Civil War. The land wasn't much to feed people on, so in 1870 they come north and put up at Fort Duncan and the men joined up what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. Best trackers either side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche--
Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--
Yeah. He lives here, right?
Right.
Maybe.
Mikey--
We been through this before--
It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post--
This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction.
Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.
That's right.
Right.
Why would you want to do that?
Donde esta? Estoy perdido--[Where are you? I'm lost--]
Como se llama? [What's your name?]
What are you doing out there? Are you crazy?
Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]
I thought you were married!
We have a daughter.
Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see!
Big day coming up--I wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living. But he went so unexpected.
They just wanted it to be one of theirs--
That's a matter of interpretation--
Never heard from him again?
Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning.
Bledso
Morning, Hollis.
Do you?
Imonna find out one way or the other.
And the ten thousand?
Steve. Board of Education Steve who likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls, I can tell.
Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.
These ones coming up are getting stupider every year.
He was killed.
We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
How come?
Well, you were working there--
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.
I was on the playground with all the other kids, but I thought he was only looking at me. I was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know--
You don't want to be Sheriff.
They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
Don't know if I'll still want it.
You telling me what to do, Roderick?
How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.
As I remember it was because he had a sassy mouth on him. Must run in the family--You wouldn't be runnin' numbers out of this club, now, would you, son?
Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.
Who is he?
I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.
I could have lost my fucking hands.
What do you mean, "all of us?"
What about death?
I'll tell you.
Anything?
If you've lied to me to me --
What is he?
Do you wish him to be amongst us?
Will you come to him on your knees?
And are you afraid?
Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?
Are they treating you okay?
I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
So why did you marry him?
No.
Are you sure?
Harry-?
Are you finished with me?
I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...
No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd maybe have a theory.
It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
I don't think the dead much care.
She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain.  Enough churning over the past.  She wants it all left alone.
Yeah, I know.
I want to see Swann face to face.
Shit...
She has no real grip on reality.
Does anybody?
I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
Are they all in the business?
You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.  That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?
So Nix won't come looking for her?
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
He's better off this way.
This is where we killed him.
Yes?
You don't think I've got it to give?
Why would I want to?
You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?
I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.
Not really. How long are you here for?
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this?
Of course.
I'm stuck. Does it get easier.
No, yes, it does...
Yeah? But look at you.
That's too scary.
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
Where'd you grow up?
John thinks I'm so snotty.
You are.
Nice one.
What happened to your toe?
You think so?
Charlotte?
Why are you crying?
Yes?
Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it.
It's just carpet.
Like Japanese food.
Oh, come on.
Hello?
Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.
You smell weird.
Shi... Sorry, honey.  I was having the weirdest dream.
I can't believe it's already starting to get dark so early.
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.
I'm still shaking.
You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
Quiet.  Real quiet...
Sure it is.  If the guards did this, we can file charges.
Mr. Kelson, what a pleasure to meet you. I have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable.  I am a fan.
Your court order, Dr. Allen.
There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
You'll do it?
Between your book sales and this TV thing, there's going to be no living with you.  And let me guess, you boiled God down to a conceit.
Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
You are my son.  Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
Father!  Thank God you're better!  I really need your help.  We've only got a few more hours.
So...we won?
How many weeks are you honey/
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?
You're sure?  There was nothing?
At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man, Peter.
I'm not going to be drawn into this.
I don't understand what's going on.
But I was baptized.  And I certainly wasn't born of incest.
When Townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like...  "The time of transformation is near..."
You okay?
What do you mean?
I'm scared I'm slipping back.
Close call.  For the first time in a long time, it's really hitting me. Life's tenuous.
What are these?
That's his, I don't know, his 'grounding' phrase for me, "together, no matter what."
Book five, Deuteronomy, chapter seven, verse five.  "But this shall you deal with them.  You shall break down their altars and burn their graven images with fire."
A lot of good that'll do.
It's useless...look at him.
What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
Lemme guess.  The lottery.
Well, long-term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject. After awhile, you begin to make friends with it, so to speak.
It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
Are you saying he's legally sane?
Right.  If you believe in God.  As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders.  He created the voices after the fact.  In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.
Seems George isn't making too many friends in lockup.
Yeah, look at that sweet face.  You'd never guess he killed nine people.  I'm gonna get my smokes.  Be right back.
I can't eat before a game.
How is he?
So what do I do?
Okay.
Can I take your coat?
That was nice.
Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh...
So how long is this trip?
Nah.
You need to.  She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind.
No.
You lost your head.
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
Coach hates me, doesn't she?
What's up, Sidra.
Can you take that damn thing off the table.
Just like that?
So what are these Spanish guys like?
You ever think about going back?
He works at a bank.
I don't care.
I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
Guess "please" would be a stretch.
Would you watch the damn road?
Figures.
What?
It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
Yeah.
I can't be nice to a fan?
Give me the ball.
What has he been to me?  I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing.  Like it was easy.  And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense...
Why not?
he's just playing, Q...
Talk to your new girlfriend.
I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.
Cheap date.
I just said I didn't fuck around.  But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me.
How are you going to tell me what I have time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this.
So that's it, just forget about us?
Tried calling you a couple times.
Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American.  And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again.
A rest?
Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your knee, and everything.
It just isn't.
And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough.
Maybe go back to school.
Why do you keep asking me that?
What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.
We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
You're out of your mind.
I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.
We should head over.
With who?
What?
We still have to go?
Later when?
Whose truth are you talking about?
Your mom got pregnant and I had to make choices.  You don't have a choice.
What mess?
Sorry.
Why?
We ain't got nothing to talk about.
So now you're saying my mother trapped you?
I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSSINESS. I HAVE BEEN A GOOD WORKER, A GOOD AND LOYAL WORKER FOR YOU, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE.
You smell like trouble --
Why don't they have the same last name? They don't have the same last name.
I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --
Get out of here, get the fuck out of my house --
FUCK YOU.  FUCK YOU, YOU GET OUT.
YOU BURN IN BELL.  You burn in hell and you deserve it -- YOU GET THE FUCK OUT.
Honey.
uh...uh...What is it?
For what?
Ok.  Claudia Wilson: You tryin' to go deaf?
Yeah, but I don't know --
No.
You mind if I check things back here?
Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?
Bit messy.
-- do you wanna cup?
Yeah.
-- is not my boyfriend.
What is it?  Did you forget something?
No, no.  I was wondering...man oh man. I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want to do which is to ask you on a date.
Yeah.
What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
Billingsley's?
...yeah...
Let's make a deal.
-- no, no, it's fine. Fine.
You don't how fuckin' stupid I am.
You don't know how crazy I am.
....now that I've met you.... Would you object to never seeing me again?
Where's Richard and Julia?
It's upstairs.
How much time do we have?
What do you mean, "like what?" -- you could get endorsments and shit --
I - just - thought - that - I - didn't want - I - didn't - I - didn't -
I think it's more complicated than that little man.
No school today.  My teacher got sick.
Tell me what you know, I'll tell you what I know --
I have love all over.  I even have love for you, friend.
I have love.
Who was it that said: "A man of genius has seldom been ruined but by himself."
You see?
Yes I do.
I've been a good worker --
He has Phil right now.
If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --
We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening?
This is the number for Hospice. Ok. Now. As far as the morphine pills go, there is something else to consider that can take the pain away that he is in, there is a very strong and very potent solution of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle, with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and it will certainly diminish the pain that he is in but you have to realize that once you give it to him; there really is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly cure his pain, but he will float in and out of consciousness, even worse than he is now, Linda.  I mean, any sign of the recognizable Earl will pretty much go away --
You do?
No.
She loves you.
Time lines, y'know?  I remember things but not so -- right there -- y'know?
You wanna call him on the phone? We can call him, I can dial the phone if you can remember the number --
Do you know Lily?  Phil..do you know her?
What?  Say it again...walking in the car?
All it takes is one second?
Let's talk about --
Yeah.
Where are you from originally?
Around here.
From '84 to '89.
no, no, no.  Certainly not.  I wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. Was that unclear?
Is Linda here?
About three weeks ago.
When they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes ....
What? What? What now?
Quietly, slow down, whoa --
Calm down.
You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't --
Are you lyin' to me?
I live alone.
What the hell is this Marcie?
You look great.
No.
It's just...too late for me to be fuckin' around.  I gotta stop. I gotta clean my brain of all the shit I've done that I shouldn't have done --
Yeah. Yes.
Yes.
I won't.
What happend to you?
I'm sorry.
I love you.
Will that help?
I don't know....
Why, well I think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean?
I think that you know.
...say it, Jimmy...
No, I'm just a friend.  What are you doing here, I mean...you know Claudia?
Want me to wake her up?
The money would go to Frank.  The court would put the money in the hands of a relative --
Shut the fuck up.
Let me call you a car, Linda.
Earl asked me, Linda, please, Linda, I'm sorry -- Earl asked me --
Hello.
mmmhmm.
-- what-what-what, ma'am -- I --
What would you like?
mmm.hmm.
Yeah.
yeah, I said.  Is that it?
What are they gonna do -- beat us?
Stanley if you don't fuckin' stand up and go over there I'm gonna beat your ass --
We need more dog food --
I didn't know the answer --
Stand up.
Are we gonna keep going with this game?
Yes.
..sorry...
..sorry...
....you have it...easy....you know? You have a father who loves you, huh?
....Why does he do it...?
I have money.
What is that?
It's frogs.  It's raining frogs.
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
Why would you ask now?  You never asked before!
Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty.
What do you propose to do?
Tonight!  Right now!  We steal a man from a royal prison, we hide in a country chateau among an assortment of saints and sluts such as only you could provide, and still you wish to tell me nothing?!
You can do it.
Hang himself?!
Aramis, this will never --
Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
He seeks redemption.
I will need you all.  All for one. One for all.
A tomb?  We're in a tomb?
And why are you so glum?
Can we eat... before we go?  This excitement's given me an appetite.
He gets one day of confession each year.  Today is the day.
What do we do now?
Fromberge...?!  At the front?!  No.
Thanks, but not for me.
They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.
You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.
Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.
Athos, please...!
The King killed my son!
Recent hours have been a shock.
What is its antidote?
Is that the king of king you wish me to be?  Or do you say this because of your son?
All this time... I was a lost secret.  But you were hiding all your loyalty, all your love.  You were the Man in the Iron Mask.
You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!
That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place!
... You knew you had a double?
Not once have I ever asked anything for myself.  I ask now.  Forgive this man, this prisoner... your brother.
Eh?
... Two-thirty-seven.
I would not have disturbed you, Majesty, but you ordered me to keep you informed --
Riots?  My people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?
I will order a Mass for his soul. It will guarantee his place in Heaven.
Every step of the way.
What?
Who am I?  I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me.  You understand? Where did you get the car!
And what did he do to the girl?
He said he was following up some lead.
Seattle.
Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
Six months ago, a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note, you may have heard of it...
Well where are ya, what are ya, drunk?
Holy shit -
No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
I knew I could count on you.
OK...county tax records...they're saying 1490 Breckinridge is owned by... an Atlantic Trust Corporation...they have a P.O. box in D.C.
How about Marvosa and the others?
I'm stranded out here.
Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
What?
That was Peterson upstairs.
He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.  He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
The Chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the Tattler right now.
Because it's his bad luck to be special.
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here...
Why not?
That was three years ago. And by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing.
Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right?  We'll get him one way or the other.
Why?
Sarah, order a chopper. I want the next thing smoking and I don't care whose. Ours. DCPD.  Or the Marines. Then call Documents. Tell them to scramble a team. I want everybody moving in five minutes.  Dr. Chilton, please do not handle the note. I have a Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up.
From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning.
He changes them into beings that accept him... And he needs to see the acceptance, In the mirrors.  I didn't understand the mirrors before.  It's very important.
What?
What's that?
We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in.  They're in the far corner of the room under the windows.
He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
He went to the men's room.
The activities of nocturnal animals.
When do you need it?
The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness. I keep the samples straight by touch code.  It's still easier to handle than a 1200 series. Think it'll do?
How did you come to Gateway?
I'll get my purse.
SHE'LL FUCK OTHER PEOPLE. PRETTY PEOPLE. SHE'LL PUT IN HER MOUTH THEIR...
What am I doing here?
According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said.  You know now, don't you?
Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds?
Do you believe God is in attendance here, Mr. Lounds?
I don't know...
Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds.
Do you see?
Mrs. Leeds harlequined with blood, her husband beside her. Do you see?
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
Oh, God.
Please, no.
'No' what?
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
You will tell the truth?
It's Will Graham...
How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious?
This is Will Graham. Can I help you?
Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you?
He's misunderstood.
He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet.
Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
To yourself...
What the hell can I do?
Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
You remember when we first met?  And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong?
No. I have to be in there...  alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days...
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
What's that?
Thanks for the lift.
Meet point's up ahead!
My name's Will Graham. I...
No, I'm okay. I just wanted to...  ...stop by and...
It's a precaution...  Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float.
How?
Did you get my card?
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
Do you dream much, Will?
Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
Kevlar Second Chance.
Sitcom...?
George, I hate sitcoms.
You signed for five years --  So four years, seven months.
You're so proud.  You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!"
Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  Demand a recount...
What was that all about?
You must take a little pleasure in it.
Do you wanna tour the clubs?
Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
Maybe I should talk to the natives.  Shoom boom boo ba!  Shoom boom boo ba --
Gosh, you scored!  Look at all those goodies!
No thanks.
Hi...
Popcorn?
They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
You're not listening to me --
You're a wimp.
"Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman? And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy Kaufman crazy?"
This is very difficult for me to say... but -- perhaps it would be best if you didn't attend the retreat.
Why??  I... I attend every year.
Please!  You've GOT to let me take the classes!  It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!
Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're not getting BOTH of them!  It's physically impossible!
Who is this? TONY CLIFTON  You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear.  Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.
It's a perfect Kaufman audience.
Where?
What's your name?
"Bob"?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.  Bob what?
He's gonna make it.
Who is it?
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.
Sorry.
No, it's all right.
Just get me outta here.
They'll be able to track it.
Morpheus...
Stand up and see for yourself.
I imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole?
You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.
Right now, we're inside a computer program?
You -- you're too fast.
This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson.
How does she know?
And she's never wrong.
Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut.
Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
Tank, charge the E.M.P.
I just thought... you were a guy.
How did you do that?
God...
What did you just say?
A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
No, Neo.  That's not true.  It can't be true.
What are you doing?
No, you're not.
Neo, how did you do that?
Can you fly that thing.
It's a city?
Holy shit!
Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?
What do they want?
Neo, this is loco.  They've got Morpheus in a military-controlled building.  Even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him.  Three of them!  I want Morpheus back, too, but what you are talking about is suicide.
Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?  Besides a miracle...
It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?
Whether she wants to or not...she's not going.
Keep quiet about this.  I don't have any license for him yet.  I've only had him a couple of days. Nobody can feed him except me.  I'm the only one he trusts.  Watch.
'Art thou the King of the Jews'?
'My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.'
'Thou art then a king?'
Panther!  Same thing...
You'd better make a move kid.  He thinks you're trying to screw him.
You couldn't handle shit.  You just better come through with some kind of payment on Tuesday...anything. Understand?  Hold onto your pay- check this week.
There won't be any this week.
Don't promise...just deliver.
Hey...you got nothing here.
I could have told you that.
Let's get out of here.
I swear to God Charlie...my arm still hurts from the car accident...that's why I didn't go to work.  I swear it.
Keep your mouth shut.
Don't be smart.
NO!!!  What do you think I am, crazy???
Don't ask...do you have any idea what I've been doing all morning...eh?
That bad, huh?
Nope...
All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of.  I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing.
$3,000.  Shit!  Can we hold it at $3,000?
You know Diane...I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a...  aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...I... a...I really...think that you're a terrific performer...
Fine.
I was thinking maybe you'd do very nicely for the place.
Ok.  Chinese.  We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.
Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?
Nothing.
Please take it.
See if you can get your hands on some pamphlets on laws or by laws...or proprietorship...you know...at your place.
Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...
Lower the fuckin music--I can't hear nothin.
Count it.
This is some boat.  Your father's?
Hey... you got stereo.
I know what you're going to say but don't say it.  These drinks are all on the tab.  I'm gonna see you this Tuesday payday, I promise.  I give you my word.
Just keep him quiet.
Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
That was 'Joe'.
He's cute.
Do they, m'dear?
That you've been to Susan?
I wasn't going to say --
Bill, thanks for coming over...  And how're you doing today, Drew?  You've got a firecracker here, the kid's really set the table.
I'm sorry, I don't recall --
That's it.  It's over.  Get out.
We have an arrangement now.
Yes.
Who are we talking about?
No, I don't --
I was saying to Quince we won't need --
Me, too.
I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew.  Forgive me.  I want you to know I value your advice.
Whose?
Thanks, Quince.
Are you?
But I didn't mean to do it!
He said that?
I from dat nex' place.
Rass!
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
What?
Don't bother asking, we already tried.
Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth leading killer of adult Western males.
Come again?
Joe --
Whatever you do.
No, I'm not.
I love your smell.
I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood --
Where are you going?
But there's so much to tell you --
The 'coffee shop' --
...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me.
So there's nothing between you and Susan?
Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?
Good morning, Bill.
And I won't tell anyone who you are.
Yes?
Yes.
Would you like to sit down, Joe?
Are you going to eat your lunch
Truly - uh - splendid.
Why did you go to the hospital?
What way would you put it?
Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.
I don't like what you're saying.
Joe, don't do this --
You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
It just occurred to me --
What are you talking about?
Are you giving me orders?
The great Bill Parrish at a loss for words?  The man from whose lips fall 'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses- sion'...all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy', what there is no sense 'living your life without...', all the sparks and energy you give off, the rosy advice you dispense in round, pear-shaped tones --
'Yes' is the answer to your ques- tion.
I'm doing great.  You ready?
I am, this is it.  B Day.
...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from.  And I'm with you a hundred and one percent.
No, anything is possible.  It's up to Joe.
This one.
Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you -- okay, Bill?
...It's not over, 'til it's over.
Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?
Drew told me.
You like him, don't you?
Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.
Don't get dirty, Dad --
Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.
Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
This is crazy --
Susan, I don't think Joe is going to be with us long.
You were right about Joe, he is going somewhere --
Are you relieved?
Daddy --
If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.
I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy.  He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it.  One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.
Why?
Sure, I'll give you the name of a doctor.  ...And I don't want to examine you.
79.
66.
Well, what then?
Condition?
Last week. Then I rented you another one On top of this.
Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.
What?
Is that what your little note says?
* So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  * 							   * The world doesn't disappear when you			   * close your eyes, does it? My actions			   * still have meaning, even if I can't			    * remember them. My wife deserves				   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether I know about it.			    *
Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
His name was Jimmy.
Where is he?
Calls himself Dodd.
What does he want?
Don't protect him.
What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
Don't talk about my wife.
What?
My boyfriend told me about you.
Did Teddy send you?
I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.
This is your car.
What the hell you want to go there for?
John Gammell?
So I see. It's good to see you. My name's Teddy.
Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here, right?
Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key.
Why are you here?
We've got to get him out of here.
Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
Who the fuck are you?
Why are you following me?
I won't be happy until you leave town.
How do you know him?
You tell everyone about Sammy. Everyone who'll listen. "Remember Sammy Jankis, remember Sammy Jankis". Great story. Gets better every time you tell it. So you lie to yourself to be happy. Nothing wrong with that - we all do. Who cares if there's a few little things you'd rather not remember?
She wasn't diabetic. You think I don't			 * know my own wife? What the fuck is wrong		    * with you?							*
Why? You're never going to know.				  *
Why do you keep lying to me?					 *
Gottingen.  That's in Sweden.
And...?
Yeah?
All I want to know is the where and the when.  Spare me mini moves, progress reports and bullshit.
What's "nothing"?
How fast does that go?
Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...
Later!  Do you dance?
I insist.
Blanca...a rubio like you.  I see her in a dress...an old photograph from Lucinda somebody's wedding...everybody is with couples.  Husbands and wives.  They all pose.  My mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting.  ...she looks right into the camera. She is the most beautiful woman in the room.  By herself.  In a party dress.  And she looked like she knew she would die alone...  She spoke many languages.  We were in Luanda when she died.  I went to her friends in Mali.  They sent me to the Ecole Polytechnique in Geneva to study mathematics, where I met Montoya in the discos.  He had banking there...I was seventeen and very much into the clubs.  And he sent me to University for an MBA in Finance.  Your mother?
Is it December?
What if I pushed to twenty-one...?
Would you find me...?
A few more moments, still in this business.  Then I'd find you.
I know.  And now?
You got something to say, Jos, let's hear it.
Track with me, here...  They knew the "Russians" were undercover Feeb?  They should have no-showed.  But, no, these guys show anyway, and commit murder upon federal officers.  And steal all your money...  What does that say to you?
"No, viejo.  That was Jos Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall."
Where we meeting 'em...?
You worried about the tree line, US Customs AWACS, or something else on your mind?
No.
No.
As in...?
4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.
How will it stand up?
On the phone.
Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash.
So?
...and we're looking at Nigerian crude...
It's all bullshit.  Jesus is out of communication in Fals de Iguazu. Jos knows that...  Whatever he's going to do, he has to do it fast because he's acting on his own. And he will need a story.
Alonzo...
You ain't coming to work?
Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
Yeah, oh yeah.
Cut it out. That's cheating, teasing me so I can't think. Just one bitsy Y word and I gonna beat you!
Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take that...
Now take it. Go on.  Listen, where can I reach you? Cause I'm gonna make this right with you soon's I get me set up...
You don't seem like no fag...
I'm impressed. You're a killer.
Shee-it, man, I can't say all that.
Shee-it. Cough yourself inside out, then light a fag, a goddam fag. You make me puke. Where'd you steal it? In the movies?
Forty-second Street. Where'n hell you think it come from?
Well, just exactly what the hell you think you're gonna do? Die on me?
These guys're good drivers.
They gotta be.
What d'you want?
No, yes. No, I mean yes please go. Help me to be good. Come back tomorrow. Promise.
I gotta have more'n ten. I gotta have fifty-seven dollars.
No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.
You got it.
Sold. Let's go.
Two kilos.
Tunnel?
You got that, shit face? Asina...
Want me to take over?
Hey, you know what's gonna get us out of here?  It's not a map, Max. It's our balls. You know what I mean...  ...I gotta get laid man, I don't know 'bout you guys, but if I don't get it on soon, I'm... I'm not gonna make it.
For the money... )
DAD!
Where are the minefields?
Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?
A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.
But just...
What's your father do?
He wasn't even in the car?
No... It looks like your going to have a new court.
And?
What?
You know where it is?
Just got some news on Bell.
I think I've been poisoned.
Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other man before he fuck you.  And you must fuck last.
His name?
Who?
The Department of Public Health...
For Chrissakes, what's the problem? You need a memo every time you fart?
It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.
What?
I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy...
Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
You give someone a fucking uniform and... Did you hear how he talked to us?
Don't.
So, you're saying this is like those bugs that -- that look like twigs or leaves or...
His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor!
We'll cover ourselves with this. They can mimic us-  we Goddam mimic them!
Don't touch it.  And for Godsakes, try not to sweat.  They can sense chemical changes...
C'mon...
...as long as they're ready for the opening I don't care, just tell them that.
That's impossible.  Insects don't...
I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.
How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay.  My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--
Will I be able to walk?
It shouldn't be too much longer.  Once the roads are open, the lines'll be up in no time. If you give me their numbers, I'll keep trying them for you.  Could I ask you a favor?  I noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and...  and I wondered if maybe... 
If you wouldn't mind.
What's it about?
Pretty rough so far.
My daughter must be going nuts.
I guess that means it's okay.
Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
Thank you so much.
I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted?
The Sistine Chapel?
Show me the way?
I guess you don't get bothered by neighbors much.
Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating?
That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...
--cliff-hangers--
I hope you like it.
I've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it?
Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
Annie, what is it?
Why would I want to leave? I like it here.
What?
Paul, this will be our legacy.
I was fooling, silly.  You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne.  Dome Pear-igg-non.
Did I do good?
He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
They're hauling Misery into court.
What is it?
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
He's your client, huh?
People sure like those Misery books.
Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange?
No, no, of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him...
So do I...
You're still a writer.
Marcia, you know I started "Misery" on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd have ended up writing her forever.  For the first time in fifteen years, I think I'm really onto something here.
I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study.
Did they win?
Well that depends.
Mmmm.
And you're happy about that?
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
Ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar. Big bloke, ginger hair. They're into something.
Exactly where is she?
We're due to take off.
That's it?  That's it? That's it?
How're we doin', then?
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
At least you walked.
Pull over and listen to me, will you? Just listen..
I need your help and I thin you can use mine.
Ethan Hunt.
Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.
Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?
Damn, you're beautiful.
Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life.
And that's the only reason?
Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but I guarantee he's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world, for what they might be saying about him, if nothing else - he's got the ability and, we assume, the desire to get you out of there.
How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.
Just like old times?
I want <i>you out of there.</i>
Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
An idea, yeah.
When I couldn't find you, I had to replace you.  Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice. He double you, what?  Two, three times?
Twice.
Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it.
She's got no training for this kind of thing.
I don't think I can get her to do it.
Nekhorvich specialized in recombining DNA molecules.  In the myth, Bellerophon killed Chimera, a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world.  I think Nekhorvich has created a monster virus in Chimera and apparently the means to kill it in Bellerophon.
Sorry, that it a Biocyte facility, their storage structure..
She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs.  One klick away.
You wanted the disease in order to peddle the cure.
And if we dont find him - well search the whole train again.
But why tell us?
You knew about Jim?
Dont Jim.
Krieger can get it.  Right?
Did we get it?
Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay.  It's Claire. Ethan what's wrong with you?
What?
Who sent you?!  Who sent you?
Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
Max made a deal with you?
We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
I didn't say that.
Is this the only way?
Yeah.  I follow you.
Yes.  I see your point.
What?
This whole operation was a molehunt.
Kittridge.
What kind?
Krieger <u>did</u> have the NOC list.
I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.
The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
Ah, but, we're asking about you.
Mm - Hmmm...
I'm going to have to front you personally.  Don't lose that money without losing your life.
What about Job?
You're not going to any meeting without me.
In position.  Jack open the door, let the package roll.
Ethan.  Hes out of pocket.
I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me.
I guess.
You're going to use Walter?
Where are you?
Kitteridge.  Oh my god!  Kittridge is the mole?
We dont have to, Jim.  Hell come after us.
Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
Hi.  Hi.
Where's Ma?
I won't come.
Maybe.
Yeah.
Oh, Cosmo!
He's in Palermo.
Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat!
Maybe I should come back another time.
That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
How'd he die?
Bus hit him.
Fast.
I can't believe what is happening.
Your blood.
I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
It's so bright.
What?
I'll come to the wedding.
But he wants me to come!
What?
That was just so... awful!
No thanks.
You're making me feel guilty again.
I'm here!
That's right.
I went with you.  Now I'm gonna marry Johnny and you're gonna leave me alone.  Right?  A person can see where they've messed up in their life, and they can change how they do things, and they can change their Luck. Maybe my nature does draw me to you, but I don't haveta go with that. I can take hold of myself and say yes to some things and no to something that's just gonna ruin everything! I can do that. Otherwise, what is this stupid life that God gave us for what?  Ronny? Are you listening to me?
Is Johnny here?
He's coming.
I got things to do.
Hi Loretta.
It's Johnny Cammareri.
A man who can't control his woman is funny.
Yes, on the floor.
Then let's set the date.
I'll call you when I get to Mama's house.
Loretta, I can't marry you.
Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him?
Where's pop?
Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
That's a pretty big sin.
You should think about this.
I have heard that Johnny Cammareri got down on his knees in The Grand Ticino and proposed to her.
Don't fight.
Talk to him.
Moving in?
That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
Who was that?
You don't know where Loretta is?
Loretta...
May I presume to ask you a question?
I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.
That woman was a student of yours?
Don't shit where you eat.
I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
I'm freezing
Cosmo. Many years ago, when they told me you were marrying my sister, I was happy. When I told Rose I was marrying Rita, she was happy.
Cosmo.
Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
She looks like one. Yes, she does.
Ah.  Yes, of course ... um ... err ...
Halt!  Who goes there?
Get away!
Where did you get the coconuts?
Found them?  In Mercea.  The coconut's tropical!
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
Who are the Britons?
NI!
Oh!
We want ... a shrubbery!
All right!  All right! ... No more, please.  We will find you a shrubbery ...
Thanks you, Knights Who Say Ni!  You are fair and just.  We will return with a shrubbery.
Oh, please!
What?
Now stand aside worthy adversary.
I've had worse.
You'll what ... ?
All right, we'll call it a draw.
Ni, ni, ni!
Ni!
Oh, shut up.
What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...
Well ... I AM king.
... But all the decision of that officer ...
Be quiet!
And don't apologize.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ... What are you doing now?
I'm averting my eyes, Lord.
Well?
Make a bridge out of her.
You're not fooling anyone you know.  Isn't there anything you could do?
What is your name?
To seek the Grail!
Here's one!
I dunno, Must be a king.
Really, I feel fine, sir.
Do you want to come and have a drink?
One day, lad, all this will be yours ...
I don't want land.
We don't need to do anything, apart from just stop him entering the room.
Leaving the room ... yes.
If we ... er ... 
No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
Right.
Okay.  Fine.  We'll remain here until you get back.
We're coming with you.
We are just not used to handsome knights ...  But you are wounded!
Camelot ...
You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
Look, it's my duty as a knight to try and sample as much peril as I can.
... I Bet you're gay.
You got my note!
Hurry!
When you have found the shrubbery, then you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with a herring.
|      You turd! +      Mangy scots git!
He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who ...
You know what I mean.
And she sent no word down?
You've got three broken ribs, man!
And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
What did you say?
Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.
No dinners, Bertie.  Why are you dressed for outdoors?
We --
How will I know?
Her Highness' Equerry.
Awaiting my orders.
You will await your orders like everyone else.  Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement.
I thought I made myself perfectly clear.  You do not leave your room until Her Majesty requests it.
If I find out that you had anything to do with this, I will have you sacked.
Don't think I can't persuade her.
This is a slur on her good name.
Nobody has any rights over me.
The look on their faces when one walks into the room.  Still gives one a ridiculous thrill.
The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public.  John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense.
See what?
The threat.  I tell them, but they don't see it.
Ma'am.
My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you.  He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way.  I trust it does not inconvenience you too much.
If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two.
-- When I took you out riding, come rain or shine, because I knew it was right for you, when I kept the bairns off your back so you could have a bit of peace, when I saw you safe from home to home and you didn't even know I was there...!  All I've ever thought about is you!
Then they may read about me.
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
So?
You can't know that for sure.
Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?
Not too protracted, I hope.
Thanks, Albert.  Think you could print up those schematics?
It's twelve-thirty!
No, wait.  Just listen.  I hooked it up earlier tonight, and it said my name.  As soon as I turned it on, Nick.  It said my name.  How could it know?  And then, I asked it where Greg was, and it said, "In here".
See, men always do this.  "Quiet down, honey.  Chill out.  Take a Valium". I'm not a fucking idiot, Nick!  I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!!
It's not this weird.  It'll make sense. Everything gets weird this late anyway, right?
Where to now?
This is like a movie or something.  I mean, am I paranoid or what?
It doesn't necessarily mean she's...
What?
Virgin sacrifices?
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
I'll take the lead and handle the physical threats.  You watch the elapsed time and look for exits.
The clock's already ticking.
So how did you do it, Alex?
You have no time.  What is your question?
Is...is that where we are?  Did I die?
"Escape"?
So how do I start?
What's going on, Cynthia?
I'm going home.
I'm going home Cynthia.
Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls.
Cynthia... that would not be a good idea.
I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.
We'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role.
The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.
Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
I...
It's unbelievable!
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
You're still here?
Yes, there was.
Number 17.
She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that.  I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel.
I think I've been hurt.
Mulholland Drive?
Okay.
I'm not sure about this.
I'm all right.
It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.
Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
You're so easy.
I had a dream about this place.
Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along the shoulder ... man up the road said he saw two cars drag racin'...then you got that blind corner.
Could be unrelated.
Where at?
Palmdale.
You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?
That's it folks for the Demon Boat Ride.... Everybody off. Watch your hands and feet.
Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
It won't take them that long to figure out we weren't on the train when it wrecked.
So why this ?
Just remember, hold your breath as long as you can. Then go right over to that corner. The door will open and go in and up.
That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
Hey buddy, thanks for the help back there !
The room has sound sensors. If you wake it up, it breathes fire.
What the fuck are you talking about.
Knock yourself out.
He's the liaison for McCay. Listen go. Go now.
Never underestimate a man who cheats on his taxes. His file says he is an avid jogger.
Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?
When I think you're ready.
Fire the whole division.
Then what do you want ?
I didn't think even this company could afford to write off enough to build a new "Park".
Was that the Old Man ?
Do you want to go out with me ?
As appealing as that sounds...
Dinner at my place then ? Say, seven o'clock ?
Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?
Hey, you ! What the hell is going on ?
I think I'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination.
It's that asshole Zach isn't it ?
Good morning.
I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....
Umm, where do you want this?
Do you still teach?
I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
THANK YOU.
What kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in?
I'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew Vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.
She was the uhh...first girl ever suspended for smoking.
I'm not authorized to trace licenses for civilians.
Yeah, this is Sergeant Tanaka from Holenbeck, I need a current address for a Jeffrey....
I'm leaving Sunday.
Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....
You want me to move?
Visualize a spare?
I already bought a ticket.
Hi honey.
We have a baby?
She can spread her wings, right here in Pennsylvania. You don't send a child alone to Los Angeles, she could come back with her ears pierced, her legs shaved and God knows what else.
Reason? What reason?
I'm sorry I couldn't come pick you up honey.
Thanks.
Bye.  She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.
Wait...woah...woah...wait a minute...Do you think I'm your father?
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?
Then what did she do?
It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
This is really very nice of you.
He's writing. Hello?
If the fruit burst into flames I'll be prepared.
Just remember the needle in the haystack.
Change my name.
If he has a heart attack you're carrying the body down yourself.
Maybe it'll fit my pinkie.
Just come and get it...right here!
What are you doing? You can't go in there!
What's he smoking?
But we wouldn't really be related right?
Wow!
I don't think the color of the interior is....
Committed.
I had to be, I only have five days. So just point me in the right direction and....
Then you'll be all set.
Wait, are you saying that I don't appreciate?
You really think I look sexy in this smock?
I'm just tired.
Excuse me?
Well I'm sort of involved.
Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?
I wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere.
Really?
Good for you baby.
Of what??
The boss is watching us...
You are perfectly healthy.
Can't you see it?
It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.
Yes they are.
Excuse me, what about the job?
You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone.
I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it.
I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you're welcome to.
I ahh, better go.
It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her only friend in the world is dead.
I know that, but what do you want from me?
Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?
It's for school, for summer writing class.
Goodnight Vada.
Why?
He's okay isn't he?
I found this.
What was my mama like?
She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.
Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?
Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.
Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.
How are you gonna get the money for this old house if you're not working?
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss you.
No....
Cause she's dying.
Why do you think she says that?
Do you like her?
Is that your camper?
Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.
He won't give it to me.
Are you married?
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing.
Goodnight.
Uh huh.
Is that your Dad?
Who's that with your Dad?
Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.
I am not.
Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.
What?
Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
You're such a retard, it was an engagement ring.
No.
Okay, okay.
Say something it's too quiet.
What?
You don't miss much.
Needs salt.
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.
Go figure you.
Zit cream?
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
I did what I came to do.
Well, we're...
Excuse me?
But I can't be dry.
Can you watch the road?
You can't believe what it'd cost to bring in a temp.
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
I'm not joking.  I had to face up to all my competitive drives, and believe me, I've got 'em.
I was gonna predict that.
Ju...
About Michael's job.
I never want to go through this again.
... look good on Kimberly.
Is anybody watching?
It's a fax from Sports Illustrated from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss.
W...
What's the sec...
Luckily.  The closer I watched, the more the fault came into focus.  Each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability.
Such as.
You never eat when you're despondent.
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
I can hardly wait for your wedding.
Dance card filled?
Isabelle?  I need to talk to Kim...
I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.
She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
Oh, yeah.
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...
Why would she come here...
I never forgot that.
All of a sudden, I'm supposed to drop out of school, forget my family, forget my career, forget all the plans I had for my life...
Well, if that's the way you f...
Nose tackle from the Bears... power forward from the Bulls... defenseman from the Black Hawks... my personal favorite, the designated hitter...
What's wrong honey.
Don't feel that way, honey.
Well, I have to go thank her for filling in and it's nice to know the tune she sang.
Oh, honey, I didn't mean to scare you.
It's fine. We were just talking about Vitamin S.
She's fine.
Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.
He's going to run for president.
Where'd he ever see us?
D.C.
President?
You're kidding.
Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.
Yes, sir. I need a room
Replacement party.
Well, he's really amazing.
No.
Nashville.
The car broke down.
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.
Bye.
Isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir?
Yes, it is --
Do you ever do any writing?
No, I don't.
Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you.
Well...How have you been?
Who is thin?
I've got a gig tonight.
You're really terrific, you know what I mean --LINNEA rolls over and faces him.
Oh.
I'm forty-six. Do you like to go up or down?
You know who that is?
You're not.
Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?
I know a couple.
I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?
No -- That's exercises. My coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched. Every time you stretch them, the middle part sets stronger. That's the place where I sing.
That's what Tim said.
Thank you. Grace, there is one other thing...
What did you think then?
Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
Now, when we get out there, you do what we say or it's curtains. If we say move, you move. If we say left, you move left. If we say right, you move right. If we say mole, you dig a hole. Got it?
Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
Using the same doctors is not common practice.
So can we. So the solution to our little problem is we had them deemed crazy. And we're shippin' 'em to Nystrom Asylum for the criminally insane.
Lobotomy Bay?
Who's the song bird?
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
She was born without a tongue.
Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?
Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.
Don't worry about it.
So, Mickey, tell us what you do for fun.
Was what worth it?
Do you think up these questions or the girl with no tongue?
That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.
Describe Mallory.
Yeah baby.
That's the way of the world.
They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
Roger?
Waitin' in the lounge.
How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?
Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
It sure is.
Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?
Wayne, if it was anybody else---
Three.
Give her a beer.
Boy - you hear me?!
I bet she's a sly little nigger, that girl. Wouldn't mind a piece of her myself!
Who're you tellin' to get, boy?! You watch it, or there'll be some dyin' done 'round here!
I know.
What d'you want?
Yeah. Look, I'll be sendin' you the money from now on.
Guess I don't.
Where was your father born?
Been over to the other mill?
It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
You working?
Went to college, huh?
That's why you come back, huh?
What?
At first it was real strange. Hell, Japan is a long ways from Alabama. Really got under my skin, though. Almost didn't come back.
What d'you mean?
I didn't know you had one.
Are you married?
Look, baby - I don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. I just know it is. So, what d'you say?
I can see why.
What about them?
You jivin' me?
How come you keep askin'?
Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
Ain't you goin' to say something?
When I get set, I'll send for you.
I don't think that'll happen.
Duff--
Where' you goin'?
What's so hot 'round town?
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
Good-bye, Frankie.
What's on your mind?
I said, I come to town with a girl.
No.
I asked you somethin', boy!
No, thanks.
How often is that?
Come back some other time, will you?
Come on, Pop.
No thanks, Lee.
Sure.
How are you?
I doubt it.
Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.
Baby - want you to meet Duff.
Nothin'.  She's all right. Wouldn't have made it without her. Christ - haven't worked in eight months. Right now, I'm waitin' for some insurance money. And man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more.  Let's get out'a here. This place gives me the willies.  You got some money?
Got a thick feelin' here.
I fucking hate Raoul.  Shut the fuck up, asshole! someone.
Your Raoul?
Whoa.  No way.  You can't enter the kill zone.
You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...
You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.
The corporate plundering of Yeshoto Industries... At first these seemed like unrelated incidents, but a pattern is emerging that suggests otherwise.
Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.
What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.
And then?
I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
Fried Air Tram in the process. Not to mention half my gear.
Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier.
You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote "Wintermute".
Tell me the words.
Fine, Dixie. Fine.
Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.
Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.
The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
We got problems topside.
Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.
One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
It's coming.
What?
Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
I hope you can show more than you did when you let the Yakuza butcher Linda Lee.
He's a resourceful guy, your boss. How long you work for him?
Couple of months.
The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.
Le Vingtieme Siecle. We're meeting Armitage there for the midnight floor show.
Something exotic I hope.
He projects with neural implants.
Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.
Like what?
So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be?
Petty good.
How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?
Gus, have you ever been in love?
Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
Hi. You're here for the sex talk?
I'm concentrating on my career right now.
Anita!
Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
Uhh, no.
He's my teacher!
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
Better person than I.
Are mom and dad here?
Jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore.
Are you crazy?! You can't do this.
With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
Hi, everyone.  I don t think we've met. I'm Sam Coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me Sam.
You like her?
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
Our penguin, right?
You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
I told you you could write, Josie Geller.
I don't know.
That is so sad --
We'd love to transition a gay guy into the group.
Hi. I'm Tracy and I'm sixteen and I'm a gymnast and I don't have a boyfriend...
Thank you.  I'm Rob.
We followed your instructions.
Where're we taking him?
The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally... I thought I'd find you here....
I know.
I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
<i>                      -- A bow? --        But why? --                  How ugly! -- What's in it? --                What's in it?</i>
I told you I want that room unpacked.
Where's Jesse?
There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
What the hell are you talking about?
Oh Jesus.  I'm gonna be sick.
You're fucked in the head.
I figured you might like some help.
Sorry.  Schneider id it to me again.
Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...
I don't know - into the air I suppose.
What about "essential energy" the soul.  Does that go into the air too?  You think there's a good energy and a bab energy?
C'mon, cut it out.
Disappointed?
About not finding any bogey men?
It's gone now.
You want to talk about it?
You should eat something - you'll feel better.
I'm not hungry.
I think I better go.  I'm just not into it tonight.  I'm sorry.
Fred Krueger.  He's been trying to get hold of me, to use me.  He needs me to get out of his world into ours...He's gonna take me again.
You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear.  Fight him, Jesse!
Maybe we should call a doctor.
Hi, Kerry.
They've gotten worse since I took away her credit cards.
Hi Mom.
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
They're healing up nicely.
You pulled me in somehow, didn't you?
When I was still a kid.  My folks got divorced.  After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.
That man in my dreams.  He's real isn't he?
I haven't been able to do that since I was a little girl.
That was different.
They sedated me.  We're stuck here till it wears off.
Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.
Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.
Never been here before?
I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
I can't believe I just did that.
I'm running out of answers. A patient sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access.  A girl, alone in a room, dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television set. Nothing makes sense anymore.
For what?
Who would know where they were hidden?
What was that?
Science...I suppose.
Freddy.
That's enough, Kincaid.
Elizabeth, I'm prescribing Hypnocyl.  It's a dream suppressant.
Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
In the name of Elric, Prince of Elves, demon begone.
I'm in.
I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
God, that's an enormous arse.
'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'
So tell me Anna -- what do you do?
I'm an actress.
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
Fifteen million dollars.
Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.
No.
I forgot my bag.
I apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment.  Disaster...
You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.
Are you busy tonight?
Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.
Let's go in.
It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long.
So who left who?
Hand it over.  Basic plot?
'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'
Well, get a message through to him too.
Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.
You know what they say about men with big feet?
Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed.
Okay.
Hello.
Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
I thought I'd give it to you.
Sorry about that.
I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.
Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.
Thank you, Bernie.  Hey -- nice surprise, or nasty surprise?
Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'
Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
Yup.
Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
Shame!
If anyone gets in our way -- we have small nuclear devices.
Da Vinci?
Ahm... room service.
How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
Imagine -- somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.
Hey.
There's something wrong with the goggles though...
Spike.
Yes.
And you get on very well.
No -- you're right.
What he's going to say next is -- there are people starving in the Sudan.
Right -- let's talk about rent...
Are you sure you...?
All in good time, Mister McMurphy. All in good time.
Just that I'm glad to be here, Miss Ratched. I really am.
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
Mister McMurphy, this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes, so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff. However, the cardinal rule, and I must emphasize this: Everyone keeps their seat during the meeting!
Mister McMurphy. Patients aren't allowed in here.
Yes, Mister McMurphy?
I wanna report a robbery!
Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!
Oh, I had them removed.
Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast...  You too, Mister McMurphy.
That was the first time you attempted to commit suicide, wasn't it?  You must try to talk about it, Billy.
Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group therapy.
You men remain seated!
Miss Ratched, would you please save a space for my aunt? She's comin' down from Portland.
What's your name, buddy?
Break it up, God dammit! Ain't I got enough troubles without you guys messin' around... can't depend on nobody.
That's okay, kid...
So long, kid.
Wh-wh-wh-wh...
So long suckers.
I-I-I'm w-w-wet...
Ah-ah-ah-are y-y-y-you g-g-g-going t-t-t-to muh-muh-muh-marry her?
In ya go...
Sock it to 'em, kid!
In there.
Shit, Rose! What's there to decide? There's only four of us.
Yeah, Mack?
I'm leaving. Goodbye!
Where ya goin', Mac?
Charlie, ya can't ever let those goons outta ya sight! Understand!
Neither do I...
What are you doing?
Did to me?
Miss Ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse, not some, some kind of monster pecking out our eyes!
Ya owe me twenty-five bucks.
Don't you have any clubs?
Yeah, buddy?
Gimme the ball!
I saw thum! I saw thum!
Yeah, it's cold!
My turn.
Oh, what was that?
Doc, what can I tell ya?
Well, I was turnin' this dilemma over in my head, when I happened to hit on that old tub room out there, an' I said to myself, McMurphy, I said, that place would make a great second day room. A sort of game room for the young fellas. Whadaya think, Doc?
Time out!
It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes...
You think it's funny, huh?
You want me to show ya! You want me to show ya how!
He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian!
Okay, Mack!  Whoowe, Candy girl, are we in an insane asylum or ain't we?
Sure, she understands what you mean. She's not dumb. Why do you think Rose came to visit us? Rose is very interested in hospitals and hospital facilities. Aren't you, Rose?
Yeah, how much you wanna bet?
On what?
There they are!
Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall day...
This way, Mister McMurphy.
Hey, Sam, bet ya two bucks ya lose.
Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
What kind of crap is that???
Ya fuckin' coon, you're not on the ward now!
Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.
Whew! Hiya, boys!
What happened?
You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
She's been acting weird lately, though.  I shoulda seen it coming. Babbling on and on and on about "communication".  Like I don't know how to communicate.
Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
Who's dying?
I'm a liberal!
I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.
And, he's a friend of yours.  It's Dwayne.
What's mezzaluna?
I'M NOT PUSHING IT.
Larry, can I borrow your car keys?
Thanks.
Who's this?
Damon Bradley...
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
Where are you going?
That's not the point.
You're limping.
Yes.
There must be something I can do, something I can say to make this up to you?...  Just tell me what it is, I'll say it.  I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me.
Fine.  Okay.  Forget me.  Leave me out of it.  But don't go throwing your life away on somebody you don't love.
Uh, I'd rather not say.
Oh, thanks.  Well, have a good time.
It seems like ever since I found out about this guy, this name, I've been kind of crazy.  Like I was on drugs or something.
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
Reptilian swine.  There's no such thing.  Reptiles aren't swine.
I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?
As I recall, you were on your way home.  And I didn't want you to go so, yes, I told you a little white lie.
I was wondering...  Do you have dinner plans?
Tonight?
Any night.
Sure.
Oh, hello.
So, you say you've been to Italy before?
I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?
Is everything okay?
Yes you did.
Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.
But what?
Let me tell you something about love.  There are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers.  Love is hard work.
You don't have a passport.
Because you were afraid to fly.
Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.
The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
You can't really blame him for being upset.  It was an Armani suit.
So?
What is it?
I'm hungry.
So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway?
Anna, I'm Faith.  You don't know how happy I am to meet you.  You see, I'm trying to find someone, and--
All of the sudden, I'm feeling kind of nervous.  God, I hate blind dates.  Why couldn't we just have arranged marriages in America?
Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.
No one's perfect, Kate.
He's a jerk.
What about Larry?
I'm fine.  Have you seen Peter?
You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
Giovanni, this is Faith's friend, Peter.
It's siesta.
You think I'm just one of those Italian Casanovas.  The guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way.  Who prey on unhappily married women.  Who lure unsuspecting--
You miss me?...
Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
You used to love it when I called you doll.
She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
Where is she?
What do you mean, odd? We was robbed like I told you.
But my own kid bro
I thought they'd talk to him. Try to get him to dummy up.
Maybe he gave them an argument.
I figured the worst they'd do is work him over a little.
Gee, Charley, I'm sure glad you stopped by for me. I needed to talk to you. What's it they say about blood, it's 
That's right... .
There's a slot for a boss loader on the new pier we're opening up.
Don't say that!
None of your business.
I remember you were in trouble all the time.
How would you've done it?
Pardon me while I reach for my beads.
The things that go on.
Listen, you like beer?
It's quite  nice.
Isn't everybody part of everybody else?
He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.
All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you.
I I brought this for you, Terry. It was Joey's.  Yours is coming out at the elbows.
I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.
Charley.
Am I on my feet...?
Never will be much too soon.
I guess it's pretty tough work at that.
Yeah. My own blood and they sell me out for a lousy bet I had it in me to hit the top and  Boy, if I wanted to, the things I could tell you about them guys 
Didn't you recognize him, dopey. That's Old Man Doyle.
Take it easy now, Terry.
Hit me again.
Go on, beat it!
A dime, Terry, a dime for a cup of coffee?
Leave her alone, I tell you!
Where?
Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.
Those creatures..!
Yes I feel it in my bones.
Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault.
She pleases me.  Permit her to live in the World of the Snakes. 
Yes, yes yes I know all that.
I would have time for my own pleasures!
Oh, if there is only time!
The time...is short.
Then why do you shake so?
Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty.
I said not as a rule.
I want to speak with you, please.
Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
Adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get caught.  I'd like to get him before he does something else, makes it worse on himself.
Ask him his name.
You did work for Emil, right?
I bet that's all the hacks they send out.  Otherwise nobody's left to mind the store.
We may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where?
I don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out.
You want to take her to my place and get cleaned up?  You come out of the bathroom with your after-shave on and she goes, "Oh, I had you all wrong"?
You're just jealous it was me in the trunk with her and not you.
There's some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink.
There's something about a nice hot bath, transforms a person.  It's not just about opening up your pores, know what I mean?  There's just something about the heat and the wet that's calming you know?  Settles me in a way that I really can't articulate.
There's a store around the corner, I'll be right back.
Chino's gonna wanna talk to me.
How long you talk to her?
Two hours.
Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth.
I get that feeling, yeah.
Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
But don't you <u>do</u> anything.  You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.
Sure, Daniel.
Now.  What is it you wanted to tell me?
Yeah, why?
You want, I tole you you can come. You all right, Foley.  I like you.
You see what they doing, those posts out there?  Putting up another fence, five metres on the other side of the one that's there.  We wait until Super Bowl Sunday, they could have the second fence built and we have to dig another nine, ten days.  So we going soon as it's dark.  You want -- I mean it -- you can still come.
Who was the friend?
Hello?
Yeah, I got a problem.  This is the dumbest fucking shakedown in the history of dump shakedowns.  Three hundred bucks for a pillow?
I bet.  How much?
Just like it.  Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?
Reggie, push off and hit, man.  Push him off.
Where's your gun, your pistol?
Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.
If they get set up in time, which I doubt.  And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford.
Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.
It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on the floor.
You don't act like it.
What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
It was just a year, give or take a few days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know?  That spark, you know what I mean?  You gotta have that.
We still talk, though.
Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...
I never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick.
I mean, romantically.
None of your business.
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
I wasn't sure you caught that.
You coming back?
You're not dumb.
I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you.
Oh, hey, Studs?  We thought you were somebody else.
I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.
I thought you guys were busted.
Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?
You know who they are?
Sounds high, doesn't it?
Thanks for your help.
You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
I know what you're talking about.
Foley?  That you?
Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here?  What's going on?  Who's upstairs?
What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're gonna kill you.
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
You busted out?
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close.
Glenn, are you trying to steal this car?
The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
Right now, son.
It's all right with you, I'll just hang in the car.
Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the Cubans.  Linares.
Flyweight.
You're not my type.
What's wrong with you?
Glenn?  No, I don't know any Glenn.
Here?  In this house?
Your dog was killed?
Where do you think I might find Maurice?
Technically.  They're separated.
Hello?  Yeah, she is.  Just a minute.  For you.
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
You wave back?
Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?
I told you, he isn't here.
Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
But...they called you Strange?  Because of Red Grange?  I don't get it.  Was Red Grange strange?
Sir, I --
Hey.  You.  Mr. Coma.
What lizard?
Yeah.
Earl!  You said the planes were ready but -- but what?
Who the fuck taught you to fly?
Yeah.
Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here.
This ain't a little feud, Earl, it's World War Two!
Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna make it.
We've always tried to beat each other.
It's not getting any longer.
Hey!  What is this, the planes all bunched up like that?
Lieutenant... I'm Danny Walker.  I'm Rafe McCawley's best friend.
Before Rafe left, he asked me to be the one to tell you, if it happened.
You were more like brothers.
We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
Well...sure.
And where's the secret base, Sir?  The one we t-takeoff from.
C-Colonel, we been p-practicing takeoff's, but I ain't sure we can land on these carriers d-decks.
Then wh-where do we land?
That's bullshit, son.  But it's really good bullshit.
Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire your decision.
No, he...got some news today.  He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.
I called my folks, then Colonel Doolittle.  The Colonel sent a man to pick me up.  They wanted to debrief me. I told the Colonel I needed to see somebody first, and he had a supply flight heading out in an hour.  I've done a lot of talking.  You haven't said anything.
Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.
We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port.  I don't like this.
The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it.
Let's go.
I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you.
You should have left here years ago, like I did.
Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years.
Would you?
Yeah. Like that.
Great, isn't it?
You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!
Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
What am I going to do with you?
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
What?
I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain.
Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today.
Sorry. These fountain pens are so tricky.
I beg your pardon?
Fine.  ) Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
Five more weeks of school. And ten minutes past graduation I'm gone.  To freedom.
But what about the other night? We were like two stars in the same constellation.
It's Charlie!
Ssh. He's great.
Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humor.
That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into.
It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen.  Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.
You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea?
It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
Oh no!
Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little lightheaded.
What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
Sort of.
Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.
I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? Like leotards.
What's up?
Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
What was?
I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.
Okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible.
How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
Wbat're you talking about?
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
What are you talking about?
The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
Like what?
I came to say goodbye.
When I was young I thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys.
Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I'll give you som antibiotic cream--
What happened to you?
I hope he doesn't have rabies.
How long ago did this guy retire?
What's wrong?!
Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.
Who was that?
Hey! Where're you off to?
Just out.
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works...  ...he'll come back alive.
I don't know what to do, Bob.
Bob...
I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.
What's wrong with you?
I know that, Charles.
We've been talking it over, Andy. Your future that is... We feel that, because we respect you so much, we have to be honest with you.
Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal.
It's okay. Can I sit down?
One week old.
For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.
A regular all-American guy?
No. I didn't.
Do you need a break?
Some do. I didn't.
That's right.
Answer the question, please.
Gillman says I'm fine. My blood work is excellent. T-cells are up. Just a sec ...  Yes, I think that would alleviate most of our concerns.  My platelets look good too.
He was losing weight. He looked kind of tired sometimes. But he was working so hard... Still, I felt something was wrong.  And I can't believe <u>they're</u> saying they didn't notice anything.
In what way?
And, when lawyers break the law, when this society loses respect for the law, when that day comes, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground, and our children and grandchildren will live like savages.
Objection!
The guy sat in my office! You can't get AIDS that way, right?
Unprotected sex with a prostitute.
Aren't you?
Duh...
Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.
Fine, Joe.
Yes, we did.
<u>She</u> didn't try to conceal it.
So you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise, is that correct?
But didn't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct?
By God you <u>will</u> settle it! If you force this case to trial, young man, you'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days... Now, Joseph. What would you require to settle this matter today?
Based on what my client would have earned over the next three years, including benefits and projected raises, and the extraordinary cost of medical care for someone with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome... We would settle today for the very fair amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars.
Wait a minute. The man was fired for incompetence, not because he has AIDS. You didn't know he was sick, did you, Bob?
Audrey? Oh, Audrey....
You mean...tonight? With all those things still out there?
What whispers?
You did this? To yourself?
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
Entered our minds.
We can, can't we? Trust you?
What about her?
Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
I promised them we'd go back with more light. And that's exactly what we're gonna do..
Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
What, you're afraid?
Possibly.
Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
Didn't bite.
Like what?
So why isn't it all bloody?
Well, don't ask me to.
Little ratty-ass.
Let's wait on the power cells.
Look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially. How scared is she gonna be out there?
How much you weigh, Johns?
What the hell's it matter?
He'll lead you over the first cliff. You know that, don't you?
You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
Company's not here, is it?
Which half?
What're you doin'?
SULEIMAN!
New Mecca....
Found somethin' worse than me, huh?
Well, you got the big gauge.
Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
So much for your nightfall.
To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
When are you going to show me what's in the cave?
Got your sensors?
Nothing will grow here .... there's just a trace of hydrocarbons, and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates.
But the quota system's been abolished! You made it. Why can't I?
The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.
That's true, Dr. Zaius. My witnesses -- correction -- my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater.
Did you see that? It's remarkable!
Well? Where are we? Have any notion, skipper?
Landon! Join the expedition.
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
All right --
Taylor.	I'm telling you --
What is that?
Why special?
Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
Sustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira, you must admit the accused is a nonape, and therefore has no rights under ape law.
With one of them.
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
What is your proposal?
Twelve hundred years ago.
You! ... You knew about this?
Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
Yes.
Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.
Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.
I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.
But there's the doll, sir.
But the proof? The doll?
Hey Taylor, you don't know it but I saved your ass today. I killed a shit-eating dog. 
Don babytalk him man. Cocksucker fell asleep. They walked right up on us, he don do shit.
Yeah but I still like a piece of pussy once in a while - ain't nothing like a piece of pussy cept maybe the Indie 500.
Taylor - get your ass over here. Move!
You guys trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head. 'Lias didn't ask you to fight his battles and if there's a Heaven - and god, I hope so - I know he's sitting up there drunk as a fuckin' monkey and smokin' shit cause HIS PAINS HE DONE LEFT DOWN HERE. Baaaaaaaaa! 
Hey Taylor, you okay man?
Dawn! That was it!
...I can't sleep, why don't you get some sack time.
...don't feel like it either.
...beautiful night.
Barnes got it in for you, don't he?
Do you believe that stuff about... knowing you're gonna die?
What you got there - beers?
I volunteered.
Must be somebody?
Not just me... it's the way the whole thing works. People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it! We just don't add up to dry shit.
Politics man, fuckin' politics. That O'Neill man got his nose so far up Top's ass he gotta be Pinocchio...
Sounds pretty far out to me 'Lias.
Whew! - where that come from?
Found it. Growing in a garden.
The Good Lord works his revenge in strange ways.
Right...
I'll make one for you.  I live there.
How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side.

Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.
Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash.
If you change your mind about the cocktail party, or anything else, give me a buzz.
Please be a little more careful how you talk, Mr. Mitchell.
How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr.  Campbell here?
Your liquor laws..
And do you amuse the guests?
No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff?
Neatly said...but to the wrong man. The trouble with pretty girls is that they can't imagine anyone thinking of anything else but the fact they are pretty girls. I get tired of it.
Dance? Tonight?
Certainly not to me.
That man over there. He was in the hotel lobby.
He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
It still doesn't matter if I kiss you?
Cant be too close for me.  Right across the street from it suits me.  Anything else listed?
If you meant it, you wouldn't show it to me, Betty.  Or am I supposed to deliver it to dear Inspector Killaine?
There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After you're gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me.
How bad is it?  Bad enough for-- 
Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.
This must have cost a fortune.
You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.
If you're doing all this just for me.
Funny, I never thought of you that way.  You were so close too.  We were all pretty stupid about you.
Including Killaine.
It buys things, just like any other kind.
It wasn't the time or place.  Don't worry about the note, baby.  I'm playing for my neck now.
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
I'm sorry, that's all there is.
Well, that's not getting us anywhere. You won't tell me who you are, or give any account of yourself. You won't even give me your address in the United States. Why? Unhappy marriage?
Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?
I'm sorry.
What this?
Where's you get it?
An unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that.
FLorida?
We wouldn't have met at all.
I wouldn't make you talk about it. My job is the death of Marry Mitchell.  Why can't you give me your confidence?
You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.
Palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the Taj Mahal by moonlight--roses in an English garden, just after a shower--  Clichs, one and all--but good ones, with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find.  Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?
Not sometimes.  Always.  Just because it is the hard way.  You're that kind of man, Jeff.
All right. Get him.
I'm still asking. What do you want?
Why not here?
Let me introduce you. Mr.  Killaine, Mrs. West.
And without much discrimination.
How are your teeth getting along?
How are you two getting along?
Could we discuss that some other time?
It could have been an accident.
And old man Clarendon?  He had a motive, too.  Margo and her money.
Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.
You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?
No more for me, thanks.  Remember what I said.  I can't interfere with the law.
You forgetting the gag line, Killaine.  The police don't take anything for granted.
Did I do something wrong?
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
Mr. Mitchell.
Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
So much less refined than frizzling them in the chair.
Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.
You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.
I've got a year.  Or a second. I'm not sure which.
We've done that.  He's a San Francisco private eye.  Name Martin J. Goble, G-O-B-L-E.  Had initials in his hat and for once he lived where he bought it.  Goble and Greer is the firm name.
If you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
Send that?
Go live in a tent.
You get it's brother.
She didn't seem the type to lam out--even if she got the chance. That stuff was all gone through last night.  Anything special you're looking for, Inspector?
Gigi, huh?  Sounds French--one of those fancy ladies.  Must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold.
You've got a dead man on your hands. You killed jim--even if it wasn't murder.  What are you going to do about it?
Do I know that she's out of the room?  Likely to be out of it for some time?
He could have tried.  If he was up there in the dark, listening, he'd know when she came home, know when she found Mitchell dead, know what she did about it.  If she telephoned, he'd probably hear that.
You win, Inspector.  You win all along the line.  Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake.
Remember that time, didn't I? Good morning Mrs. West.  Does your visit here mean you've changed your mind?
At first, it doesn't hurt at all. That's shock.  Then it hurts terribly--you wouldn't believe such pain could exist--and six months later you can't remember what pain felt like.  It hasn't taken six months this time.  It hasn't even taken twenty- four hours.  Is that a beastly thing to say?
It does.  May I go now? 
So far.
You'll have to take my word for it.  We don't make slides until we have perfect prints for comparison.
She's a suspect, naturally.  But not the only one.
I think you'd be entirely justified, sir.
I believe you won decorations during the war.
So-so.
What's this?
A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?
I'm sorry. I forgot about calling for you.
It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--
I see.  Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield?
It's fine, thank you.
History books are first onto the bonfires.
Now first of all, tell us your name.
Give them here.  This tells you how the Women's Peace Camp came to be set up.  All local women at first, then we had support from women and men all over the country.
But what we need is national coverage.  It's difficult with this Falklands madness going on. Do you think you might be able to do something when you get back?
...break away completely from--
I thought it was tremendous.
It makes me weepy just to remember it.  So we were fine again, and then she got married to Matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes TV commercials.  What about yours.
Why not stay?
I think she liked me.
Do you think she's invited you up for her sake or for mine?
I haven't seen much of you.
That'll be fun
Jeremy, just let me see what you've got.
She's never written a book in it, but she clearly knew a lot.
That's enough of that.
What have you been up to?
You're a piece of shit
Hello.
So how is she?
No.
Susan told me that your visits to Norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive.
It's because he desires you.  The women get all the breaks at these conferences.
I won't.  Goodnight.
You always talk like this?  You're not gonna start chanting or anything are you?
No.  So I was up the beach.  I saw it going down.  you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world.
Where?
I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here.
Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.
Don't screw around man, pull it!
One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!
We're wasting time.
I'm not armed.
Where's Roach?
And let my policy expire?  Sorry.
No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!
Yeah?  What?
All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
How was the beach?
They found the drop car up on Mulholland.  I want you two to go work it.
Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.
They don't go for the vault?
Oh well he must be a surfer.
Johnny, it's the only way.
Look, if you're gonna go leavin' your piece and your shield in the car, you can damn well stay in sight.  Okay?
Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?
This Zen master surfer.
Sure, he's "the Bodhisattva".
Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
Who cares!
Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
We're going to need everyone.
I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier.
You're looking well, Dutch.
What's that, General?
No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town?
Well... I might be going out to dinner.
I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
Please, we hardly know each other.
The real estate possibilities are endless.  Most of the yard we'll just level.  I talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said --
Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock.  On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours.
No.  What I have is a lot of money.
Stop.  For just a moment.  Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you a few questions <u>before</u> you sign. You realize that you're a target. If you weren't mine, you'd be someone elses, correct?
Quiet.  Would I get the loans?
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
Sit... and spin.
<u>Ho</u>tel.
It pays.
You really are a very beautiful girl.
I fucked the debate team in high school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays.  You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it?
What?
Never answer the phone.  Ever.
It's very tasteful.  I think you'll especially like the zipper in the crotch.  I'm -- joking.
No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
Television?
I have work to do.
What about dinner?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
Vivian...
But don't they have it in English?
What else?  You gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?
It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
Business.
It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.
It was good.
What's up, where you going?
Love this car!  Is it new?
Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia.  I'll see you in the office.  By the way, about your car...
What time's diner tonight?
I don't think there's any sense in --
What!?
I can't handle this tonight. I'm going home.
Kit!  Where've you been?
In Beverly Hills?
All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it.  I don't know what to do.  What do I do, Kit?
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
You bullshittin' me?
<u>Housekeeping</u>.  I come to turn down the bed.
That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely.
What is it, Miss Vivian?
Hmmm... I vonder vich. 
Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.
May I help you?
You have beautiful things.  How much is this?
I don't think it would fit you.
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
Yes?
Do you remember me?
May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.
I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-
I fear I'll never see you again.
But what if something happens to you?
We'll never survive.
We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here.
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?
But it did. I was there. This old man said, "Man and wife."
We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
And a good thing too.
Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed.
No more rhymes now, I mean it.
What do I do?
Hello.
-- where?
Have you any money?
I have a little.
Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that.  Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
Yeah. It's really good.
What is this? Are you trying to trick me? -- Where's the sports? -- Is this a kissing book?
-- well, when does it get good?
As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.
Rise and report.
Could this be a trap?
Now?
Where's Fezzik?
-- all that I have and more please --
I do not suppose you could speed things up?
Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.
Perhaps an arrangement can be reached.
I smell nothing.
You've made your decision then7
You guessed wrong.
Don't say another word, Valerie.
The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?
Guess what.
You are sick, that's why he's here.
Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt.
"I want to croon,
"To my honey I'll croon,
Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
Here, don't panic.
Yes, it's quite possible.
So what?  What did it get me?  I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
But what if the play was a hit?
No, Bloom, you don't understand. This is fate, this is destiny. There's no avoiding it.
I'm not going to jump on you!
It's a little better, but you still look angry.
Let me see ... it's such a beautiful day.  Why waste it indoors.  I've got it!  Let's go to Coney Island! We'll lunch at the sea shore.
What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island?
You think you're not in prison now? Living in a grey little room. Going to a grey little job.  Leading a grey little life.
You bet your boots, Leo.  It's Bialystock and Bloom -- on the rise. Upward and onward.  Say, you'll join me.  Nothing can stop us.
You can't feel it when it's in your hand, when it's in your pocket.
Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.
What is she gonna do here?
No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?
Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers are in order.  I love my country.  "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber vaves of grain."
I vas vit him a great deal, you know.
Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
You think out of all those Hitlers you could find just one...
Always.
Here.  You see.  This is the slow fuse.  It is much wider.  It has more resistance, more density. Therefore, it burns slower.
Vhy do you always call me kraut? Kraut is cabbage!  Do ve call you hot dogs?  Ve call you Yanks not franks!
Come on.  We'd better hurry.  We're late.
Call chauffeur.  Get car.
No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.
We can't play today?
Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
Smasheroo.  Smasheroo.
By the sacred memory...
Hindenburg...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
I mean in show business.
Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!
He's the only cat left that still grooves me.
Hey, baby, that's good!  How'd we come out?
We won.
She was tired. She said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... Yes, now I'm remembering very clearly because I'm picturing. When you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. She was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way.
What?
I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.
Anyone at home?
Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you?
I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.
Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...
Casharoonie!
I think you'd better give it a trial spin. Don't want any bad word of mouth about California Charlie.
I'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you, but...
Call her sister! If no one's answering at the house....
You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
Mary had been there, one night, and had left.
Can see you do. Sorry I couldn't make you feel better. You want to come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person... And the theft, is what you want to do!  Sooner you drop this thing in the lap of the law, that's the sooner you'll stand a chance of your sister bein' picked up. How about that?
Yes?
With you.
What's the matter?
And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?
A good reason, I suppose.
Maybe we can handle it together. 
Are we just going to go on sitting here?
Who's he?
I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.
How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
What?
When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy! 
We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!
Sam! No!
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
Thank you, Mr. Bates.
Uncommon, too.
I imagine so.
Alright. I'll see you in the morning. I'll bring you breakfast.  What time will you...
Very early. Dawn.
Please... I'd like to go...
In the course of my duty, I never "take up" anyone's time, whether it's to give a warning, or a ticket, or help! Believe that, M'am.  Now if you woke up on the wrong side of... the car seat, that's one thing. But when you act as if I've just placed you under arrest...
I'm not saying you shouldn't be contented here, I'm just doubting that you are. I think if you saw a chance to get out from under... you'd unload this place...
This place! This isn't 'a place.' It's my only world. I grew up in that house back there. I was a happy child. My mother and I... we were more than happy.
Shut up!
Leave me alone!
Mother, please...
And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
Was that all?
That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.
Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you.
Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
But where do the rats come in?
By the way, where <U>is</U> your assistant?
Oh, yes, he's in good hands now.
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
I'm going to call the police.
By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.
I don't agree with you.
I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.
I won't let you say that!
Well, that's just how stupid I am. When you go riding, it will be with me. And if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement.
That's the way I feel about it.
If you will forgive this poor, crippled stump, my dear, I am very happy to know you.
Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?
We'll be coming to the opening.
Not a very good one, I guess. He wasn't like anything human. He hobbled and swayed like a monkey, and the face, from the glimpse I got of it in the light from the street, was like an African war mask.
Charming. More delightful people crippled.
Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.
And it came to life and divorced you. I know all about that. Now my idea is this: Somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure ... Bingo! ... Peddles it to this old skate down there!
This one's a story, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. Every time I tell you anything it goes haywire.
Yes, sir. I got in the cab and it was layin' there on the floor.
Where were you going when you got in that cab?
You didn't happen to be going to Worth's place, did you?
He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
How much money have you got?
I came back for some of the books. I am trying to straighten out the accounts. I don't hope to impress you, but I may as well tell you: We haven't a farthing!
To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
If you leave before the work is done, you will be gone for a much longer period ... you will be gone for good.
I wouldn't feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight, Mr. Igor. The weather was against you, and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow.
Have you got it? Is it completed?
Yep. Everything settled.
They didn't have a leg to stand on. There's no case against me. It's a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about.
Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me  to this particular switching station?
No.  I didn't.   I'm listening.
Yes?
She must have gone out for a walk with the children.
I am in awe of it, Mother.
It's so terrible I can't tell you. Oh, Buddy, you don't know how it hurts to have a broken heart, what a terrible feeling it is, and I've had a broken heart so many times. Men, I don't understand them, I can't figure them out and they break my heart, that's all. I can't find Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find him no matter how hard I look, all I find is a whole pile of Mr. Wrongs. But this is the worst ever because it wasn't his fault. It was my fault, oh yes, my fault, I was bad -- oh God, I was bad, you wouldn't believe how bad I was.
No, you can't. And I'll tell you this -- he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can't fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me.
There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.
Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's all, I have a natural curiosity, it's only human. You're my friend, aren't you? Don't you like me?  I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact, I love you.
I'm thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh?
I got an awful toothache.
Rose, you are too uncritical of people.
He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?
Yeah, I'd believe it.
Neither do I.
He did lie, and... and... and Mother, yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook!
Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
Son, was Rose in your room last night?
See that, son? Now this is a heel, see, and there, that's the ball of a foot. Someone has been walking here.
Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?
I said ahhh-dam stuff.
Children, children! Be quiet, all of you!  The vibrations in this house are strange today. Where's Rose, anyhow?
She's getting herself up to go out.
Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this.
They're discussing it.
Now I can't see. What are they doing?
Buddy, that was pretty snotty of you, pushing me away like that just when it was interesting.
The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.
You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.
Well, you have knocked me for a hell of a loop, old man. A hell of a loop.
I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.
That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
First, about the girl's history. Evidently she's been very promiscuous since early childhood, she has no control over her sexual impulses. Furthermore, she is permanently barren, she can't have children.
Oh. Did you say something?
Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I don't understand these deeper things the way you do.
Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home.
Well, she's back.
Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
Excuse me, sir, are you calling my wife a liar?
She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go.
What did you forget?
Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
Why, that looks like Dave Wilkie,
You're so sweet.
Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
God forbid. You're not sick, Rose, forget it. Don't get any notions in your head, you're not sick.
I haven't had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big.
You're looking very chipper this morning, Rose. Sow do you feel?
Rose... I hate to be mean, but...  Oh, nevermind, forget it.
Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?
I see. Outside it.
Dave Schapiro is no horse doctor and Rose has been a good wife to him for a long time. To call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing I ever heard in my life.
Yeah, I'll do that, Dave.
What do you want me to tell her, Dave?
Well, Mrs. Hillyer, the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive. But not many people walk away from double pneumonia, Madam, not many.
Yes, go on.
She was raised on a poor dirt farm. I'm sure she's never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor.
Really, why don't you go sit down somewhere?
Rose, you're in an awful dither tonight. What's the matter with you, honey, are you sick or something?
Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
You see, Rose? Now that's the kind of dress you ought to wear.
I was offered that job as a waitress.
Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.
I'm looking at this poster, and I'm thinkin', I don't remember seeing films like this when I was in school.
How much?
Now you know what to watch for...
We'll take the CalTrust heist, but if it's no good, we will hunt you down, and Billy-Boy will pull out your spine and he will beat you to death with it.
What... ?
I say, fuck 'em.  Let's go.
We shoulda been there to back you up. We shoulda!
Clench your teeth.
The booze.
Name one.
Well, I would like to sit in front today.
You been wearing rubbers, Billy-Boy?
You know, the more weight back there, the faster the car goes.
"Leo.  The stages of the moon are in alignment, so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement.  Wash yourself more carefully each morning, stop using pies and cakes as your primary source of nourishment, and quit tucking your shirttails inside your underwear."
Smooth move, hot-shot.
Laugh it up.  You'll cry later.
Okay.  But, what changed our mind?
This is the police lock-up.  We're police.  How can we steal from ourselves?
Bad news is, word's spreading like wildfire that we don't have badges, and nobody wants to end up getting splattered like Butch Cassidy either.
Whoa, whoa... it's gonna be alright.
He tried to kill us.
Where have you been?
What happened, Kittle?  We used to be friends.  You used to know how the game was played.
I... I think I can... clarify...
Well... seeing how you just suspended me, what's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?
Yeah, non-believer?  Here's yours...  "Scorpio, October 24 to November 22: Jupiter is in conflict with Saturn, so proceed with caution..."
You know what I mean.
Slow down.
You think this is so easy?
What... ?  Not you too?
I can't believe I'm hearing this,
Let's get this thing done.
Alright, flesh-peddler, let's see empty hands!
Been waiting long?
You're... you're not doing what I think you're doing... ?
Do tell.
When you bunch it together, it's exponentially more powerful.  Two sticks have the power of four sticks. Four sticks have the power of sixteen, and so on.
You always did have style.
There's still good in him.
You cannot escape your destiny.
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!
Yes, my Master.
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
Are you all right?
Fine. Together again, huh?
Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Leia!
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
He wasn't. I can feel it.
Lower it!
Well, look at you, a general, huh?
Good luck.
We're coming!
There it is!
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
Your father?
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
You cannot hide forever, Luke.
Master Yoda, you can't die.
I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable.  Oh so soft.  So sensual.
Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
The future is ours so let's plan it.
Janet.
Yes.
I've got something to say.
Oh Brad, I'm mad.
What was that bang?
They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
I'm Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Vice.
No, don't do that.
I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.
Want to come again and stay
Oh my, my,
No no no no.
No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.
I thought you liked them.  They liked you.
Hey, how's my buddy doin'?  -- Nice dog -- Well, I'll see ya later.
...Guess.
Yes, I do.
Why?
What's the problem? You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it?
No, I don't belong here.
Don't you open them anymore?
Sharp -- Real nice.
Don't want weak legs.
Rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to.
...What?
What did you say about a pet shop?
Apollo?
Why?
I want 'im outta here --  Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo?  That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo!  You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs!  I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!
Too old, dull fighter.  Bobby Judge is a good boy.
Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit.
You're hurtin', man!
How was the flight, Champ?
That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
...No wine -- Bad for ya' brain.
Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
Why?
It ain't your fault -- I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight.  That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' I broke my hands on his head -- I lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think?
...How 'bout for the Cokes?
You could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means Champion Apollo Creed is heading towards the ring --
It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
I say ya nothin'!
That's it, I'm broke.
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio -- He's late three weeks. How'd you do last night?
Ya sure?
Hey, screw ya brain on right. Now, who's this girl you're going out with tonight?
You think I don't hear things?
Gonna try.
Black market?
Hello, Mr. Balboa -- I'm Miles Jergens -- Please, have a seat.
Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager?
Sparrin'?
I know ya need sparrin' partners -- I'm very available.
What?
How old?
Listen, I'm gonna take a steam -- Did good last night -- Shoulda seen it.
Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
Tie it to both ankles -- Leave two feet slack.
Wanna keep goin'?
It ain't your locker no more.
Yeah -- See the fight last night? Apollo Creed beat that English guy bad.
Bullmastiff.
Yo, Paulie.
Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister?
She's a loser -- She don't enjoy life -- She reads -- Brainy -- Pushin' thirty friggin' years old!  She's gonna die alone if she don't wise up.
I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
Maybe ya should see a doctor.
Ice skate.
Ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know.
How 'bout you talk to 'em about me?  Please do me that favor.
Ain't sure, what's the story?
Whatta these guys want?
Outta my house I want ya!!
I'll tear his head off.
Is it true the most you've ever made in a prizefight is five hundred dollars?
And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?
So where is it then?
Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
Come on, Doom.  What would a company like that want with Toontown?
That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
Why didn't you tell me?
So where is it?
Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli...
They say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin' the other day.
Doom.
Yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?
Have you got the will?
Valiant!  You surprised me.
Well, everybody needs a hobby.
You got the will in there, don't ya?
The habeus corpus is thickening.
I'll get it.
If I don't make it back here by ten...
Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night?
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
Good marrow, father!
That's my good son: but where hast thou been
I pray thee, chde me not; whom I love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow; the other did not so.
O, she new well. Thy love read by rote and could not spell. Come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove, to turn you household rachor to pure love.
Juliet!
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
Come gentle night. Come loving black-browned night give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, take him and cut him out into little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. O, I have bought the mansion of love but not possessed, and though I am sold, not yet enjoyed. O, tedious is this day, as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them.
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
Go! We follow thee. Juliet, Blah!
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
Peace, good Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing.
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
Meaning, to court'sy.
Right.
I thought all for the best.
What wouldst thou have with me?
Coordinate all you want, but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me.  Are we in sync on this, Vincent?
You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but you'll be dead before I hit the ground.
You call me with the target's route, I follow along until we've reached the attack point and then I run his squag ass off the road.
Now there's the Deirdre I know.
Well, if it isn't Mr. Interpol himself.  I can't believe I misjudged you like I did.
Where do you get off saying word one? All the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus and myself.  And here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us.
Are you alright?
It's quite satifactory.
That fucking figures...
Don't do it, Sam!
What do you mean?
So, you've got it all figured, do you?
Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.
Gregor, is that you?
There is one other thing...
Don't cross me...
I need you, Swede, I can't do this without you!
It gets done now or not at all.  Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them.
What a surprise...
They call me Swede.
I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds.
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
Where is this broad?
I didn't know that you spoke French.
I do.
Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable.
Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
What's going on?
I saw you look off when Francois nodded his head.  I figured he wasn't pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and the rest was easy.
It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
I'm going with you.
This doesn't involve you, don't you understand?  I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.
Alright, it's done.
You know him?
Do what?
Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.
You were behind the door?
You think?
Business keeps you on the road?
Why not?
Finish the job...
You speak French.
I know.
You sure?
Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.
A friend.  I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
I should kill you right here! I never thought you'd do this to me but I guess there's a lot I didn't know about you!
Robbed a bank, c'mon!  Don't you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit I don't know how many were at large!  Don't you think there would be a bulletin?  This is a big ass drug deal!
Why?
What are you gonna do?
Okay then.  I'll do it.
That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us.
Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note	or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's just a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
And how do you figure we do that?
He's going to be trouble.
If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
You killed him...
Maybe we should say somethin'.
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
And you're solid on that?
You gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies.
All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
Shut up, Jesse.
Yeah I'm fine.
Sally?  I was beginning to think he wasn't gonna leave.
Like hell it's over.  You told me he wasn't doing this anymore.
Don't worry the real men are in charge now.
Why would someone do that?
Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
Just goes to show you.
Jesse?
Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.
Nice of you to join us.  I did say three o'clock, didn't I?
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
I didn't say that.  You did.
Don't you want to hear about my day?
Yeah let's hear about your day.
Dwayne -
I was in the neighborhood.
I tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent.
Are you hungry?
And not just any air conditioner. This baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail.
Anything in it?
That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?
He didn't make it into work, and he's not home.
Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.
Winner!  Four, winner!
Wait.
Is this about the funny money?
So tell me what you know.
I don't want to play games with you, Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes.
You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.
Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
No.  It's my first time.
All I did was invite them for a drink.
No.
I'm sorry.
She said I could pick any girl I want.
What's wrong?
Who?
What, leave you alone so he can cap you?
Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.
What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case.
Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.
I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?
Is it hot in here?
I'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice.  You want some ice?
Gimme the binoculars.
I don't want to hear this.
Pick it up!
Get it out of here!
Let me see it again?
Look, man I'm sorry.  I know you got a thing for her.
I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you.
What's a Chinese heaven?
If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
Mind your own business.
That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
Who's Benjamin?
I'll go to the craps table, make a big scene.  When security comes over, you make your move.
Lee!
Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?
No you didn't!
About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.
This money is evidence.
I could use a little vacation.
The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.
Any leads?
We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.
The police can protect you.
He was the best I ever trained, you know.
I know, Master, but...
Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --
Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
Who the hell is that?
You know what a phone booth is?!
Feds asked for me?
He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a bitch.
You have one of these?
It's the same thing!
Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  You seemed as if you liked to talk.  I like to let people talk who like to talk.  It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
You're a regular god damn acrobat, aren't you?  Bet you feel real good makin' me look like an asshole.
I know a shortcut.
You make the plate?
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
Alright, listen, no bullshit just tell me straight: did you really know the guy you were chasin'?
You know War?
That's not how it goes.
What?!
Like that.
What?
You don't like it?
Yeah. So why you look do down?
How much they want?
Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...
I am not an American, Mr. Russ.  My daughter is not an American.
Ahh.
See you at the wedding.
At this pace, it could be an evening wedding.
Really?
I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question.  The rest weren't so bad.
I'll get the dress.
Don't be nervous, Maggie.  Let us visualize.  Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball."
Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.
I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
Lawyers.  I don't know, Ellie -- Firing me is going to be very tough on you.  It's going to be hard to get over.  There will be therapy bills for you.
Look, he's running after her.
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
Don't say "spec" like it's a dirty word. Nobody ever paid Shakespeare to write a play!  Plato never got a book advance...
This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.
Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"?
Well, wedding cake freezes.  This we know.
Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee operation, Grandma's birthday...
Originality is my speciality.
Five hundred.
It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in.
I think so.
Always a mood killer.
I already explained about that.
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
What happened at the luau?
Grandma!
You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.
Let's go.
I'm just finishing up, too.
Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
No.  It's my life.
A harmless joke.
No.
There's no why, Annie.  I'm just not up for it.  I never said I was.
You take the microwave?
Tell me he's living in squalor. Tell me everything he has is being repossessed, including his filthy, dented mobile home.
Your Uncle Milton lost all his money in a Puerto Rican condominium that went belly up, don't mention the IRS or the Federal prison system.  Your mother is Barbara, your father is Cliff --
I love you.
Even when you were young?
We will?  The Symphony?  Okay.  I'll take you to the Russian Tea Room for pelmeni.
I don't know what to say about it, Walter.  It was a form of temporary insanity.  But I had to tell you about it because --
-- it was a betrayal.
You okay?
About what?
... movie.  That's your problem.  You don't want to be in love.  You want to be in love in a movie.  Read it to me.
He lost all the weight... there.
Hello.
What?
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
This is a photo of hair.
So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
Maybe you should see a shrink.
Perfect.  Sandbag the father.
Are you Annie?
I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
The Historical Society wanted this and I never would give it to them --
I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.
It's silly, really.  I mean, I'd seen him at the office, obviously I'd seen him, he's the associate publisher, and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place, and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat, which of course he was allergic to, and I got his lettuce and tomato on white.
Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
So you'll get married in a new dress.
You touch her for the first time, and suddenly... you're home.  It's almost like...
I don't think I could really describe it.
No last names, Jonah.  Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers.  How come you're up so late?
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
I have no doubt that you're a good dad.  You can tell a lot from a person's voice.  But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud.
Hey, my plate is full.
I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.
I don't know.  Do I?
What is it?
Oh, you're changing your mind --
I'm sorry.  I'm just --
I'm not going to think about what they're not teaching you in school.  I am not going to think about it.  Generally speaking I think we should rule out people who don't live somewhere near here --
Whose show was this on?
It was sinking.
Is that what she used to sing?
Who is Annie?
I have to have a life.  I have to do things that I want with people my own age.  It's none of your business who I am going out with.  I don't give a good goddam if you're angry --
You said we could go to New York.
I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
We live two piers over, don't we? Number 12, right? We're having like a really neat open house today from like four to whenever if you care to stop by.
How's Jonah taking it?
Hi.
We can't finish the job.  She's on her sixth painter, now she's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked --
I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
Got any more ideas?
How goes it?
You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
There's Jenkins' wife. You don't see her on no picket line.
How do you feel?
A meeting?
Sun up.
No, you don't. Have you learned nothing from this strike? Why are you afraid to have me at your side? Do you still think you can have dignity only if I have none?
You talk of dignity? After what you've been doing?
Whose neck shall I stand on, to make me feel superior? And what will I get out of it? I don't want anything lower than I am. I'm low enough already. I want to rise. And push everything up with me as I go ...
You know I don't think that.
The what!
Ramn ... listen to me ... I'm in a	jam ... I had to get a job ...
Are you Australian?
Ride 'em cowboy)
Now that's down-right insulting.
How?
This man sounds like a real catch.
Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?
I can't.
Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.
What happened to your eye?
Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?
Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.
He knows where I work.
Will you do that?  Then I want you to get out of the room.
I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.
Who is it?
Maybe I am dealing with it.
Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
How the hell did we get this detail?
Nice day
You don't say.
That's a good one.
Don't get carried away.
I'm getting a 10% finder's fee from my man if I can get the right price.
Nah... I want to keep it.  Maybe I can use it for like, inspiration ...you know...like when I detox?
Not bad.
Can we talk price?
You're serious?
Come on, guys ...
Now get talkin'
Bobby, rhymes with hobby.
No last name?
Don't you wonder why I do it?
Look, we'll talk to the A.D.A.
Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
That's because he doesn't have one.
Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there?
Who'd have thought it?  Danny "Chickenshit" Flynne trying to go large right under our noses.
Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood.
There's no motels around here.
Tom, quit fucking around.
She's 57 and she's been teaching third grade for the last 33 years.
We're in business.
Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team.
Report.
In West Fork?
That must be four thousand yards.
Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
Captain, my feet are most uncomfortable.  If I'd 'a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to Ramelle, I never would 'a volunteered for this here mission.
You didn't volunteer, Jackson.
You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
I'm in my backyard, lying in my hammock, with my arm around my wife, listening for the sound of breaking glass.
No white-walls, sir, there's a war on.  NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE!  I can't help you, sir.
But you could have gotten killed and I...
I've been humming it.
It seemed appropriate.
Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET!
I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.
Hell of a mission.
Since when have things been normal?
You got me.  Afraid of bad news?
They guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up.
A couple of weeks.  It started in Portsmouth when they brought us down for loading.
SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.
Yeah.
No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?
Except this time, the mission IS a man.
Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.
What are we going to do?
Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here?
No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?
Jesus Christ, he's a natural!
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.
I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
Maybe.  But what if he dies on the way back?  you see what I'm saying, sir?  The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division.
No, sir.
Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us.
HERE THEY COME!
Goddamn it!
Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.
Is jumped on by one.  Upham FIRES. KILLS the German.
Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee, he was going to be a preacher, his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch Hudson.
Shit, sir.
Who cares?
So, where are you from?
Mr Court, be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates...
Hmmm.  Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.
Hi.
Good for her.
Because it's loud enough so the neighbors don't complain, that's how come I know.
Yeah.
That's not even a scam.
What's a scam?
I'm gonna call her.
C'mon Lloyd.
The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.
Look at his face, he did the deed.
Hey, I know this is a strange thing to say, but maybe Diane Court really likes Lloyd.
One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
Confirm this with my office and my client.
I'll put this past my boss
Oh no, no, it's... it's wonderful.   It's... no, don't worry about it.  You're very funny.  Go back, that's great!
You won it.  You're going to study at the finest institute at England, the toughest fellowship in the country, and you won.
Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?
She's not the world's greatest flyer, let me tell you.  When she was eight years old, she...
So anyway, they closed the doors, and she starts to scream.  I've never in my life heard anyone scream quite like that.
I was irresponsible, I should have called.
You bet you should have called.  You still live at home.  Don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.
Lloyd?
Bon voyage.
Honey!
Why are you being so hateful to me?  Is this because of Lloyd?
That's right, work it out.
If we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier.  You know, your room is always ready for you, you can always come home if... alright, what do you want me to do?
Yeah.  I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back.
Oh, thanks, but I'm busy.
Yes.  Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
Actually, I think that I...
Whoa.
Keymaster?
Have a good sleep.
Sure I do.
Won't you see me later?
Okay, bye, I will.
You have to meet Bess.
Be friends?
Yes.  Are you shaking?
No.
Then why are you shaking?
Check your mail tomorrow.  I sent you a letter, a letter.
No, we don't have to say it.
Okay, how much time do you need?  I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions. 
I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.
Yeah you do.
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
Lloyd, I love you, okay?
How's it going?
No.  You just described every great success story.  Alright, it's alright.
YEAH!
Why don't I just get your phone number, that's usually how it works.
Okay, I'll give here the message.
Yeah, she is.  Good luck.
She wouldn't get out of the car.  I brought her all the way here, she said she was going to come here, and she wouldn't get out of the car.  But I thought that is was important, that she come to see you, because I know that if you go somewhere and you don't deal with your family stuff, then you're just gonna, she's gonna, um...
Are you going to England with her Lloyd?
She's very successful.
I know
"You can't know the horrible disappointment I feel..."
I know this part, keep reading.
Mike Cameron, how you doing?
I'm Lloyd Dobler.
You know Diane Court?
I was gonna...
Certainly.
You know what, you'd like her.
Do you have any idea what's involved? The paperwork alone?  Forget you got to build it all, getting the fucking permits, that's enough to drive you crazy.  Then the engineers show up.  They stand around and they argue about drainage - I'm telling you, you'll want to shoot somebody, I've been through it, I know.
It's true.  Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much.
When?
I just told you.
Yeah, all right, don't tell me, I'll go along with it, it's just irritating to me I can't figure it out.
How you feeling, all right?
What's wrong with it?
Oskar, good of you to come.
What others?
I was just the accountant.
Any reason to think next month will be worse?
You try to be fair to people, they walk out the door;  I've never understood that.  What's next?
This, I don't know, maybe you can trade it for something.
I got to go, I'll see you.
I lost a day of production.  I lost a worker.  I expect to be compensated.
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?
What's he done that's so bad - take money? That's a crime?  Come on, what are we here for, to fight a war?  We're here to make money, all of us.
Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action.
I just thought if I saw you face to face, maybe it would help.
You know the story, Gale. Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive?
I took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year.
I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.
Let us decide that.
Go on, untie him.
Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel?
I really dont like that comparison, honey.
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
I never meant to imply...
I think you're all an act.
You broke my heart.
The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Who are you?
I don't play games.
It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
Sid, I'll come with you.
Where is your attacker?
I dont know.
Shut up. Mickey, you and I can take her late evening.
"If I should stay. I would only be in your way. So I'll go. And yet, I know, I'll think of you each step of the way...
Knock yourself out.
Gotta.
A patio chair comes flying through a glass door. The young girl in the movie tears off running, SCREAMING, flying through the room.
Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again...knife raised.
You're not allowed to ask that.
Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
Do you want to die?
Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.
Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly,  Eight thirty.
Really? You're such a talented actor.
I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?
Nope.
Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?
In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.
Excuse me?
Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid. I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware	of last night's Events?
Is that a threat, Detective?
And what made you think it was Sidney?
What are you doing here? I told you to stay hidden! It's not safe for you up here.
Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
Don't worry, I've got a permit for it.
They've got her!
Dewey my God I thought you were dead.
It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I could've been the next Diane Sawyer!
What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
Do you have her number stored in your memory?  Phone memory!
Sidney, what happened?
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
Your life?
Who's phone?
Geez.
I am Gale Weathers!
Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
Gale Weathers. What a surprise.
You're not happy with your part.
Roman and everybody else went home for the night. I'm here for a make-up test.
You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.
Alright I'm here, now show your  face so we can finish this.
Hello?
Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!
No I need to call you. Just you.
How'd you do?
Dude. What are you doing here?
Ready?
I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.
Close call.
Jesus, SHIT!
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
I wanna let go. I do...
Who did you call?
When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
I don't understand...
So why did you dial it again?
I want to talk to you for a second.
Why don't you want to talk to me?
Just some scary movie.
Guess.
That's not what you said.
I have to go now.
I'm getting scared.
How do you know his name?
Where are you?
Please don't hurt him.
No...
NOOO!
No... please.
It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.
Evening, ma'am.
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
So is Dewey your real name?
I like it. It's... sexy.
Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.
Sidney's father?
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
Does mom know?
At the airport.
I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.
Should I be worried?
Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed.
Casey! Casey!
Has his story changed?
That was an ice pick -- not exactly the same.
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho.
Yeah, okay... whatever.
You're crazy -- both of you.
Do you believe this shit?
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
Just another sleepover at the Riley's.
This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.
This could be good. What do you think, Sid?
So you think my mom was a slut too?
If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
Is Billy going to be there tonight?
Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax.
Grant Goodeve -- the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman.
I thought you dumped her for me.
With that set of lungs -- she should be.
... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.
Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there?
I have no understanding of this place anymore.
You know that's not true.
You can't see the whole... the whole complete act yet.  Not yet.  But, when this is done, it's going to be... so... so...
You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions.
You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off.  That's all.
Murderers?
A woman...
Murderers like you?
And, why is that?
We would have gotten you eventually.
You've made a good life for yourself...
All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there.  I don't know.  Look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each other in the balls.  But, you're calling the shots, Lieutenant, so... however you want it to go.
There's a bucket here.
Is there any blood in it?
Okay... sure...  It's just that, with my old partner, you know...
It's too soon for him.
I'd like you to meet Somerset.
You go to movies at least?
I read.  Remember reading?
You've never seen "The Odd Couple?"  This is sick.  "The Honeymooners?!"
Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up.  Gould must have been working late.
He must have left another puzzle piece.
And, if it's a threat.
What if it's not that she's seen something?  What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?
Bullshit.
The way this has gone till now, I wouldn't have thought it was possible, but we may have underestimated this guy.
Sorry about that... I just...
Victor's landlord says an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox each month.  He says, quote, "I never heard a single complaint from the tenant in apartment three-o-one, and nobody ever complained about him.  He's the best tenant I've ever had.
It's a fine line between insane and inspired.
Yeah, well... at least we're out of the office.  We've got pizza.
I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.
You're sure you're reading that right? John Doe?
You do the talking.  Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.
Are you alright?
It was him.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
What are you talking about?
No dates indicated, placed on the shelves in no discernible order.  It's just his mind poured out on paper.  I don't think it's going to give us any specifics.
Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.
Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right?  No one's worthy of you.
Wrong!  I sympathize completely, because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you... you become like John Doe.  It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it, because it takes so much work to love.  You just have to make sure you don't stop to think about the abuse, and the damage, because you'll risk being sad.  Keep ignoring.
Throw your gun down now!
Tell me it's not true.
What?
It's nice to meet you.  My husband has told me a lot about you... except your first name.
It smells good.
You have a strange way about you... I mean interesting.  I'm sorry.  It's really none of my business.  It's just nice to meet a man who talks like that.  If David saw that paper, he'd say you're a fag.  That's how he is.
I was close once.  It just didn't happen.
I feel strange being here with you... without David knowing.
Crime of passion.
Not tonight...Ben, put that sword back.
Why'd they break off?  Was there water in that canyon?
Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?
You got any more orders, Captain?
How'd you come by this?
That's what I said.
Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.
You all right, Ethan?
Say!...What happened to your blanket? Lose it?
What you goin' to do?
Good night...Laurie...
Futterman?
How? She's even forgot her own language!
I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...
There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
Why it's just a snip of calico...
The <U>late</U> Mister Futterman?
You talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid...
Might at least have left me my pants!
Take it and welcome...but don't count on finding me here when you get back...I've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you...I ain't cut out to be an old maid!
No, it wasn't...You mighta said you loved me...You mighta asked me to wait...At least that'd have been something...
But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...
Don't cry, Laurie...I understand how it is...I'll just go 'way...
Ellen, move aside...
Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times.  And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
Don't tell me you've made friends with that wandering flea circus?
Where have you been all day?
Maybe an animal.
You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be.
Oh, Ellen!  I've been wondering when you'd come.  Why don't you step in.
It all went so fast.  He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  I only wanted to defend myself.  You have to call the police...
I think it's starting again. You know... there was something peculiar.  If only I knew...
Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
You have the last act?
Tomorrow.
How long has it been?
Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.
I have a wonderful new play!
What's the title?
Of course not!
How?
Where is the play?
Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!
it will be all right, madam.
It is all locked safe in here
She is always Aphrodite.
Nobody. The author.
It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.
Juliet? You mean Ethel.
Another little problem.
"But new struck nine."
Not ready? Where is she?
Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
Your Majesty
Speak out! I know who I am. Do you love stories of kings and queens? Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?
I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
As stories must when love's denied--with tears and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder.
"I know not."
"All my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay, And follow thee my lord throughout the world."
I have lost my gift.
Will!
"O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
As any mule in Christendom. But if you are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag.
Like you, I found him not at home!
Who are you, master?
The same, alas.
And that was only my first try.
No, the morning rooster woke me.
Mr. Henslowe?
Oh--no, no!
Oh, but it will end well for love?
You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.
"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
How does it?
My lord.
No. I have spoken to the Queen.  Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
The Queen has consented?
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
He is dead?
She tells me to keep away. She is to marry Lord Wessex. What should I do?
Like a sickness and its cure together.
Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy!
But what of Lord Wessex?
By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name?
I was trying to educate you.
I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to know: I wasn't trying to win.
You mean immoral.
Dig the pit, I don't know.
No, not that.
You know what. Who's going to do it.
I don't hear this.
I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.
Nothing.
Yeah?
It's very kind of you to offer, but --
I don't know anything about it.
But there's no --
Well, then?
Well, is it?
Sorry to waste your time.
Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
I thought you stopped going.
She hated you --
-- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
David?
Yes.
Alex.
Don't look?
Love and happiness for ever.
Cameron. You remember Cameron.
You know, you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it. That's my advice.
We have to talk.
No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further.
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
I see.
You mean I can have the room?
Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
Two hundred pounds?
That's what it cost, David.
No.
What?
Eh --
Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done.
What's it about?
Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
It was some guy called Brian.
Did he sound upset?
No. But he needs treatment.
A certain weakness.
Take all the time you like, doctor.
Yes.
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
Sorry?
I don't know, I think...
Maybe he's just a kooky guy who likes doing something kooky like that.
You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
That you were just indulging me.
-- I hope you like Miss Shawn --
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
-- is that right?
Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him.
She's got a...
I know.
It turned out to be cancer.
I don't want to talk about it...
Nummers.
George --
Whatever you say.
The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.
Is she all right?
Holy Christ. You want to get us killed?
... what?...
She's out, but you're supposed to wait.
No thanks.
Don't make conversation with me.
What?
You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
Yeah...
Jesus, look at this. Nine, nine and three quarters -- that's our prime rate. And I'll tell you something else: the big boys are going for it.
Well, I do Barbara Rush.
You're late, George.
Probably the bathroom.
Yeah, I think so...
Okay... but I want you to know one thing.  I've got to look great tonight, I mean I have to look great, okay?
Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
Yeah?
You did, I know you did.
-- we can't now.
You were great.
-- oh I thought you were --
-- what?
-- we are?
-- Jesus --
No --
Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him.
I can't just let him stand by the door...
Don't leave me...
She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.
That boy always does great. He's a corporal or a squad leader or something, just wrote me from some place called Kwang Due?
Jackie Shawn.
Not yet.
What's gonna happen?
Keep moving --
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.
I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.
I am?
Do you really mean that?
Yeah, baby.
Yeah.
Okay...  Night, baby.
George.
When is that, George?
A friend dropped me off.
What business meeting?
Look at the way I live.
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
Television or movies?
Where did this come from?
I just want to know, that's all.
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
Please!... that's not like you.
George...
No?
They're not?
Felicia's really interested in the shop, isn't she?
It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
This really ought to be layered...
Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
I wanna hear about it.
I wanna hear about it.
... yes, I follow your thinking on that.
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
What?
What took you so long?
No.
I was too old.
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.  Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy.
Then you were talking to him.
Aren't you going to have one?
Poster-Kleiser.
Fine.
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
Five times a day?
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
Well, you know what I mean.
What?
-- uhh-huhh...
Well he's not exactly a friend.
Johnny!
Good for you.
-- what's the problem, honey?
What did you say your name was, sweetheart?
Gee... that's wonderful, Jill.
Thank you.
No... how long did you say?
No.
Where to, Les?
There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times.  They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.  They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
What?
You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you?
No, Dad.
Tony.
Yes.
Maybe he showed me something.
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
Danny?
What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?
Talking to Tony.
Is Tony one of your animals?
Now I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day.  Okay?
Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.  I have a wife and eh two daughters, sir.
Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
She eh... interferes.
I did?
It's good to be back, Lloyd.
Well, something'll come.  It's just a matter of settling back into the habit of writing every day.
It's really nice up here, isn't it?
Okay.  I understand.  I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.
or whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when I am in here that means that I am working - that means don't come in.  Now do you think you can handle that?
Yes, I did.
Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?
I'm not going to hurt you.
Wendy give me the bat.
Physically, it's not a very demanding job.  The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation.
Good.  Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen.  Is your family having a look around?
Hi.
By five o'clock tonight, you'll never know anybody was ever here.
What time does the plane leave?
Bill, would you have the Torrances' things brought in their apartment.
Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!
Blue. This blue.
Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
Rats...
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?
Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up.
Was it a prescription?
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
No... but I found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove.
There! You see!
It could have been anything, Marty.
You're not going to let it go, are you?
No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it.
The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
I come here because Marty needs a friend.
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
'Cause we love it so damn much.  And cause we gotta come here.  Probation.
What did who say?
Oh, girls.
Yes, Betty?
The minute I saw you. I said to myself, she's a weaver.  Have you ever used a loom?
Amateurs 2
What?
Mary Clarence!
Experience!  Right?
What was all that?  Who was that man? Why would he shoot at us?
It's true!
Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.
This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams.
It never solves anything.
Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself.
And what next?  Popcorn?  Curtain calls? This is not a theater.  or a casino.
Please let me try.  I'm begging you.
Really.  Well, that makes two of us.
You and I know that life is not so simple.  There will be disappointments. Rude shocks.  And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.
Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.
I don't think so.  What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?
What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.
Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune?  Let me spell it out for you.  You have to hide like you don't even exist.  You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.
Okay -- no limo.
What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
But Vince has contacts all over the place!  This is San Francisco!  They'll be looking for me!
Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
I know that.  This isn't about me.  It's about the choir.  You should hear them. They're good.  Really good.  And I taught them.
Really?  Lieutenant?
I've got to go.
Really.
I'm sorry -- I don't know what gets into him.
It's a bluff, Vince.
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
What's she doing?
We've got to save her!
She told us about one.  The Little Sisters of the Moonlight.  In Las Vegas.
Is this like your old convent?
Mary Clarence!  Sister!
It's so beautiful...
Calm down.  Think clearly.  Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were?
Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.
And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.
Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother.  The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation.
I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset.
If we could speak alone.
Many have.
Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side.
You must have missed your mark.
What are you spying on?
Do you have these persons' wills?
I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.
The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants.  And the Widow Windsor was next...
Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
My talisman.  It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If I run in fear, it is worthless.
Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
What is it?
There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone.
It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
Lady Van Tassel...
What can we do?
Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of...
Other people?
Oh, you are hopeless.  May I keep it at least?
No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
No.  She has gone out.
It appears well.  It has already clotted.
Van Ripper.  Can you show where the body lay?
The Lenape who lived in these woods... do you know him?  The Redman?  I should tell you... he has been murdered.
Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love.
Go home.
She did not do it... please listen...
There was these two old boys hung their peckers off of a bridge to piss, one old boy from California and one old boy from Arkansas. Old boy from California says, "Boy this water's cold." Old boy from Arkansas says "Yeah, and it's deep too."  Get it? That's a goodun.
We order from Dairy Queen at noontime usually. We can buy your lunch till you get on your feet a little.
Yeah, they's good all right.
That boy wants me to.
Can I see him?
Sixty for small and seventy-five for large.
My name is Frank Wheatley. What's your name?
... on the third day I washed her. She wasn't very clean. I got all the right spots. She was the first one I ever kept for any length of time, you see I get bored easily, I have a short attention span. I can't say she enjoyed her stay, although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum. I don't really like people who talk a lot. I like to do the talking. I guess that's why I'm so fond of you. You're so easygoing, although I do sense a little tension in you sometimes. By the way, how was it out there? Did you have any fun? Make any new acquaintances? Tell me what it was like.
Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
Yeah.
You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet.  Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend? I thought he was comin' by here for something.
Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.
What?
What in the goddamn hell are you doin'? It's the middle of the night.
How'd your baptizin' go?
I know Albert. We're friends.
Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
You believe in the Bible?
I want to be baptized.
Don't hit that boy no more.
But maybe just for awhile --
Why'd you live there?
Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?
Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that.
Where'd you get them flowers?
Yeah, I recollect it.
Oh, jackin' off?
He ain't no count.
Why not? It died?
So it died when it come out?
Yes sir. Right then it was.
I've studied about it. The Bible says not to or you end up goin' to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.
Is that right?
I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen you over there follerin' me.
It don't matter to me about us losin' does it to you?
I'm glad of it you was borned.  I reckon I ain't gonna be there in the garage no more.
You have to Karl. You have to look out for me. You don't let that son of a bitch run you off.
Man. Thanks.  You know when you get a feelin' and you don't know why?
Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?
How come Karl won't eat here with us?
What are you doin' up again, Frank? You need to get a little sleep.
Yes ma'am, I reckon.
A blister shore can hurt.
I ain't got nothing but them books.
I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?
Tolerable, I reckon.
You scared me.
Mustard's good on 'em to me.
I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.
Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.
Hit ain't right for me to keep from tellin' you how come me to be put in the state hospital.
You're a hell of a boy, Frank. Someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that?
Ma'am?
What brings you back?
Did you knock on the door yet?
Quite a spell, I reckon.
Okay, Karl, the reason I brought you here was to talk to you about something that is on my mind.  I guess I'll put it right out on the table. Where do I start. Linda and Frank are very important to me. They're like family. My own family was never like family. They're horrible people. As a matter of fact I prayed every night for years that my father would die. I finally realized through a lot of therapy that I was wasting my energy on hating him. Now I just don't care.  You see, you and I are a lot alike, strange as that may seem. I mean not physically or even mentally really, just well, maybe emotionally or actually the hand we've been dealt in life. We're different. People see us as being different anyway. You're -- well you have your affliction or whatever and I, well mine's not as easy to see. I'm just going to say it. I'm gay.  Does that surprise you?  That I'm gay. You know what being gay is, don't you?
Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
Karl, what are you doing here? Come in.
Okay.
Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt them, has he?
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
You see, Karl, growing up, only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it. He couldn't really read but, well, neither could his mother. But, his father made sure that his mother knew what the Bible said. And she made sure Karl knew. You know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed, right?
His mother told him that he was their punishment. Hers and his father's; from God, for having sex--
That's really strange. What does it mean?
He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.
We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.
I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
I finished my story. I thought you might want to take a look at it.
Are you closed?
They're all the same.
It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.
It's kind of overwhelming.
What do you mean?
They're all the same, but each one is different from every other one. You've got your bright mornings and your dark mornings. You've got your summer light and your autumn light. You've got your weekdays and your weekends. You've got your people in overcoats and galoshes, and you've got your people in shorts and T-shirts. Sometimes the same people, sometimes different ones. And sometimes the different ones become the same, and the same ones disappear. The earth revolves around the sun, and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle.
Slow down, huh?
Nice machine, Auggie. Where'd you find it?
That's a feather in your cap, man. The paper of record.
Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
Is that all? I thought it was about three hundred.
You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
Get in, Auggie. I've got something to show you.
And what's that supposed to mean?
Jesus Christ. This is all I need.
Still, you can't just write her off.
Why don't you open it and find out?
Okay. I think everything's set.  You've got the number for Cape Cod, right? Just in case something goes wrong.
Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out.
A little. Not much.
Sure, Auggie. I follow. When you don't know nothing, it's like paradise. I know what that is. It's after you're dead and you go up to heaven and sit with the angels.
Of course it hurts. What does it look like?
Is your name Paul Benjamin?
I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas.
He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.
No thank you.
His father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. Louisa was Henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. Four or five years go by, and then one day Cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to tear Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. They're both big men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. I guarantee it ... So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. And the poor girl never came back.
It'll cost you five bucks.
And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
Hi there, little brother.
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
I just happened to be there.  The right place at the right time.
I don't drink coffee.  On the other hand, since you insist, if you offered me a cold lemonade. I wouldn't say no.
Good. Lemonade it is.  I'm Paul.
Are you sure you don't want some food to go along with it? It might help to absorb some of that liquid. You don't want to slosh around too much when you stand up.
Yeah, that's right.
I'm not "people." I'm just me. And I do whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it?
Nice drawing. Did you do that?
Eight-thirty.
Eight-thirty?
Cut it out, will you? Just cut it out and come back here.
Okay, okay.  It's all so stupid.  There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that's what people call him. The kind of guy you don't want to cross paths with.
I just happened to be walking by... All of a sudden, the Creeper and this other guy come running out of this check-cashing place with masks on their faces and guns in their hands... They just about ran smack into me. The Creeper recognized me, and I knew he knew I recognized him... If the guy from the check-cashing place hadn't rushed out then screaming bloody murder, he would have shot me. I'm telling you, the Creeper would have shot me right there on the sidewalk. But the noise distracted him, and when he turned around to see what was happening, I took off... One more second, and I would have been dead.
I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.
I just did.
Yeah, it might be.
I suppose so. He never told me about it.
No wonder he was angry.
Hi, kid.
If you're lucky.  Then again, it depends on what you call living. 
Yes, please.
That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.
Now, Mister Gi...
So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense?
Thank you, Mr. Gillanders.  Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.
Of course not.  We're just not quick to run and boast.  In case something went wrong.
The best part was that there was a 'this'.  To debate the wrongness of.
I couldn't say anything.  I just stood there, hating her.
And your evaluation of the defendant?  Could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff? So quickly, there would be no sign of struggle?
From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
And the last...?
You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
Maybe it went.  Where Carl went. Over the side.
<u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?
As my wife testified, we were considering it.
I should have told everything right away.  I know that now, and I regret it.
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely.  We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.
Naw, I had that around for a while.
He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.
Is it possible?
Are you absol...
He had no reason to.
Sorry about that, Mrs. Heine. Shall I repeat the ques...
The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...
I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
Are these your bags?
Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
Aren't you a little too young for that, sonny?
Which of you dolls is Daphne?
Yes, Sue?  What is it?
I beg your pardon.
- so the one-legged jockey said - 
Me and Tiny, we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle.
What are you worried about?  This job is going to last a long time.
I thought you weren't talking to me.
Yeah - where were you?
With you.
No.  And he ain't been eating so good, either. He's got an empty stomach and it's gone to his head.
But, Joe - three weeks in Florida!  We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
It's a hundred miles, Joe - it's snowing - how are we going to get there?
We could've had three weeks in Florida - all expenses paid.  Lying around in the sun - palm trees - frying fish...
DAPHNE?
This way, Daphne.
Well, now you know how the other half lives.
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar.
He's going to be ashore with you.
That's right.
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
Osgood proposed to me.  We're planning a June wedding.
Jerry, you'd better lie down. You're not doing well.
Look, stop treating me like a child. I'm not stupid.  I know there's a problem.
Jerry - there's another problem.
Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?
Not that, you idiot.
Telephone call?  Who's got time for that?
Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
All right - so what do we do now?
Did you hear that?
Elope?  But there are laws - conventions -
Terribly sorry.
Interesting.
No, no.
You all right?
I'm fine.
What's the surprise?
Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.
See?  She doesn't have one either -  You don't?
What's that?
Oh, come on - you can do better than that.
I hope so.
No!
How did those holes get there?
Yes, I'm holding on.
So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.
Goodbye?
Well, I'll be - !  He does have a bicycle.
They got a Cuban band that's the berries. Why don't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn?
Well, it is to me.  Will you give her a message?  I'd like her to have a little supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight.
The New Caledonia.  That's the name of it.  The Old Caledonia went down during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.  But tell her not to worry - this is going to be a quiet little midnight snack - just the two of us.
We won't breathe a word.
Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.
Yes, Joe.
Well, here we are.
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
We got it second-hand.
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
If Bienstock catches you again - What's the matter with you, anyway?
No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
Bingo?
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
Then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone, and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.
That's a quarter of a century. Makes a girl think.
Why not?
Want to switch berths with me?
I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
My fault.
Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
That must be it.
They do indeed.  Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -
- and always the same Four Hundred.
I beg your pardon?
Tonight?
It's been delightful meeting you both.
You heard her - yes.
It's not the icebergs.  But there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this.
What happened?
I'm afraid not.  I can't make it tonight.
Not tomorrow, either.  You see, I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away.
Where to?  South America?  Oh. That is unexpected.
Quite a while.  As a matter of fact, I'm not coming back at all.
Not always.  But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.
Sugar!  What do you think you're doing?
I come to the old lady's funeral.
Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.
You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!
Well, Spats Colombo - if I were saw one.
Hello, copper.  What brings you down to Florida?
Why?
Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them.
You shave with your spats on?
Me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over Chicago.
And who runs it?
I already told you.
Spats Colombo.
If you want a ringside table, tell 'em you're one of the pall bearers.
Why wouldn't I?
What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
You don't owe me no nothing.
Christ, Amy.
Pub Golf?
Fred Astaire and whats her face!
Or Kat....
Youd better get going. My parents will be round to cart you off to the country.
Does Kat know?
I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now shes getting married.
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldnt split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.
Um, just about everyone.
And Kat was fully clothed.
Its called character. God, youre predictable.
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
Im sorry?
Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
You know, they say you can tell everything you need to know about a person from the way they act when theyre naked.
Jeffrey knows love like he knows macram.
What did he say exactly? I mean, you dont think he wants me back?
Six thousand, right?
How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
Have you ever done anything like this before?
A weekend?
Sorry. Im a little nervous. I never thought something like this would happen to me.
How did you know that was me?
And what if I didnt want you to...to do that to me?
When I said Id never done a wedding before, I didnt say that no one ever asked. I just never said yes.
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
Give it back? Are you nuts?
Dad!
Im worried. Amys not good at drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker?  Is it drunker or drunker-er?
Shes drunk. -er than me. But I didnt really dump you, did I?
You don't live around here, do you?
I don't know, he's in a prison camp.
David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder.  That feels better.
You got a pretty house, Miss Johnson!
... So me and Sounder, ran right by the men that was the prisoners, and crawled under the fence! That's when I cut my hand on the glass. It hurt like mad! But I kept runnin', and then I didn't feel no more hurtin' till I stopped runnin'!  Why was that, Miss Johnson?
Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...
You could? How?
And so you did your job, right?
You know that the class is going to challenge your story, don't you, Clarence?
Yes, Miss Johnson...
I did look, Charlie, but I--
Don't tell me about what's wrong. You come into my office as a friend and steal city files! I could have you arrested for that -- and if you give out that information to anybody, that's exactly what I'm going to do -- and I'll tell everybody in this town how you got the information and who you got it for! You won't have a friend left in this county to bring you a piece of candy!
I wanna go -- the trip don't bother me none.
We goin' huntin' again tomorrow ?
Mama is outside with Josie Mae and Earl.
We didn't find Sounder yet.
We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?
From Miss Johnson --
You know somethin', Daddy?
What's that, son?
What's your daddy's name?
Miss Boatwright --
Ready to go, Mama!
Poor creature...
She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
What's wrong with him, David?
What's wrong, Nathan?
Hello, David...
They probly thought you was crazy.
Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?
Whatcha wanta order?
Hi ya, Rebecca...
Good mornin', Nathan.
You ready to eat?
I just got out here!
Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me.
Why the fuck not?
What is this?
They're burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war.
Oh, son of a bitch!  AAGHGH!! I mean, son of a biscuit!
You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY IMPORTANT do you understa-
Aw, screw it. It probably isn't all that good anyway.
I can't believe he's dead.
What Cartman?!
Eric!  Don't talk to Ms. Brovlofski that way!
Ugh... You guys, seriously... I'm having Cheesy Poof withdrawal...
Kyle?!
Ha! Is the Pope Catholic?
Oh no, it's that kid.
I am Satan. I am your God, now.
What? What do you mean you don't belong here? Relax guy, hell is for children.
Mrph mprhm mm rmph!
What's the password?
Dude, anybody who doesn't think Terrance and Phillip is funny can fuck off anyways.
Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip!!
All it says is that it's above the vulva... But where the hell is the vulva?
Wait! Before we put a message out, do a search on the word 'clitoris'.
Oh Lord, what have we done...?
We have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers.  It's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach American soil!
What did my son say, Principal Victoria? Did he say the S word?
Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
But I-
Well, fuck my ass and call me a bitch, I just got a letter!
You'd fuck your uncle!
Fight the power!
Don't call me dumb!
<b>What if I, don't wanna put out? That's all you ever say Relax put out I'm a living creature, I have feelings too, I don't need this abuse from you-</b>
My friend the clitoris told me.
Cool!
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for-</b>
Bedrock!  I cannot dig any further in zis direction!
Evening.
So...
Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.
I was there.  Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors.  They are not functioning properly.
Why should she, it's her fault. All guests are told not to eat in zero gravity, but she just wanted to have fun I guess, didn't realize what a grain of salt can do to sophisticated machinery.
Well I guess there's no time like the present.  I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.
There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
What, and leave you here all by your lonesome?
Barnes?
Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
It depends on the condition of the ship.  If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.
Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.
Yeah.  We did it.
Taylor?
He's out of the equation.  Talk to me.
What do you mean?  What happened!
Will you marry me?
So I've been told.
Homesick?  It's only been two days!
Well now what are we gonna do!
How am I supposed to know?
Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
Now Mac, can you tell me the status of this deck?
Yeah, basement bingo.
Three whips. To go.
- canker sore.
It's a beautiful thing.
Buzz Fazeli.
I got suspended when I was young, too. I was pretty cocky in my day.
What do you think I can do?
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
Don't say that about my mom!
I gotta survive.
You got a better offer?
I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.
The whole world thinks you're underground.
Millie, I know what I'm doing.
You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?
It depends.
You shouldn't touch her.
I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.
Someone gonna get kacked, boss?
Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
I like the sport the way it is.
Grasp firmly. Then what?
Yeah.
Now swing it out a little to the right...
Is Mr. Fazeli in please?
This is a sign! Someone's coming to take Buzz away from me. I don't know if you're the guy or what, but I'm not letting it happen. I'm leaving him first.
Here Theo, it's the Fazeli specialty; a seven-ten split. Theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing.
Won't your father help you with that?
Do you have a boyfriend?
What's plan B?
He said he'd sponsor me.
I don't think your new outfit suits you, Theo.
How much would you charge me for the lips?
Zip.
And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.
Too late for what, Sheila?
It's Junior, isn't it.
Where are you going?
Very good, busyboy.
The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality.
... Your civil rights have been overridden!
Fletcher!  Now!
Back at the door -- I asked you to back away.
Yeah.  I heard you.
Nice work, Captain sir.
What if it attacks?
But you've tested it?
Well, thanks for the opportuninty here -- my wife appreciates it.
Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you.
We're moving fast considering the storm.
He's missing.  He's gone.  He left.
You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --
Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
Going active.
It's chipped.
Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?
... spiralling out of the center, you see: "G" is one, "B" is two, "H" is three, and so on... when I got the message.
Are you enjoying yourself, Harry, because I don't know what the hell you're doing.
A half a mile long?
What's wrong?
But what does it do?  This... sphere.
Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --
What is that?
It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.
Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
Where did you get this?
In Edmunds' things.
Don't tell me to calm down!
I don't trust Harry to do it.
The sub's a 100 feet in front of you.  You see it?
Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.
What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
That wasn't in there before.
No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.
Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
This being after you so carefully fixed my suit.
Page 87.
Squids?
After the attack, a Navy guy woke me up -- I don't know -- I thought he was an illusion.  But I checked the tape, and Jerry said he manifested him.
What do you mean, a part of Harry?
But how?
Something for burns.
Nothing about drowsiness.
Tarazine?
Causes sleep.
It's an idea.
You want to kill him?
Where are you?
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
You think I manifested the snakes?
C'mon -- what?
It's not safe for you to be either.
Would it work?
Take politics, our views on abortion, the death penalty...
I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
In time for what?
Where's it coming from?
No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
You sound defensive.
C'mon.
On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "Unknown Entry Event." They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.
Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.
Am I?
What noise?
You don't understand about the sphere.
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
Beth left?
I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there.  Take a look for yourself.
Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.
Did I kill her?
Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.
There is one possibility.
What is it, Harry?
It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Please.  It must have flown here --
Hey, go easy on the salt, will ya? We're not a bunch of icy streets here.
... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate, why use a code?
Does this mean what I think it means?
I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am really, just been a while.  I treat aircrash survivors.
Who's everyone?
Geologists?  At a plane crash?
Strange, isn't it?  You know -- how it would have a button.
There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?
Don't be so supportive, honey.
Luke's got a point... ... Fear is their greatest defense... I doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on Aquilae or Sullust, and what there is is most likely directed toward large-scale assault.
What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?
You could put it that way.
But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!
That's where my father was killed.
Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.
Are you all right?
That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!
You're Starkiller?
All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.
I'd keep that thing close just in case, if I were you... I've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this Force of Others stuff may make for good religion, but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side.
I found it... It's just not there.
They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
You're a good pilot... I've learned a lot from you... I wish you...
We'll send a squad up.
I... I don't know.  I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help.  I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.
I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.
For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
Wait a minute, slow down!... That's better.  They're where?  They what? They are?  Oh, no! We're going to be mashed into conduit before this is over...
We got reinforced. Most of'em just got outa boot...
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on Planet P. That mission had a very low survival probability...
The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
Profile's wrong... there.
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
Who ?
Eeuch !
Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...
How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
Isn't it great to be in love ?
No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance.
I love you, Carmen.
I'm gonna miss you.
I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
Good work, Number 1. You'll do.
It stinks, you goin.
Well, see ya.
We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
Oh, my, what's that ?
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir.
Seeing as how we're about all that's left of  1st Brigade, you'd have to call that an improvement.  You top kick ?
The Marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. Rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?
Courage, I guess.
Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face...
Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !
The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.
The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
All dead except one, sir.
<U>Why</U>...?!
What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
Enterprise would be unable to function <U>without</U> carbon units.
Within you are memory patterns of a carbon unit. If I can help you revive these patterns; you could understand our functions better.
By the Creator.
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate?
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.
Yes.
Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.
Time to impact...?
Five minutes to Cloud boundary!
Hold station.
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
Reporting as ordered, Captain.
You've reported that you felt strong thought emotions. A group of minds from a space vessel? Could you make out any plan, anything to do with Earth?
They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?
Captain, we have been seized by a tractor beam...!
We cannot break free, Captain.  We do not have a fraction of the power necessary.
Spock? Concerned about his chances?
It would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information. A remarkably efficient system.
What should you have known?
No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
We're ready, sir.
I'll be there.
You like my play.
No, of course, you want to get out of town.
That's true.  You grow up here?
But, but but but...
That: in an act of...
Of course.
Cause, cause, it's...it's the <u>simple</u> things, that...
Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station.  It was lovely meeting...
You're still here.
In fact, in fact, in fact, I'm not sure if I'm giving <u>them</u> a second chance, or they're giving it to me.  That's the truth.  The truth's best, don't you think?
But how do I...how do I do a film called "The Old Mill," when I don't have an old mill?
What are you <u>doing</u> tonight?
Fix my glasses.
Oh, God...
Thank you.
Then I'll come back, then.
Hi.
Where you going?
Would you like to <u>see</u> it?  I've got the key back at my store...
How's your star?
That's something a man could do...?
Now you're talking...
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
I...I <u>think</u> that's right...
What are you going to do?
I'll wait for you...I'm proud of you. I'll <u>be</u> waiting.
What is it, a surprise?
Oh.  What were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian...
Let me review here: You're...what are you...you've...it's all over between us?
He had a hard day.  Ann's deserted him for some guy on the movie.
Big day last night.
What courthouse?
They're holding it for ransom.
...why am I here...?
You know who the <u>father</u> is...?
They think it's your First Wife...
...upset and impressionable...  Get me the Mayor...
Whyn't you learn your lines?
The prices are going up.
You look at:  girl comes in the room, an <u>apron</u>, a brown <u>bag</u>, what is she...? She's a...
What...
You can go...
Alright.  Let's...  Page five, the fucking <u>horse</u> dies.  You know, <u>she</u> could be in the movie, she could, she's got a good face, she could be the Doctor's...uh, why does it have to be his, uh, <u>wife</u>...?  It could be his...
Well, yeah, I'm fine, I reached over to, the girl had to be home, I don't know, it's a <u>schoolnight</u>, something...
If your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape.  How long since you almost went to jail for this shit?
You do...?
...I have to give you this <u>ticket</u> for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
Nobody.
He's on the Island, he'll be back on...
I like you, too.
What, what's there to <u>think</u> about?  The scene's perfect...I, I get to say...
Fuck flowers, we aren't talking about flowers, we're talking about a human being.
I'm only trying to...
...I know, I'm so...because I said: yes, a woman who...the...the community <u>respects</u> her.  Please don't go.  Please don't go.  What can I do but beseech you...?  Trauma, <u>toil</u>...when are we free of them...?  When...?
"Bring it in on time and there's more where these came from.  Marty.  P.S. I want to talk to you about a product tie- in..."
Bob Barrenger...Bob...Bob Barrenger's in this movie?
He's staying here?  Bob Barrenger is staying he...?
Yes.
Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?
Who got their heads cut?
I want you to hear this, pal...  Forget the overages, <u>forget</u> Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks.  You know what it would cost for them to <u>build</u> this set?  Two Million Dollars!  Now:
Doug...
What is the...?
And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White saw the crime.
What's in the case?
I'm looking for the writer.
Who's White...?
I...
I'm very sorry I...
I'm trying, honey...I'm...look, is your Ma, when is your <u>Mom</u> coming?  Oh.  What did the <u>midwife</u>...?
My <u>wife's having a baby</u>...
Does it have to be an Old Mill?  Where have you been?
I can only write on a manual.
Grace...
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
I...?  I saw it.  I was there.
Did you bring Bob's weights?
Find the money.
We got the permit.
There's no witnesses...
That we could use you in and I think that's quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.
The chairs go, the Lazyboy goes...
...we need the shooting permit for Main Street...
You see where Tom Miller's playin' the Old Farmer?
Bet you did.
No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning of the <u>film</u> <u>is</u> in that shot.
Guinevere, Godiva, I sense enemy sol...
So what's up?  Who's marrying who <u>this</u> time?
Mass hysteria.
I can't hear you.
A debate.  Man's inhumanity to woman.  He's pro women.  I'm con. Ms. Flannery is twisted.
You don't like his friends.
I'm not.
And Mom says anger never, never <u>solves</u> anything.  It makes every- thing <u>worse</u>.
...your hating me.
Then have a donut --
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
&quot;Goodnight moon, goodnight hush, goodnight mush, goodnight goodnight goodnight Gracie -- Goodnight Ben!
IS THAT YOU?
I hate snails and blue cheese. Especially together.  <u>Hate</u>.
Mommy?  It's not Rachel's fault I ran away.
What honey?
Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country. Like Canada.  Only smaller.
Yes.
No.
In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you...held you so ti-ight...
Rache says it's from you.
So what do you think we're gonna talk about?
Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow...
That's necessary, huh?
I have to get dressed.  My ex-husband has asked me to dinner.  God knows why, he was very mysteri...
Are you here?
Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.
Me too.
Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.
You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war.  But I'm doing this for <u>their</u> well-being.
I didn't think a phone call was appropriate...
I grew up, a little.  I'm ready for a life that's built around commitm...
The great thing about life is that things keep changing.
Yet another spaghetti night.
We're going to win this.
Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't you have a mother?
Can I please have a cup of coffee?
Look, I...
I'm sorry.  Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but...
What about obsessively picking her split ends?
...thinking of going back to Random House.  On a part-time basis.
I got used to...thinking of them. As...my kids too.
How the hell would you know?
See, I know that.
That thing you said before.  Pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. Because of what you gave up for motherhood...
Looks nice enough to m...
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity.  For some <u>real</u> growth.
Thanks for coming out.
Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
You're the hip and fresh.
You'll learn.
You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...
We have to talk.
I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
Get ready.  To get <u>really</u> mad.
Hey, I sold my body to Satan to clear Friday at two o'clo...
Well, I think you should tell him you changed your mi...
'...I don't know if I can make it.' That's what I said.  But I didn't leave.
Does Jackie know this?
I don't know what's wrong with that kid.
There are some rumors...
No prob. I'm cool.
I'll be your guest!
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
When I'm in high school I'm not going to play any football. I'm just going to concentrate on class rank.  What did you do in high school?
But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
Mi Jesus esta muerto!
My Jesus
Maybe it's for the bestI mean, if he was guilty of doing  something wrongPeople who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so?
The camerawork's nice.
No, no, no. No exploitation. This is seriousBut don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time?
Well, I need to see this with an audience!
Huh?
You mean, again?
You're tired of me. I can tell.
The same. Same as what?
One in a million recover.
I don't think there's any hope, either. I was just trying to make you feel better.
Uh huh.
Thank you.  So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
Ni...
No, not really.
None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?
C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
Great!
Great!
Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on.
I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.
Uh, well, anyway, so I'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia. Kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology. I wrote to Derrida to see if he'd like to do the narration. But everything's still kind of in development at this point.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Pretty cool, Stanley.
Thanks.
Gee, your Dad's smart.
I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV.
Prnceton.
We don't have time!
What about rule one:  never let the person you are protecting out of your sight!
Well Filmore--
I don't see why they wouldn't be.
Are you going to kill us?
And--of course there is the human cost, which is incalculable.
So, what are we looking at White?
What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
Of course it's codified!  Each number probably corresponds to a compound.  Have them pull every compound from the lab and compare it to the codes till you figure it out--that's what you're here for.
Something tells me you don't want to be on TV, friend.
What are you so worked up about jack? Fuck 'em--we don't need 'em.
What's happening at the waterfront?
Are we adrift--
Now, Mister Ambassador.  In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone.  I intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.
At his office in the Capitol.
I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.
Naturally.  It would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country.  But this way we know it's safe, and we don't have the problem of delivering it.
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!
Operator...How much would the call be station-to-station?...Thirty-five cents cheaper?...I'd still be short twenty cents ...Just a second, operator...  Colonel, shoot the lock off the Coke machine.  There's bound to be enough change in there.
Go back to sleep, baby.
To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.
Just a second, sir.  He's got films of the War Room in that thing!
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
This is General Ripper speaking.
All right, Major.  I'm putting the base on condition Red.
Condition Red!
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
You're a good officer, Major Mandrake.  You have a right to know.  It looks like we're in a shooting war!
Major, that's all I've been told.  Just got it on the red phone.  The base is to be sealed tight.  And I mean tight.
We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we?
I understand, sir.  Nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so.
To you, sir.  But how do I know?
Are you questioning my orders, Major?
Thank you, sir.
I don't think so, sir.
That's close enough, Major.
And I guess they won't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country.
But we mean it because we are a peace- loving country.  Are they a peace-loving country, Major.
Go on, Major.
That's right, sir.  And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb.  What if they start something?
But, General, we're on our toes.  We haven't agreed to anything for years.  Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.
If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.
General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.
It was a honest mistake, sir.
We estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty-five min- utes.
Well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the "Leper Colony", failed to receive the recall.
General, stick to the point, please.
A through H is correct.
Forty-five.  Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock.
I think they mean business.
Lieutenant Toejam, are you ready for Bim and Bam?
So am I.
I've got one.
Second safety.
What happened?
He's dead, all right.
I mean pulling a stunt like that.
Look, this is different.
I said that's the point!
First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy.
Who's that?
It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?
Are you sure?
Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.
Lothar, can you arm the bombs for impact?
I think it's okay, King.  They should go off on impact.
But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!
But who would be chosen?
I just walked all the way from Westside to here. I haven't walked that far since junior high. I thought you didn't drink.
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
Yeah, I guess.
Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
Hey!
Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.
Yeah.
No, I'm here. Where are you?
Where are you-hoo?
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
No, no, I wasn't trying.
No. Life is too short.
Oh, and guess who showed up.
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
She's dead.
She's dead?
Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
No, no, no.
Yeah, man.
So, how was the ride, kids?
Um, if you're talking to me, could you make some sense? 'Cause I don't speak Swahili.
Whoa!
You make videos?
Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now.
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
You okay, man? You okay?
Okay.
It's nice here. It's different.
No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.
What about me? I don't have a car.
Military marching bands.
Now, how the hell would you know what I think? Hm? You don't know me.
"It's not a job, it's an adventure." Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man.
I'm not a nice guy.
I love writing. A-Anne Rice? I love Anne Rice.
Yeah. Yeah, no, you're right. It's no big deal, you know. Guy probably has his arm around her right now, holding her close, nudging her titty with his elbow, talking about the deep significance of his music, while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes. In a few minutes they'll be back at the Four Seasons. You ever, you ever stayed in one of those places?
Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
What'd you do?
Why? Because I give a shit?
Good, good. I, I hope he does.
Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.
What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit.
No.
You know, this, what you're doing with your life...
I don't know.
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.
No, no. It's an honest question. What are you trying to communicate?
Um, because you didn't want to go.
Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
It got that close.
Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?
Us.
Come with me.
No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
No, I don't.
Come on.
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
Oh, yeah?
God, you smell like whiskey.
Well, what about us?
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
Yeah.
Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?
Sorry.
Well, I helped start it, but, you know, uh...
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife.
You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here.
Ready?
Look at you!
It's pretty exciting.
Yeah. To go to school and, you know, paint, performances, paint.
You have to go. You always did such, uh, you know, great work. I still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm moving.
I don't know. I say what I mean.
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
You know, my mom has this saying.
Yeah?
Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking language, alright? Or I might have to.
No, see, Neil, if you're fucking with one of my friends, then you're fucking with me.
Yeah?
I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you?
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
I'm going out later.
I just pulled and it - it came off.
Sorry, Kansas...
Di, we're sorry.  We...
Look, you're fat, Diane.  You're fat, fat, fat!  Because you eat, eat, eat!  What?!  She keeps asking because she wants some honesty.
... I don't know.  Probably not.
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
Y'think?
I sure do.
Let me explain something...
Shut up.
Kansas!
Bullets?  No bullets!  Oh my gosh, these are just to scare people. Kinda like round-off, back handspring, whip back, double full.  You never really use it - you just want the opposing squad to know you've got it.
Look, maybe I can watch a PG movie... I'll just say I'm counting dirty words for Sunday School.
Hello?
...my Sunday School teacher says that in prison, women shove broom sticks up your...
Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.
Yeah.  This summer at church camp?  I'm pretty sure I had, y'know, an orgasm.
You sure you wanna go there?
They could kill you.
Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
It must be about that appalling script of hers.  What can I say to her? What can I say?
Well, what do you know ! Joe Gillis !
Sure, this'll go on all night.
It's from hunger.
This is Miss Kramer.
If I could be of any help...
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
There's one called....Window... something with a window.
The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --
You'll be waiting for me?
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.
You sure have.
If you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams.  If you get an Oscar, I get the left foot.
You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.
It must be my new shampoo.
Why not?
Why did she call me?
Joe, I can't look at you any more.
Hello, young fellow.
Nothing.  I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio.  I had no idea how I'd missed it.
It's a good script, isn't it?
It's got a lot of good things.  Of course, it would be an expensive picture...
Get out.
They're dead.  They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world.  But that wasn't good enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too.  So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...
Yeah?
I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
The wind gets in that blasted pipe organ.  I ought to have it taken out.
We've made a lot of pictures together.
Me?  I'm busy.  Just finished one script.  I'm due on another assignment.
Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
Unpack nothing.  I didn't say I was staying.
Cut away from me?
Not now, my dear.  I'm playing three no trump.
I need some money right now.
I don't need any clothes, and I certainly don't want you buy- ing them for --
Joe,  you look absolutely divine.  Turn around!
What's that?
"Mad about the boy."
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?
Go away.  Go to that girl of yours.
He must be quite a guy.
I went for a walk.
It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to you.
And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.
Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.
Madame is waiting.
I made your bed this afternoon.
There is the bathroom.  I put in soap and a toothbrush.
Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
I'm talking to you.  My clothes and things are up in the room.
You send them.  Is that it, Max?
How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
Joseph C. Gillis?
Relax, fans.  The car isn't here.
I lent it to a friend of mine. He took it up to Palm Springs.
Haven't got a thing.
Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.
Don't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach?  Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo- Romanoff rut, you're through.
I've discovered a new way into the Phantom Zone.
Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game?
Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK?
He will be. In about five minutes.
A Storm Dragon?
Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.
That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.
At last. Ultimate Power.
What do you want?
Wait...don't leave me in here...
What's happening?
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
Is this how?
But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---
Just like that?
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
I did.
They think I have a concussion.
Nurse! Nurse!
This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.
I don't want your help.
If that worked, you would've done it already. No, you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one again.
Hey, where you going?
What about my proposal?
Do you have any theories about last night?
I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But I don't know what it is.
He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
Yes.
Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
Why didn't you tell me?
Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
I just did. Because I have the Power.
Balefire on you, Selena!
Who are you ?
Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
What? Palace? Hardly.
Of course, my dear. What can I do?
I knew it!
Why?
Then teach me how.
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
Mr. Roebush?
S'not bad, s'very good, but... y'know what's wrong with this... Singapore...thing?
Brad.
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
Brad Wilson.
You know what's the problem?
There's a lot of choices here.
Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
Well, aren't you excited?
Mr. Kent! Superman was here!
Sure.
Keep talking to that state trooper so he doesn't notice where I'm going, okay?
Thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment, thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens. Do you know what you are?
So where is all them half-centses?
Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
But y'see, chum, the problem I got is that one country just won't play ball with me.  You know how that can just bug a guy, don't you?
Uh...what channel were you watching?
Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.
Is this blackmail?
What will it do?
Gus, it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking "get-down hot-cha daddy-o" whatever you called it.
Stone mutha.
I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...
I didn't have my camera with me.
It's hard to believe... a great looking girl like you all alone like this. As she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered, then...finally...just realistic:
Turn on the light.
Mr. White, please, it's time for you to draw this month's winning JINGO number.  The prize is an all-expenses trip to South America.
Mr. White, you be in this shot, handing them their plane tickets.
I don't kiss.
Where did it come from?
A normal person.
He's coming! He's going to hurt me!
I don't?
Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.
I was. . . uh. . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh, arrangements.  Sleeping arrangements.
Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
Superman? Oh, was he here?
Who ????
Lois, I . . .
I want to.
Sleep well?
Get your head out of the clouds, Kent. Where you been  the last twelve hours?
Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
Lex...Lex, how could you do that to Otis?
What else is ballast for?
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
Isn't that what the old Canaveral guys used to call a comet on an East-West trajectory?
A gang of terrorists seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris
You no longer can serve humanity if you invest your time and emotion in one of them at the expense of the rest.  Surely this is not how you repay their gratitude, Kal-El. Could you really abandon the weak and the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream.
Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.
Now This I want to hear.
The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that -
Oh my Fullness, as I explained to you before, I am about the best there is. Second best there is.
Oh, General, the world is a big place. Thank goodness, my needs are small...As  it turns out, I have this affinity for beachfront property . . .
What do you want?
Perhaps there is some good in you after all, Lex Luthor.
They make my eyes itch.
Daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other companies. But, I've been thinking maybe I'll take some time off.  I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a  farm . . .  see what the slow lane is like.
Any more like you back home, Clark?
You'll find a good man Lacy. You deserve one.
'Are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense?'
It must have been a super effort to get out of bed, Clark.
But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?
This letter was addressed to Superman care of me.
I know I'm not exactly a Girl Scout but . . . maybe if I show him I'm trying . . . he'll like me.
He missed the door, Uncle Lex.
Superman broke your monster, Uncle Lex.
You think he'll find us.
Destroy Superman!
You'll be designing monuments soon, Albert! Hotels! Palaces!
There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.
You're a great architect, Albert.
Thank you.
I know. He sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother.
Huh?
It's not what you think. Darn it. I'm going out on a story. The Secretary of Defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he'd rather duck.
You were probably so scared you didn't look to see what the trick was.
Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
You're just jealous.
Superman.  Pretty good name for him, isn't it?
Super...man. Hmmm...
Besides that.
What can I tell you? He's my leader.
This??
Fifty degrees below and still falling.
Krypton!
See? I see. It's you who don't see. Doesn't see. I cannot believe it! How you people fail to grasp the long-range significance of this! Y'know?
Mr. Romance...
I don't mean to denigrate your misspent youth, Lex, but what does that rock have to do with --
Nothing, nothing. I just want to invite him to tea.
You got wax in your ears?
Then -
How come you get all the good stories, Lois?
What's your name, boy?
He sure as heck does that.
A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
I guess I got carried away
....to feel yourself. Very well. You are revealed to the world. But still you must keep your secret identity. First of all, you will need it as an escape valve. You cannot be special twenty-eight hours a day -
Lois, the kickback story...
Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize, I know.
Thirty-five.
How much do you weigh?
I don't need a geography lesson, Luthor.
It's just that  --  I spent a fortune on these things!  And all for naught! What a waste  --
Maybe I should get help.
Now who's the dreamer, Superman? Even you can't fly that fast!
How are you?
I'm just fine, Ally.  What about you?
What happened?
Alison.
Why are you telling me this?
Why?
Why would he do that?  You didn't have anything to do with the accident.
I used to like it here.  I used to care about what happened.  Now I think I'll sell my house and move the fuck away.
Billy, please.  The children.
Nicole's coming over to look after the kids tonight.  She'll be there around six.
Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me.
They can look forward to that.
Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses?  That she was wearing it when the bus crashed?
What do you mean by that, Dolores?
Billy loved to see his kids in the bus.  They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It comforted him.
You talked about it?
And what's that?
You mentioned that he had a learning disability.
I did.
Excuse me?
Why would he be frightened?
Good morning, Wanda.  Hi, Hartley.
I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.
It's for the school bazaar.
Away from your crazy Mom.
Summer's over.  It's fall.
From you?
What's a ditty again?
Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
Will you be spending more than a night?
She...she was a friend of mine.
What do they do?
Have they ever been busted?
Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window?  How old was I, Daddy?  Five or six?  I got absolutely soaked, remember?
The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.
Yes.
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it register?
You've been retained?
No.
How does the family survive?
Yes.
There wasn't time?
Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.
That's too high.  I'll never reach it.
How will he do that?
He couldn't look at me.  But I looked at him.  Right at him.  His secret was mine now.  We used to share it.  But not anymore.  Now, I owned it completely.
Yes.
I don't know.
You ought to stop this nonsense, Loretta, these two dollar bets.
Boys, this gets nobody nowhere - you're over excited, Steve and -
I want to speak to Miss Hunsecker, please.
Not that I'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years.  Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives!
When do these hot-headed boys of yours go on the road?
Coupla weeks.  For eight weeks.
I see Bartha gave you cold tongue for supper.  Hey, wait a minute!
Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...
I'm taking up the situation with you now...
And I believe that's precisely where I read it, too.  You see, J.J., where I get my reputation for being the best-informed man in Washington.
Hello, Harry.
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
Spahish...that must show he likes "spigs", too.
You want something done, J.J., but I doubt if you yourself know what's involved.
I know Steve.  No.
What's this boy got that Susie likes?
Full of beans, ain't you?  But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...
Let's forget cats and dogs and other pseudo-literary remarks--- I'll just lay it on the line!  What about that big rumpus in my office today?  You were there, Frank! Where, according to St. Dallas, J.J. was responsible for the Elwell smear!
What are you so chipper about?  If I put a cross on every one of your mistakes, you'd look like a graveyard!
But not for anything I did today...
Talk to her, Sidney...
You're incapable of the truth...
He goes out with girls.
Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
In his apartment -
Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.
Yeah!
And he's a perfect stranger to me.
Nothing I didn't think of you before.
The renting agent and the tailor.
You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
Why me...?
I hope that J.J. really likes Steve, that it isn't an act.
Susie, whatever problems you have with J.J. - I didn't invent them! What're you blaming me for?  If you learned to let out your hatred you would be better off!
What do you do for that hundred a week.  Fall out of bed?
Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
And on Monday, I'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
You going to work all day?
Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. It's a neural-net process --
Do you know about the chip?
I'm right here.  I'm fine.  What's the dog's name?
Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?
That is one of my mission parameters.
Excellent.
"No fate."  No fate but what we make.  My father told her this... I mean I made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her -- Never mind.  Okay, the whole thing goes "The future is not set.  There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."
I guess, yeah --  Oh shit!!
Dyson.
This is tactically dangerous.
Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.
So she's pretty cool, huh?
If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.
The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
Why attack Russia?
Relax now, Sarah --
Where do you stand on all this?
That's because you had a proper upbringing.
Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
Respect your elders and your betters!
'Please remember that Dr. Furtwngler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.'
So, what does the Russki want?
Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
Major, show me someone who hasn't made an anti-Semitic remark and I'll show you the gates of paradise.
Colonel. Pleasure.
In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.
Your mother, too.
Major, Major... he's here ...
Bruckner's Seventh, Major.
Of course.
I'm sorry but I have to leave. I'll find other work. You'll have to get someone else, that's all.
I can't do this. It's not right.
But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.
If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?
I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
Then why did you conduct at one of their Nuremberg rallies?
Your guess is as good as mine.
So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?
They were Jews, they had to leave. They were right to leave.  I could not leave my country in her deepest misery. After all, I am a German.  I... I stayed in my homeland. Is that my sin in your eyes?
Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.
When I last saw you, I was unprepared. I did not know what to expect. In these past weeks, I have been thinking more carefully and making some notes.  You have to understand who I am and what I am. I am a musician and I believe in music. I am an artist and I believe in art. Art in general, and music, in particular, has for me mystical powers which nurture man's spiritual needs. I must confess, however, to being extremely naive.  I insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics. My entire life was devoted to music because, and this is very important, because I thought that I could, through music, do something practical.
Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?
What telegram?
'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
Think carefully, Wilhelm... maybe not in your own name, but as Privy Councillor or Vice-President.
No, because I had only one intention. My only intention whatever I did was to show that music means more than politics.
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding.
I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.
Okay, so what is it?
Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
What?
Was a member of...?  Speak up?
I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return.
Yes, Dr. Furtwngler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.
It was Beethoven's Ninth.
I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
What do you think?
Yes.  Don't hurt me.
There's so much...
I'm sure.
Okay.  Talk some more.
What about it?
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
I'm dying for a shower.  You could use one too.  And we'd better check that bandage.
It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh?  You must be pretty disappointed.
Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.
What are you doing?
SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me.
I can't sleep.
Give me the short version.
Here's her driver's license.
You promised you'd meet projections, Alan.  A dollar sixty per share you said.  So, I don't think this is so surprising a visit.
But, the expectation was ten.  And, in this case, expectation is everything.
You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...
I'm so sorry.
I apologize, sir, I'm having a bad day...
Let's talk to whoever can get this over with...
Where are you going?
Where'd you all go?  Motherfucking frat boys.  You better hide.  Is your life so pathetic that this is something you're willing to pay for?
Read what it says: "Warning, do <u>not</u> attempt to open.  If elevator stops, use emergency... "
If there was one.
It's much easier this way.  Come on, step up...
What's C.R.S.?
That one did.
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
What are you doing here?
Overseas operator?  Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.
All I mean is... someone like you...
Bullshit.  They killed him. Feingold, Fisher, whoever... they shot him...
I have to get to the airport...
Like... where are you from?
One brother, one sister.
Single?
Underwear?
Hey there, Nickie.
"Seymour Butts."  I never get tired of that one.
They gave me a free jacket at the door.
This isn't an escort service?
They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you.  And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the <u>real</u> fucking begins.
How do you know?
You're part of it...
No money, no identification or passport.  You are in a fix.  What did happen to you?
What happened was, I'm on vacation, alone... I was robbed, at gunpoint. They hit me and ran.  Two men, a few blocks away.  They took my wallet, money... all of it.  So...
What kind of vacation?
Get rid of them.
You don't need me...
You did?  How is he?
Ilsa... you're alright?
Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
I'm just like him.
No.
No.
Let me think...  Hordes of men in tuxedos.  Everyone's droning.  Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick...
Someone's playing hardball.  It's complicated.  Can I ask a favor?
Find out about a company called C.R.S.  Consumer Recreation Services.
What?
The children.  The children Hugh Crain built the house for.  The children he never had.
Do you need me anymore?  Cause I'm going to bed.  They can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want, but I gotta try to get some sleep.
It's not going to hold your weight.
He said that Hugh Crain... Hugh Crain was a monster.  He said that he was a brutal, horrible man.  He told me that Crain drove his workers to early deaths.  Crain had children chained to the looms in his mill.  And listen to this: his beautiful Rene killed herself.
That depends on your definition of ghosts.  I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.
Yeah.
Nell --
And that will be a good place to end this study.
I don't know.
It was a stupid thing to do.
Why?
But you told me to look in the paper!  You told me I'd be perfect!
Oh God, we can't get out!
I'm a scientist.  I just conducted an experiment.  Now I have to write it up.
It's a job.  I keep banker's hours.  I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six.  You can serve yourselves.  Breakfast is ready at nine.  I don't wait on people.  I don't stay after dinner.  Not after it begins to get dark.  I leave before dark comes.  We live in town.  Nine miles.  So there won't be anyone around if you need help.  We couldn't even hear you, in the night.
Why would we --
I love this house.  I really love this house.
Maybe you did it yourself.
I'll take that as a compliment.  In the city, what kind of place do you live in?
What'd you come back for, babe?
Is that a problem?
It's not a knock.
I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.
Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.
How'd you like to kill someone for me?
I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds.
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
You broke last time.
Fuck you.
You're in gun country now, my friend.
I didn't even know who I was writing to -- just someone with the same last name. She never talked about any family.
Terry Valentine.
What more is there.
Did Jenny know?
You should talk to Elaine.  That was her best friend.
These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.
You hadda show up on a weekend.  This weekend.  Wouldn't've even been a gun show ... for another month.
Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
What?
What's so fucking funny?
You goin' back inside?
Steady on.
How d'you mean?
I was skint -- didn't have no money to get here.
And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.
Said it went on for donkey's years.
Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
You weren't disappointed in her, then.
When did you get in?
You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.
That's what was estimated.
I bet.
I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
What do you think.
Terry's never going to give you satisfaction.  Not the type.
She told you all about my details but not about his.  Lovely.
This town's been chewing my flesh since ... what we now refer to as "the early 70's."  Christ, my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me.
Early 70's.  I was away.  Maidstone.  Possibly Brixton.
What did you do?  To make them take the early 70's away from you.
From pursuing your chosen profession.
I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.
She used to tell me she'd turn me in.  Little kid.  Ten year old.  "If you're naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya."  She didn't want me sent down again, see. When I was planning some job.  "I'll tell 'em, Dad, I promise I will.  Here, look, I'm calling the Old Bill right now" -- picking up the telephone.  I can see her, the phone in her hand.  Became a sort of joke between us.  Only it wasn't a joke.
Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.
Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.
Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.
No kidding.
Out on a oil rig.  In the North Sea. Nine years.
I got half.
I don't know.
Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.
Where is he, then?
In a couple of days this whole thing --
Who's looking for you?
You must know Ian.
Tell you ...
At night, there were lights--we both saw them. We never told anyone, outside of our official report.
Hello, Rachel.
Geez, Mr Crane.
Birdy--
I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--
...Was that a pass?
I got the paperwork here. Partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I supply professional services, you supply the capital. I'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh?
...Yeah, that's it. As per our discussion.
How's business, Dave?
Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop?
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
...What kind of man *are* you?
...Huh?
...Doesn't become a matter of public record unless there's foul play. However. I don't believe I'm *prohibited* from telling you this. I guess I'm not obliged to tell you, either. I don't exactly know.  But if *I* were the man, I'd want to be told.
...Hell, I hope I've done the right thing.
*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*
It was Big Dave's.
Will anyone else say they knew?
How did you get into the store?
...Probity.
Well, the best, the money-is-no-object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't know how you're fixed for money.
Uh-huh. He's the, uh...
Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long distance here.
Yeah.
Frank.
Yeah.
Whuddya mean?
Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons of bitches!
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
They sent us to tell ya. We pulled the detail.
Yes, sir.
He's a barber.
...Yeah, it's a tough break.
His eyes are open.
I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?
Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan.  Move.
I don't want to scare people.
For Chrissake, I'll do it.  What's the combination?!
The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito.  Why don't you just tell me how this space station works.
What doors?
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
We need light in here, stat.
Whose footprints?
Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago?  Twelve bodies on board.
So the method of death is the only connection?
I've got to admit, that was a damn sight better than "the dog ate my homework".
Dr. John Whittlesley.
Please.  Don't humiliate me further.
What are they?
So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.
This means there must be an animal loose in the museum!
We're not supposed to go back there.
Hard to read in this light.  The ink is so faded.
Come on.  Let's get back to the others.  We can't leave them alone.
I have the species identification on these teeth.  We can extract DNA and start running tests on the extrapolator program.  Call Dr. Frock.  He wanted a demonstration.
Pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains!
Somehow, when all this happened... I knew it would come back to John.  Is he really dead?
You were going to be married.
I don't understand.
I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?
Wounded?
That was D'Agosta.
I think... it means it's full.
You smell that?
I want to book a flight to Fiji.
Where exactly?
It's the busy season.
Why wouldn't I?
You want to book the flight?
Give me a shot from Truman's ring.
Of course, there hasn't been anything to compare with this - the first time an intruder has been a former cast member--
--and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role.  I really must congratulate you on writing Kirk back in.  A master stroke.
How <i>do</i> you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence?
We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?
Who knew that a show originally meant to last one year - "Bringing Up Baby" - would turn into a "cradle to grave" concept.  He is in fact the first child in the world to be legally adopted by a corporation.
Why do you feel that Truman's never come close to discovering the true nature of his world?
A show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
But why didn't he just follow her to Fiji?
Well, what do you want to do?
See here, this is us.  All the way round here, Fiji.  You can't get any further away before you start coming back.  Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.
So when are you leaving?
This is where it started.
No.
When you were hauling chickens for Kaiser Poultry, what was the furthest you ever went off the island?
And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you.  Think about it, Truman, if everybody's in on it, I'd have to be in on it too. I'm not in on it, because there is no <i>it.</i>
Hi, honey.  Look at this.  It's a "Chef's-Mate."  Dicer, slicer and peeler in one.  Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe.
What're you doing down here?
Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.
I know.
I'm sorry, I'm late.
Let's go now.
About time they started cleaning up the trash Downtown.  We don't want to end up like the rest of the country.
Tell her, tell her...I had to go to Fiji. I'll call her when I get there.
Well, thank you for your help.
Who?
Were you there--how do you know?
--It doesn't matter.  Everybody knows about it.  They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared.
Well, we're FBI agents.
I need your clothes, Byers.
I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me --
What is it you find incredible?
Yes.
Feds are looking for him, too.  Real nice business he's got, huh?
What's that?
We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington.
You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found.
My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil.
I know the name. Why?
Who sent you?
I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.
See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.
When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.
Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.
What?
I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.
How's that?
...thirteen fifty six...
Scully?
All I told them was the truth.
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
According to this tag.
And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam.
You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.
Why are you whispering?
I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
I don't know, Mulder.
This virus -- it... 
It may be extraterrestrial.
We've got to keep moving.
Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization.
About what?
-- if it looks bad, it's bad for the FBI --
Are we being watched?
You're lying.
But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha.
More concerns than that?
We've been over this a dozen times.  No.
I'd be there for him.
Damn him.
I don't need them anymore...
What about Julia?
This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore.  Not to him.  He never finished her.  The others...he was able to make them his.
You think you can do this, don't you?
This is Stargher we're talking about?
What difference does it make...?
You're sure of that?
Thank you.
Agent Cole.
You're kidding me.
Not a gift.  A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all.  A genetic fluke.
Intravenous administration complete.
Catherine!
Nervous?
I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs?
Prevacid.  For my stomach.
I don't have to.
...at all.
Tell me about him.
When...what did you do?
What's the matter?
Wer ist da?
A parrot...Let it go.
...you know.
That's his headache.
His.
You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt - you were intimate with Lime, weren't you?
Do you know this man?
No.
He works in a military hospital.
There you are, miss, your receipt for the letters.
Been here long?
You've had a bit of a shock, haven't you? You could do with a drink.
Back in school. Never so lonesome in my life till he showed up.
Must have known I was broke. Even sent me an airplane ticket. It's a shame.
Listen, Callaghan.
That is the racket Harry Lime organized.
Next, Paine.
So would I.
Goodness, that's awkward.
What about?
Mr. Holly Martins, sir.
Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
Why not?
I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
Coffee.
...you know and all that.
Dr. Winkel?
In great pain?
Mr. Martins...
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
What are you doing in Thailand? Tourist?
Bonjour.
She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
It would be nice though, if there was a place like that. You know, that no one could get to.
Why?
I don't know - I'm American.
Two.
Did you sleep well?
So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
That is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that Englishmen and Americans always say to French girls so that they can sleep with them.
Too far?
The Zionists aren't Nazis.
They don't have extermination camps.
...So she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on? And I think fuck it....
What do you care?
It's called the flame alphabet. It's supposed to be the word of God written in fire.
Fire...
Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do.
Fifty's an exaggeration. Anyway, that was a different moment. Things were possible that aren't now.
Why no silencer?
"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
How come there's no punctuation?
No.
Why not?
Payn tash-chiton v'ashiytem...
I told you, I'm good at this.
Nothing.  Why are you doing this?  I thought God didn't exist.
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
And be crushed.
Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews.
It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.
No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
I agree.
You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt.
Are all Jews the same?
Do you know who you're fucking with here?
Give me a reason not to.
It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
But if the Jews are strengthened by hate, wouldn't this "destruction" you speak of -- by love or by any other means -- in fact make them more powerful than they are already?
I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
I thought you hated Torah.
What part of Germany are you people from?
Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.
But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.
Ah, Jesus Christ, Danny, how can you wear that thing?... You know what it means? To your people...
Nobody ever beat me up.  Look, Linda, there're fifty reasons. Even if you knew them all, there'd be another fifty you didn't know.
Do you know them?  I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and --
Which was his room?
Shut up. Fuck you....
That's all we've got left.
When do you want it to go off?
She's at Yale Law -- interning with the district attorney...  We're getting married next spring. In Israel.
Danny, listen, people expect me to daven; they don't want someone they don't know -- leading their prayers.
How?
"Do chickens give milk?"
Not like Mr. Dorfmann.
After your mother died, that's when you stopped going to shul. Doing your homework. Everything.
Oh, fuck you...
What do you mean?
I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
Are you going to keep it?
Yes.
Listen, I just found out we've got real problems in Sicily!
What's happened??
I'll send Cardoza, he'll be able to...
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.
The Italian, I presume?
Hello!
I might have known.  As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.
... It's easy.  You go down.  You come up.  ... Right, Johana?
And the lights!  Running lights, stealing stretchers...!  You'll have us in jail.
What else is there?
Enzo, what are you going to do with the money?
And... does the voice come back?
Jacques, my friend, how are you?
I remember.  Hi Roberto!
It's okay.
Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!
Damn right!  That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
C'mon, you two... Jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight.  We have a new world champion.
Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.
... Everything.
Everything about what?
You don't have that one, do you?
Don't you have a heater?
I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
I thought you'd be at the dinner.
You look adorable.
Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
Just checking up on your family.  I guess I was drunker than I thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... Well...
She's not like the others.  She can't stand to be away from the sea.
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
How are you?
No... tell me.
You'll try again tomorrow?
... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?
You've got to tell me what happened?
That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.
Promise me one thing.
This is the hotel San Domenico?
What?
I brought Johana to meet you.
In my apartment?
Louis, we were French!
Does that have a hidden meaning?
No.  I'm just depressed.
What is it honey... the frenchy?
They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet.
You've made me a happy insurance person.
I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
Well, for starters, we're going to honeymoon in Boca for a week. And then, when we get back, Morty's been talking about taking a stable, good paying job as a consultant for the JDL.
Yes Esther.
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?
Mom! We're eating!
But we're not open on Sundays.
You watch your back Hammer. Hanukkah might just be his first move. For all we know Kwanzaa could be next. There's a lot of brothers counting on you. If you fail...
It's gonna be tough, but the back entrance looks like our best bet.
Hey everybody. How's it hangin'?
What should I charge?
Bootleg copies of the Frank Capra classic, 'It's A Wonderful Life.'
So, how was I?
I can't understand that fancy talk.  You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?
I don't know.
I'm sick.
What's left of him.
Rosita  I have wondered -
It may sound like music to her -- I can do better with my teeth in a cold Shower.  Click  click  click.
You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life - and I still don't know what the Procession means.
Well, I'd best be off.
Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.
Doc -- something you said the other day --
Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.
Come to look around?
You know a lot. You've taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff - - what kind of a man would kill like that?
That was unfortunate.
Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith.  I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.
What are you getting at?
You won't go to Galbraith with me?
Makes no difference. Get him out!
I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
You're too good to me.
Who was the other man?
Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.
You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --
Hot...  These roads all round here, closed to the public... Whys that? Military bases?  Huh. I guess theres space enough for war games... Must be good for business.
Nobody? Huh!... How come?
I found this at your brothers.
Disney! How inter...
I cant tell you that yet. But hes being well looked after.
Perhaps I should come back when youre...
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. Ill give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
Im really sorry you were not called...
Youre repeating yourself, Mrs De Moraes.
Have you finished?
Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? Hes a client of mine and a friend of your husband.
Your brother stumbled upon Adoniss little secret, didnt he? And traded his silence for a kid and some cash. And Adonis fell for it, bought him his kid, sent him away, and then killed him when he came back for more.  Leon didnt come here to borrow money for prints. He came to extort a second kids life. Your flunkey let him in, so his visit couldnt be concealed, hence the exhibition story. There was no exhibition. Just as you suspected. Remember, Deborah? Leon does his own prints. Wouldnt want anyone to interfere with his Art.  I should have paid more attention to your words. Perhaps its the way you say them...
Think what you like. But dont presume to understand.
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
Here we go again.
Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr...
Thereve been 7 international treaties since 1904 aimed at preventing child slavery. But still no worldwide body dedicated to investigating the maltreatment of children used in sexual exploitation. Officially, its just not called for. Sit down. Can I offer you some coffee?
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassys out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
How come youre alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
Route 395. Past Edwards Air Force base and about half a mile before a place called the Red Mountain Motel. Theres a dirt track with a Closed to the public sign. It leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere. If you havent heard from me by morning send the cavalry, okay? But not before, you hear?
Look, you dont tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldnt imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Whos the guy? The Austrian?
Friedmans dead... They killed him...
Hi...
What sort have you got?
Fifteen for a straight delivery. Twenty with the provision of a safe place. Visitors tend to find the second option more convenient.
Where is the Austrian?
I dont know. Hes gone!  Hes gone. I dont fucking know where, I swear... Hes gone. On holiday...
...On holiday?
Yeah... The Diplomat.
Finsbury Park. Were in Finsbury Park.
There were six on offer, you scumbag. Where are the other five?
The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?
I dont know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
I came to feed your fish. I didnt know...
Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say youre my secretary, all right?
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
Look Mrs Spitz... I dont know to whom Im indebted for the recommendation but... Im not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.
You wouldnt be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
What happens now?
Problems?
Clients come and go.
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
Maybe I dont.
Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who cant do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
Who are you? Who are you working for, huh?
What is it?
What are you talking about?
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
Leon? No. Im afraid he left.
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
This is private property. The public footpath is back to the left of the bridge.
Shut up! Wheres your wallet?
Did Leon tell you why he didnt want the police involved, Rhian?
He just said he had good reasons.
Do you know Leons parents names?
Who else knows about the boy?
My sister... She lives in the next valley.
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
Welcome to the club.
What about which girlfriend?
Yeah! Somewhere in Wales. I dont really know her. Used to turn up in a Transit van on weekends, sell old furniture at Camden. Thats how come he only laid her at weekends, ha ha...
A lachat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais a pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. Cest pas vraiment mon truc.  I dont know any Austrian, Xavier.
Figlio di puttana. Youre the French asshole who bumped off the London guys...
Very funny. Can I go on now?
What do you mean?
Majesty, I can't...
I thought you were an archer?
I'll go.
He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
No, but...
But it is what I want.
Get back inside the town and see if the English are attacking from the other side!
My gentle Captain... I'm staying.
I -- I don't understand...
One day you will.
And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?
To avoid killing anyone.
No, of course not... I never killed anyone...
Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...
Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is.  This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
It is not for us to burn her, my lord.  That is your prerogative.
You will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked.
I assure you they do.  So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?
Praying.
I didn't mean it!  I didn't know what I was signing!  You tricked me...!
I don't understand, Jeanne... why did you do it?  Why?
W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?
Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
I'm... I'm not the king...
I don't need lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans...
... You look wonderful...
You mustn't see her, my lord.  We know nothing about her... we don't even know if she is from Lorraine.
You told us about the appearance of this... voice.  What exactly did you see?  Part of it... or all of it?
His face.
But if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel... or a man... how would you recognize him?  By what he said?
It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!
I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!
Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men!
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
Did your voice tell you to jump?
La Hire, I'm warning you -- don't swear!
Prepare these as battering-rams!
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
Who gave you that horse?
No.
What have you done to me?
Oh?  And just because you realize now, everybody else should forgive you?!
I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
I don't understand.  What do you want from me?
They won't come anyway.
God asked you to do something?
No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
Are you going to leave me too?
Yes I am.
Yes, my lord.
He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.
Oh yes... very.
And your mother -- everything's fine with her?
Good, good.  And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?
And what about your other friends... you don't like playing with them?
Him?
I heard about your sister, and I... understand your pain...
I realize your anger, Jeanne, but we must learn to forgive.  It's hard, but revenge will never bring about peace.
I want to be with him always...
I came specially to meet you today. I love your playing, but what a day to choose.
I've always loved your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
Dorota!
That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!
I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.
And how's Yurek?
I'll be fine.
What's happened?
The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej. They're bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once.
Believe me, they've picked him up.
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
They bombed us, we're off the air.
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
It's not funny.
Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.
You go to Heller, did I ask you to talk to him?
It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
What are you reading?
But I want to help, I want to.
You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
Jurek? Wladek Szpilman.
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
You made contact?
And what do you think you'll do while you're setting up a new line of defence? Wander round lugging your suitcases?
You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?
What the hell are you doing?
I was... I was trying to open this tin.
Are the Russians here?
I don't know how to thank you.
I can't imagine a fate worse than being dumb. Turn around.
I don't want to learn.
No, but her words are in my head.  I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.
He says you're not to see her or he'll chop her up!
Hello, then.
Play a gig.
You the owner here?
Best we had was Cat's Eye in the second at Del Mar, and he was only 5-2.  Not many longshots comin' in today.
Yeh, go ahead.
You just sit tight, old man.  We're gonna have to get you to a doctor.  I'll call a cop.
It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now.
I dunno.  That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.
What do we do?
He's not comin' in.  Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
Granger, this is Combs.  Why haven't we heard from ya?  Everybody else is in.
Buck Duff.  I was in Maxwell's boost in Troy.
You the Duff that didn't come up with his end when Little Jeff was sent up?
I like griftin'.
No, we checked his story with a tipster.  He was cleaned by two grifters on 47th.
I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?
You mean you blew it.
Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.
You gonna stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat?
I wanna play for Lonnegan.
I'll take him anyway.
What's the matter, kid?  You're not sayin' much.
Yeh.
The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.
All you gotta do is show up with some money and look like a fool.
Looks like he's sulking.
Never get enough, huh pal?  I'd think you'd get tired of losin', Honnigan.
How do I know you're tellin' the truth.
Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.
What the hell's the matter with you. We coulda met at a club or somethin'.
I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse.  All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony.  There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time.  We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call.
And you were gonna pay me back?
'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
You stayin' in or not?
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
What happened to your face?
Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.
Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.
Yes.  He admitted it.
I can't help it.  You don't know.....
Do you think I care
What is it?
Mother ....  you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.
Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.
There. 
Dead?
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
He can stay home.  Please, Dad, won't you?
It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
Poor Dad, does that still bother you?
But it isn't bad weather now.
Better get home before it is.
Not at all.
Well, I've got my alibi.  I was at the Public Library.  Where were you?
What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!
Who's is it?
Oh, that's a phoney.  The men didn't even have to go down.
You've been there?
No proof?
They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.
"D.W.R."  That case you worked on... the guy who threatened to kill Wynant... what what was his name?
I wasn't in.  My secretary took the message.  He left word for me to meet him at the Plaza.
When was that?
There are a few things we want to check up on.
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
You did!
That's a lie, Lieutenant...  Anybody that says that is a liar.
How'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?
I'll get some.
But what if you need more money?
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
But he has nothing to do with it!
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
You did... where?
He's all right. He'd like to see you. But listen...  What's the law doing to me?  Do they think I did it, or is it just something else to pin on me?
I'd tell you if I knew. But I'm not in this.  Ask the police.
That'd be very smart.  That'd be the smartest thing I ever did. Me that a police captain's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument.  The boys would like to have me come in and ask questions.  They'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. Now I come to you on the level. Studsy says you're on the level. Be on the level.
Morelli -  You knew Julia.  Was she gypping Wynant?
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
You got types?
Six Martinis.
I can't lie here.  I've got to get up and trim that darned Christmas tree.
I think I would like that drink.  I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
Finished with these?
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
What are you going to do?
Nick - I won't have you going down there.
You dog!
Wynant's body?
You don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
Why not?
I want to lie low till I get the whole dope.  I don't want to go off half-cocked.
What are you going to do?
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.
Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.
I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.
You can save that and tell it to the police.  They'll be here in a minute.
That's what Mr. Wynant said to me. If she re-married, all the money was to go to the children.
Nick Charles here?
Bonds, sir?
I know I left them there.
Who fired you?
Turn the car around.
Well, based on my knowledge of the region, its culture and her people I would have to say it's a box.
Paper.
I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
For climbing.
What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
What do you figure it to be?
You got no reason to do that!
You got no reason to hit me.  I'm getting tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around.
Get off him.
What happened?
How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it.
I'm not going to let you kill him.
You've got an awful lot of orders in you. Always giving orders.
In the flack jacket.  Still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat. Took the air right out of me, but I was just unconscious for awhile.  'Course, you didn't stick around to find that out. You left me for dead.
Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
Wes--
Thanks for taking care of this for me.
We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
Third.  What you're going to do with your third.
You're getting gold, and you're going to blow it on wheels?
Oh, that's fun.
Steady it out!
Look at it.  LOOK AT IT!  Shot to hell. It's been leaking gas since the fire fight.  I told you to check for damage.
What do we do with the Humvee?
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!
I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.
They're doing more than slapping.
Something like that.
What are we going to do?  What the hell are we going to do?
Must be a compartment.
Wes might be right about that.
How!?
No.
They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.
I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.
Makes two of us.
I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold.
Don't you touch it.
The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
Even if they are Iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile.  Got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war.  They don't want any trouble.
What did you say?
I don't know!
It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack.
But...
Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you.  But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
I don't think we'll go to war.  We shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  It should be decided regionally.
It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.
How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm horny."  I can use that now.
He says it's a box.
I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.
What?
Jaeger?
You ever think about it?  You ever worry?
It's...it's...I don't know what it is.
We have to go back.
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
If all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself.
What the hell are you doing!?
You're going to burn up in those.
Stress category.
Drug evasion with assorted perversions
You've seen enough.
Now...now, I'm sorry...don't - don't....please.  It's just... I was happy.  Why get me involved? You told SEN that you weren't satisfied with me.
I said what time is it?  How long was I out?
Three!  I'm going to be late for my shift.
I'll try.
What are you doing here?  Is anything wrong?
It's all right now, shhhh it's all right.
Are you all right?
Oh, THX... hold me, hold me, THX holds her tightly, tears in his eyes.  They kiss, and LUH hides her head in THX's chest.
It's the end.
What?
I can just barely see him.  I think he's leaving.
Well?
I don't know.
You have to!....I'm 1138 THX Magnum manipulator 347 cell 94107 Precinct 3 Residence:  Level 6421 Complex 12 Ramp 5.  Roommate 3417 LU...H.
Would you like part of this? ....It's not much.
She's not there
Where's LUH?
Where did you get this?
High-grade det cord. This girl, either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition.
What was-? Why...?
What?
Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
More metal... sharp edge...
That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...
Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.
Whadaya mean?
Any word?
You okay?
No... No more killing.
What the hell's going on?
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.
Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?
She didn't work out, had to cut her loose.
Reilly, Vice. I-
What?
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
What?  I may lose it again? But I haven't found it yet! I'm sorry. Goodbye!  Yes?
Yes.
Eleven o'clock! 
And then what happened, M'sieu Filiba?
I'm sorry, but I don't seem to recall the occasion. No, I'm afraid ...
Goodbye, M'sieu Filiba. 
Yes!
I don't care <u>what</u> you say! In Constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas--
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
Yes, Baron?
But please, Baron. We're not supposed to breathe a word of it. You won't tell anybody I told you?
You can trust me.
I hope so, too.
And you, M'sieu Giron, seem to be disturbing my examination of <u>this</u> <u>report</u>.
And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.
Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?
Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.
You have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. You must be a man of about-- about sixty-five.  Let's see--  You will be exactly eighty-seven when you come out of prison.
M'sieu Monescu!
Now just a minute, Major--
Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.
No, thank you.
I like you, Baron.
Monescu!
Gaston Monescu.
Seven and nine!
yse seven, eight, nine, two.  We have to clear out.  Railroad station? Ticket office, please.
Well, we'll have to take what's here. A bird in hand is worth two in jail.
<u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!
But, Lily--
Lily-- 
Yes.
What's wrong now?
That's what you need!
Make it out to cash!
It <u>is</u> beautiful. But I got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so I gave it to my secretary.
This used to be my secretary's room.
Then you use the wrong lipstick--
Good night.
You're conceited--
I <u>must</u> go.
Ah, let me have a little fun.
Yes, Gaston?
<u>Adolph</u>?
And you expect me to believe that?
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
Madame Colet, I've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years.  I was a school friend of your husband's ...
He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.
Well--uh--yes and no.
No, he <u>works</u> too much.  He's chained to his desk. Too much detail. Now, if you could take over some of his work--
Well, in times like these most people are cutting salaries, but suppose we say, in your case, three hundred and fifty?
Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--
How much time?
The ship will sink.
Please tell only who you must, I don't want to be responsible for a panic. And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats?
Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
Shit.
What?
This is Brock Lovett. What can I do for you, Mrs...?
Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
You told me to change.
I had hoped you would come to me last night.
Just a soupcon of lemon...  ...it improves the flavor with champagne.
How you two doin'?
I don't understand a one of you. What's the matter with you? It's your men back there! We got plenty a' room for more.
We've struck ice.
No.
HELP! HELP!!
You're welcome. Rose.
I think you must have had a love affair with her...
You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
Jack, I --
I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.
Where to, Miss?
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
You jump, I jump, right?
You must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless... promise me now, and never let go of that promise.
I don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm, in 24 years at sea.
Just tell us what you can --
Don't look so uncomfortable, Lee--it interferes with your good looks. Give me a cigarette.  What did you do--persuade her to come on this voyage with you?
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
I can think of nothing nicer. It's very kind of you to invite me--
Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.
No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?
I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three. 
And I'll lay odds you got that bracelet.
Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>--up here in the moonlight.
A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
Don't rub it in.
Sorry.
Sally--!
Lonesome?
I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
You can't lose me, Sally--I'm no lily myself!
Not here--follow me around the shed.
If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship. 
A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
You don't think--?
Yer lucky I'm here at all. I tell you, Jimmy--my feet'll never hold out.
You take some awful chances.
Have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check--and bring the cash here.
Thank you.  I owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change.
You keep it-- 
<U>Me</U>!
I thought you were a sucker--
You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
Why?
Don't get yourself all worked up--
No--I'll take Sally and give you the best of it.
Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but <U>that</U> would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd just like to live <U>my</U> life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin <U>hers</U>--Do I make myself clear?
Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
What's that?
Send that.
Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--
That's me!
Maybe he just travels in bad company.
Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
Do what--
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
I'm getting seasick--
H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
With your dry wit and humor--
Get that out of your trunk.
Then, after the first number, I tell the one about the Scotchman trying to open a Pullman window--the Scotchman says to the window--"Gee you're tight."-- and the window says--"You loosen up a bit and so will I."--Good?--And then I do the one--  Oh--you don't like it, eh?
You're wasting your time--she's a friend of mine.
The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
All right--but what is there to face? It's finished.
He's all right.
Yes, Yes!
I thought I had our sailing covered up--  --and here it is.
Telegrams.
I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
Newcomers, eh?  Names John Behan, I'm Cochise County Sheriff.  Just Hit town?
Gave all that up.  Going into business.
I saw that look pass between you And Wyatt at the fight.  Listen to Me!  You're mine!  Understand? You're my woman and I'm your man.
Beauty, ain't he?
Look, I don't want any trouble With you but that's my horse and I mean to have him back.  One way Or another.
This brand.
I'm sorry.  If there was any other-
Credat Judaeus Apella.
Ecentus stultorum magister.
Here, Doc.
I calculate that's the end of This town.  And let's don't bother About the luggage, darling.
You don't even know him.
How you feeling, Doc?
What's that mean, Doc?  You know I Don't understand when you talk up High like that.  You mean you Don't want to be my lovin' man no more?
Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?
Very instructive
Well yeah.  Pretty much.  I mean I Was no angel when we met but People change Doc.  I mean sooner Or later you gotta grow up.
I see.  And what would you do if "she" walked in her right now? WYATT "She"?
Doc...
What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes him do the things he does?
Well hell, Wyatt.  Wyatt, I want You to meet Father Feeney.  Father Feeney's just been initiating me Into the mysteries of the great And ancient Church of Rome.  You See, it appears my hypocrisy Knows no bounds.
How you feelin', Doc?
First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own.
All right.  Then what?
You tell Ringo... just tell him I'll be there.
Wyatt, I... I ain't got the words.
We've never actually met.  My Name's-
Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed.
I must say this certainly has Been an unexpected little Windfall.
Josie... No, I'm gonna call you Sadie.
I didn't mean it that way.
Come up to the fire, honey.
Long as I live I'll never Get used to that sound.
Honey, I gotta start makin' money.
Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, Really.  Work well.
Thought you swore you'd never Carry that thing again.
Forget it, Ringo.
McMasters, isn't it?  Listen, you Seen a black stallion with-
Wyatt, meet Fred White, he's town marshal.
That thunder's sure somethin'.
You back that Queen again, you Son of a bitch, I'll blow you Right out of that chair!  Somethin' on your mind?
Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you.
Way ahead of you, Wyatt.  You want Us to help you get Ike Clanton And Johnny Behan.  Everybody knows They're the ones to blame for Your brothers.
Talked it over.  We decided we Don't need the money.  Took out 13 Dollars each, though.  Federal Posseman's fee.  That all right?
Look at that.  Busted.  Brand new Money Ward, too.  33 years old And I don't even have a decent Watch.  'Bout time I started Lookin' out for myself.
Acquired?
They're carrying guns in town.
Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor?
- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
Good evening. I've just spoken with the Prime Minister at the economic summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a full update within the hour.  For those of you still unaware, some forty minutes ago -
How did you get this number?
Sir Elliot.
Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?
Briefly.
...So that's what the weapons grade uranium was for.
Where can I find him?
Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
By the way, James: Ordinarily I would never ask, but... Weren't you and that Colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea?
Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
That hardly makes up for the imposition.  Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007.  First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.
- Four wheel drive?
... 17 Beverage cup holders?
Do you feel better now?
It was an authorized test. I returned the money.
I see...
I think I've just seen my next future ex-wife.
Where to now, Jimbo?
Married?
I'll keep that in mind.
I see my date is here.  And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.
... Do you have a gun?
That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
This has got to be a mistake.
... Yes?
... What's Harmsway done?
The reason I invited the Minister here, 007, was to reassure him that this investigation will be handled with the utmost discretion.
But if Elliot Harmsway is involved with that uranium, I want him prosecuted to the ends of the earth.
You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way.
Forget it. No way. I got here first.
Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession.  Ten seconds. Are you leaving?
The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch -
Pencil it in for the next trip -
Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations
How sweet.
Take the men. I can finish alone.
Yes. Shall we kill them?
Oh, no.
I pay my own way.
What did your wife get her?
No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.
Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?
That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up.
Linda, how come you don't see that Sunny puts his shoes on right?
Do you think you won?
It was nip and tuck.
This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
What for?
Son, would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom. My hand is too weak. And would you do me another favor? I don't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me? I have trouble bending over.
Now how far would further out be?
You all act like two roosters.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.
Well, it's up to Suzie.
You must have been really sick.
I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
I'm almost finished. I'm about to come to the punch line.
Boy, that is bad luck to touch a fellow with a broom.
What could have caused this? I just changed this damn thing.
Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. City people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. You don't plant old ways...  ... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you.  It's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don't want it. You sell it to a stranger. You worked your whole life, for what?  I doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. All what we've experienced has no meaning.
You're suppose to teach your children what you know. Junior, I don't have to worry about. Babe Brother is a different story.
What's the problem here?
That smells like fresh coffee.
I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.
Wasn't Hocker lynched?
How many people do you all feed?
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
I couldn't believe it when Suzie called and said you were staying here. How have you been?
Harry, that's not nice. I'm in church now.
Is this your house?
What are you doing?
But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
Whadda ya think?
But Mom, I can't find him!
Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!
Next stop...
Which one can I open first?
We're almost there.
Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
According to my nava-computer, the --
Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
I think you've had enough tea for today.  Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.
No, it is.  Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy.
What?!
I can't do it!  Take care of Andy for me!
Woody!  The rocket!
This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at all those presents?!
Oh, that is disgusting.
What?
Sid, give her back!  Give her back now!  I'm telling!
Oh, no!
Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody.
Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh, heh...
No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please!  You don't know what it's like over here!
Hi ya, fellas.  To infinity and beyond!
They're getting bigger.
We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?
Okay, we're on the last present now...
Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...
Boy, am I glad to see you guys!
Curled up on the landing like love locked out!
A sin against <i>what?</i>
I want to go home.
Home is where the heart is.
You're not so old yourself!
Surely she is older?
How long has -
They're going to fly everywhere. Mean things. They should have taken us.
Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.
Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally.
He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
Good.  From now on I want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. Got it?
I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.
Arnie, I need money.  Somebody threatened my children.  They want a first payment of three million dollars.
So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested?
Me, too.
We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing.
Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.
My Leica's gone.
Where are you going?
Not yet.
Hi.
Helena --
What if every country legalized at the same time?
As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some "face time".
Yeah.
How are your grades?
Are you kidding...  I'm staying with you --
You know my dad takes eight red cold pills every day?  He and my mom have cocktail hour every night, from six to seven, set your clock, two bourbons --
Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?
She ain't in on it.
He won.  He was a winner.  That bothers you.
You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
It's a death sentence.  I'll never make it to the trial.
I got greedy.  I decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off.  That was my mistake. Carl would never be so stupid.
Bring this man a change of good clothes.  Has he eaten?
That's good coke.
What's he doing up here?
Relax.  If they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert.
This is fucking crazy.  Instead of killing us, he sends us on a suicide mission.  Do you know who Frankie Flowers is?  He's a psycho-cokehead- hitman.  A faggot.  He's killed fucking who knows how many people. You'd need half the force to get close to him.  And you can't get their help because he lives in fucking San Diego.
Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --
You should feel good about this.
That's your past.  I want to talk about your future.  Would you be willing to do something for me?
If I can.
What is it you want me to do?
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
Salazar's been taken down.  He was working for Porfirio Madrigal.
What do we do?  Okay.  Fucked-up Bowman's turning blue.  Doctor.  We need a doctor.
Well, I've not brought them.
Shag her senseless.
You've stabbed me, man.
Can you not go yourself.
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.
Calm down. You're not going to jail.
What? Steady like?
Actually it's a nightmare. I've been desperate for a shag, but watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should try it with Tommy.
I bet Lizzy told him where to put it.
Exactly. I'm not wanting a cat, she says. Get to fuck, right. So there's Tommy stuck with this kitten. You can imagine what happened. The thing was neglected, pissing and shitting all over the place. Tommy was lying around fucked out of his eyeballs on smack or downers. He didn't know you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit.
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
I'll put the sheets in the washing machine just now.
Right.
One hundred and sixteen minutes.
So who else?
Say something, Mark, say something --
It was my fucking television.
How much?
So?
Your favourite dish.
Regret to inform, sir, that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago.
The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.
Yeah.
It's the great outdoors.
Look, Tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off Lizzy, but there's no need to take it out on us.
How's it going with Gail?
Where did she come up with that?
A walk.
Homeless people?
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
And how did you breach the Barrier?
The ship....
My pain?
Um... yes. We've been caught in a blizzard!
A Federation starship.
You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet.
The power was within you.
Join my quest.
You told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened?
Scotty here, Captain. Transporter is still inoperative. Even if we could lock onto the hostages, we couldn't beam them up.
Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.
I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...
Oh, no. It isn't that. I knew I wouldn't die because the two of you were with me.
There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.
Yes, Captain?
Exactly 15.5 seconds.
Is it possible?
A "t."
There is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room.
Hmmm?
Spock, I thought I was going to die.
We must change our course at once.
Spock...  What have you done to my friends?
Wait!  You know we'll never make it through the Great Barrier.
Your vision?
Are you embezzling?
Hello, Alan.
Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing. While the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object, the computer maps out a holographic model of it. The molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam. Then the computer reads the model back out, the molecules go back into place, and...  voila.
Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on?
It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
Meanwhile, he might find it.
I'm sorry -
Walter, I sympathize, but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy --
Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no MCP looking over your shoulder.
No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...
Greetings, program...
What about our friend - Sark?
You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that.
How 'bout yourself?
Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. Which branch of the service?
New guy...
The Users...you really think they're still there?
You think we can make it there?
Yori... hey...
This is Flynn... the one who busted me out.
You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?
Faisil.  You're new on Harry's team, aren't you?
Harry!  Where are you!
What's this for?
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
Helen's going to be pissed.
Congratulations.  Welcome to the club.
What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
Look, if you ask me everything twice, this is going to take a really long time.  And I have to get home to my family.
Ten, Mr. Gibson.
And you still reach for your piece every time.
Well, what's the point of waiting?
Hello, Harry.
I'm late.
Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth.
It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown--
How long have you been a member of his faction?
That's none of your goddamn business!  What kind of questions are these?
Let me out of her!  Right now!
Yes.
My husband can't know about this.
Now slide the nylons off one by one.
17 years.
She's really a fox, isn't she?
Isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run?
What does she do?
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
Are you sure you weren't followed?
Tell me what happened?
To our assignment.
You're gonna be on "T.J. Hooker"?
Tell him to look through it.
Bye-bye.
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
Not at all. I, this guy here, he's Sonny Chiba.
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
Where's your car? I'll walk you to it.
I love to get pie after a movie.
Well, enough about the King. How about you?
Tell me about yourself.
Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.
Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then?
At the movies?
What would make you think that?
She OD'd, didn't she?
It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself."
Yes.
You better not be fucking teasing me.
How do you do, Mr. Worley?
Why?
I think what you did was...
You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
But knowin' me and you gonna be nigger-rich gives me a whole new outlook. I love airports now. Me 'n' you can get on any one of those planes out there, and go anywhere we ant.
It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.
So you do eat pussy!
Naw naw!
He don't got no right to live.
I don't blame you.
All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.
Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.
Who the fuck are you?
No thanks.
Well, there's a story behind all that. I'll tell you when I see you. By the way, I won't be alone. I'm bringing my wife with me.
Get the fuck outta here!
Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?
You're really in love, aren't you?
Elliot Blitzer.
Clarence.
Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here.
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
Want an animal cracker?
What department?
We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So, I'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you didn't hear nothin'.
He says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants everybody there.  He'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do business. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a sample bag.
Yeah?
It tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the whole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew up with him, the artists he inspired - Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and the fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but they give me the creeps.
But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk.
What?
You got it all worked out, don't you?
Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.
I got some money I can give you -
Keep it.
No.
I don't believe you.
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
That was a good fuckin' movie.
You're no longer an extra -
Nicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in Denmark, 'cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're sweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him.
I'm tryin' to find my jacket.
Yeah, that's right, laugh. It's so funny, oh it's so funny.  There used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their pussy licked. Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with white boys. And white boys are freaks for that shit -
Do you live here?
How do you know? You been there?
We want you to tell us about last night.
To be determined by the proper authorities.
He's drugged out of his mind!  He's completely zoned out.
But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.
Forced you!  Why would someone force you to take drugs?
Do you know why you're here, James.
You're afraid of germs?
You think it's July of 1995?  That's the future, James.  Do you think you're living in the future?
It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.
Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!
Mason???
It would be great if I'm crazy.  If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay.  I'll never have to live underground.
I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid.  Where a boy...
It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...
A Carpet Cleaning Company?
I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid.  It was on TV.
What's that mean?
What....???
What...???
That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
County Hospital, right?  1989.  The "Immaculate Escape" -- am I right?  Why, thank you -- you look wonderful, too.
I asked you, why did you volunteer?
Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't an inquisition.
I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...
You want to go in?  Examine him?
What?  What did you say?
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
You're a hell of a pessimist, old man.
We all got plans.  I planned on seeing all my life.  I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.  I don't guess I'll be seeing you again.  Take it easy.
Nothing.
A coin's got two sides.  When you flip it there's a fifty-fifty chance it'll be heads or tails.  Boyd thinks if you flip a coin ten times half the time it'll come up each side.
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
But, in particular?
Yep.
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
You want to take a look at my car? I think the radiator hose is--
That'll make five in a row.  Never seen it so hot.  Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed.  I'd rather just lay there and try to catch a breeze.  I was in Mexico this one time--
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
How much time?
You got to be more careful.  I remember one time--
Truck stop up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
How much!?
I don't have a credit card.  They took my wallet.
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket. That's going to run you another fifty.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Please, just leave the car alone.
Now that you're so well off, can I get you something, Hon?
We ain't got no Beck's.
No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.
Ned!  Now look at what you done! Are you all right?
Is that right?  Can't say as I blame you for wanting to head out for a bit.  I know I've had my fill of this town.  Sixteen years I've been the law and order here.  So long I forgot why I ever wanted the job in the first place.  Help people, I guess.  Keep the peace.  Problem is there's so much peace around here they don't much need me.  Got a lot of speeders, but they're speeding through miles of nothing so I can't hardly blame them.  Other than that, well, there ain't much to steal.  I reckon that the last big crime we had was, what would you say Mrs. McKenna?  A murder?
Is that the way you want it, boy?  A bullet in the head in the middle of the desert?  Ends like this and you won't be able to spend a dime of that blood money.
Jake.  I thought you would be at work, dear.
My cup runneth over, beauti--
What happened to your hand?
It's nothing.  Really.
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
Drove into Sierra?  What for?
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
Where'd you learn to do that?
From my father.  He was the tribe's Shaman.
You never did answer my question.
I'm guessing no.
I can't.
Yeah, a bird in a gilded cage.
Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.
I thought you would be on your way to Vegas by now.  Is there something you wanted?
Because I know you're full of shit.
Get it, and put the money in it. Pack up anything else you want to take with you.
I . . . nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell . . . that's all.
That's all talk.  He's got nothing on us.  He let you kill Jake.
You're crazy, you know that!? You're fucked up!?
He was a crooked bastard.  He would have killed us.
Someone will find me.
For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!
Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
John Stewart.
Just ran into a little trouble.
I'm surprised to see you.  I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now.
This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.
For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday.
Do we shake hands?
I'm curious about something.  I'm wondering just how it is you happen to know where the bedroom's at.
This morning when I came in on you and Grace, you swore you hadn't so much as been near the bedroom.  Now you make straight for it.
Don't Jake me, boy!  It's a big house.  Odd that you would know your way, except maybe you've been in the bedroom before.  Maybe with Grace to keep you company.
Christ, Jake, please--
Sense?  If I had any sense I would have killed you this morning and been done with it.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.
Toby!  Toby Tyler, leave him alone!
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
For defending my honor this afternoon.
I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn't defending you.
But you was going to fight for me.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's cool.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then . . . and then bust those pieces up, and then . . . and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
Give it to me!
Nooo!
A hundred-forty-five really.
He is at that.  No so much a fault of his own.  Poor boy had quite a trauma as a child.
What happened?
You can't do that yourself?
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
Cocksucker motherfucker! Cops. I hear you. Always sneaking around. Thinks I can't see him. Well he's right. Motherfucker. But that ain't mean I don't know what's going on around here. They're all cursed. Yes sir.
So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
Christ, I don't believe this!
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
A lot that means.
I did?
Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
Come to think of it, how 'bout some money upfront?
Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
Got any requests?
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
For what?
What the hell are you talking about?
But he's dead.
So?
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
What the hell happened to my car?
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
You've been there?
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
Look, Harlin.
Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
Thank you, Bobby.
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
How do you know he's still not here?
I'm guessing no.
Walk away.
Nothing.
Try me.
Yeah.
Is it pretty?
It takes a key.  He keeps it on himself all the time.  I mean <u>all the time</u>.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
Stop it.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
I'm not sailing his boat.
My mother died in this canyon.
Can you make it back up?
That's a nasty cut you got there.
Yeah, if you could send it care of...
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, mister.  Let's see, you want $3.25.  You try to have a nice day now, would you?
Help me, Grace, help...
What did I say?
I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.
Oh shit...
What do I do when I'm around someone I know?
Would you like to try going--
I'm not sure.
Why is it, do you think, that of all the professions in the world... you chose protection?
I don't know what you're asking?
I have to go now.
Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
I'm not scared.
Is that right?
He doesn't look very threatening.
You are in the emergency room of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. You were in a serious accident.  How's your vision?
Against a window.
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
No more sitting in this room. I've let it go on long enough.
I fined 'em instead.
I didn't think they'd really do it.
That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife...
Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
You want... a free one.
Yeah, I guess.
She back in Kansas?
Hullo, Bob. Boys, this here is English Bob.
Those cowboys messin' him up?
Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me.  How do you like her?
Yeah?
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
You... you mean...  English Bob killed him while...?
Them's the keys. All you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' English Bob can ride out free as birds.
He's... he's dead.
They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.
You shot Charlie Pepper, didn't you? And you're the one killed William Harbey an' robbed the train over...
On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
About what?
Huh?
An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
You still think he's in there?
You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?
First one what?
Wha... what f-for?
Huh?
Wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.
Should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to Texas first.
Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans.  Bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... I could see shootin' 'em...
How long you gonna be, Bill?
Sally?
Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.
I brung this for when we had to kill them fellows.  I guess we could use some now.
God damn it, Bill, it's rainin'.
I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
Huh? Uh... yeah.
HOW MANY LEFT GODDAMIT?
Me an' the Kid, we'll head over to the ranch an' as soon as we find him, we'll shoot him. Then we'll come back an' the three of us pick up the money an' head South together.
I guess you lost some hogs to the fever.
How many you killed, Kid?
An' if I spot 'em?
Yeah.
&lt;&lt;We were there to buy a man and take him back to Hungary.&gt;&gt;
They'll never stop.
So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?
Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
You are a criminal.
Then who goes?
It's bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup.
I wanted to talk to you. The other guys -
Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.
You watch your mouth.
Well, I'm sorry.
Russian, I think. I don't know.
How are you, Keaton?
Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
We're on vacation.
Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.
Waste of time.
Even if I was to let you talk to him, he won't talk to you. He's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired
I know you liked Keaton I know you think he was a good man.
Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit.
Well I do have the weapons charge. I'm looking at six whole months hard time.
He didn't have my lawyer.
I don't know about that.
I don't understand what you're saying. I saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you.
I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department. He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.
Because he was my friend.
Abrams.  Yes.  How are you today?
This is a nuisance suit.  He's looking for small change.  He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
You thought it was just.
... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...
It looks that way.
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
Well, we...
You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?
My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...
Meth...Methodology and Technique...
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.    It's unsubstantiated and we  can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
I . . ..
You didn't write that figure.  And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
What you thought!?  What you thought...I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
Dr. Thompson...?
You know...sometimes people can surprise you.  Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anaesthetic...the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of ...
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
Do we have time this morning to... All right.  Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out...They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case.  Now this is it today.
Overruled...
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
Mr. Galvin's...
Yes.  Price...
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
What Hotel are you staying at?
Really.  How wonderful for you.
What...?
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed.  It's all right. I'll stay here with you.  It's all right.  Come on...
You're talking like a drunk.
And it's over...?
I...do you want me to leave?
Who told you that?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
You're pressuring yourself...
Is it over?
No.
Hi, Mickey ...
Uh ...
Come on.  Let's get a drink.
Yeah?  How's our new witness?
Are you with me...are you awake...?
`You guys are a bunch of whores...uh...loyalty...you don't care who gets hurt...you don't have any loyalty...'
What the hell are you doing here?
I don't want to leave her.  Dick ...the, the ... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will ...
... I understand ...
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
I used to be a nurse.
Well, well, well.  Huh?
Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care.  Scottie --
I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
But you knew about this.
And when she goes to those places...
He had no right to say that. It was my responsibility. You didn't know her. I shouldn't have got you involved.
Hello.
What for? Who are you?
Just let me talk to you.
You're not far wrong.
I told you! Right here!
Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
You want me to dress like her?
I don't like it!
The color of your hair...
Oh, no. You'll muss me.
I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else?
Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
Can't you see?
No!
I... didn't know where you lived.
No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
I couldn't mail it; I didn't know your address. But I had a landmark. I remembered Coit Tower and it led me straight to you.
Have you been here before?
Take me away from here?
I'm responsible for you now, you know.  The Chinese say that once you have saved someone's life, you are responsible for it forever. And so I'm committed. And I have to know.
Would you know the room?
There's a name on the gravestone.
And it's a all real.
Valdes. Miss Valdes.  It's Spanish, you know.
Carlotta Valdes?
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
Would you please go and look?
What's tomorrow?
Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
How do you know? Personal experience?
What do you mean?
I know. Everybody tells me.
Uh-huh!
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
Three whole weeks.
Who's the guy, who's the wife?
Where?
All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
She'll be out in a moment.
Yes! That's it!
I said how's it going?
No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me.
Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway...
What did you say?
Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here.
We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
What?
What does that mean?
You got us into this mess.
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.
That's one idea.
No. I think it's fucked.
I tell mine that they're little men. I tell them they're strong. They make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So they really know that I need them just as much. You know. Just as much man. And you know, you're their godfather...
I got you.
So. When is the wedding.
What are you talking about?
Don't sweet lip me.
I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
Micheal? Do you have something to tell me?
Yup.
He's right.
We need padded chairs.
She's all your's Fish. Anything you want. Happy bachelor party.
That is a load of shit. Personal power has nothing to do with any of this. Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this...Well that's just more than the man deserves.
I don't know! I just want to get married.
What?
Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him.
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
Isn't it a little late?
You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
Fine? Fine what?
Whatever you say Kojak.
Not a prayer.
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
Nope.
I don't hate women.
I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.
The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.
They need leadership.
I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.
Florist?
I think so.
Why did you forget the tent check?
Who else?
How much?
Do you love me?
Will you please call the chair people?
Well I do.
Go have fun. Not too much.
We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
No. Just like an hour or so.
What are you talking about?
Call the police.
I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.
You and Moore move the bodies and bury Boyd with them. In fact, put Moore in the ground too.
No...
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
I love you dad.
Everything okay?
Yeah, Dad. It's great.
That's my point! You see Man...burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me?
He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading "Atlas Shrugged," staring at himself in the mirror.
We don't say "love, honor and obey" anymore. And we don't say "till death do us part." Today we say, "respect, honor and cherish, as long as you both do love." How does that sound?
Liz do you take Fisher to be your beloved husband, to respect, honor and cherish him till death do you part?
...regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, ape-like state...
The stone age.
A mutant species.
I love it. I just love, love, love, love it.
You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect.
No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
They've got a real hen house here! You can't hear yourself speak.
Did you have so little interest in seeing me?
You must think I'm mad.
Ramona! Ramona!
So, Ramona!
And this chest?
Why?
Don't forget the meeting with the lawyer. The car will pick you up tomorrow morning.
It's a very big one.
Very, very?
He came in through the cupboard.
In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
Is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows? There must be something.
I have nothing to reproach myself for. All I know is that I've changed. With all my strength, which is not much, I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me. One can also serve outside a convent.
Give the little girl to me. Come here, sweetheart. Are you ready?
She has the face of an angel. What a pity you can't see her.
) Daryl Lindenmeyer was only here briefly, one semester at most. But he was singularly the most brilliant student I ever had in a classroom. He created programs so beautiful, so lyrical, they were almost like symphonies...
It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.
Recognize this? How would you like your old job back?
What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?
Real, my ass. It's an overblown game.  Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.
I watched your simulation, Mr. Barnes. Very impressive. You know, you're the only one to ever go up against Sid 6.7 who is still alive.
Only because I got pulled out early.
How does he know who I am?
This is supposed to be years away.
I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please!
You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
Go to hell.
I don't need a babysitter.
Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better  to improve upon what was already done.
I am impressed.
This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you.
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
Relax. I know what you meant.
I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
Sid?
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
You're with him tonight, watching the President's Speech, when the President...
You know what?  This is good.  This is terrific, and I'll tell you why:  it's <u>cost effective</u>.  This is....
No, this is great.
Well, we paid for it, we got the guys on a retainer.
Mr. President, this is St...
...mmm?
And?  NO.  I don't wanna know.  What do you <u>mean</u> "and..."?
Well, get on the phone, and <u>get</u> it...
<u>IT DESTROYED THE ELECTORAL PROCESS</u>.
Come on.
But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
I'm concerned about the driver of the rig.
You're not <u>thinking</u> right, Pal...
Three minutes.  It couldn't have been over three minutes, the Secret Service...
You gotta give me a day.  I need a day.  He's sick, get it out <u>now</u>.  Get him on the phone'n tell him how sick he is.  We got to get it out before the story breaks, so we aren't quote, responding to it. Issue is as a bulletin.  He's got some rare strain of...
I'm working on it.  Same time, you call Billy Scott at Joint Chiefs, and pour him onna plane <u>right now</u> to Seattle, y'got that...?  All flustered and worried. To talk to the <u>Boeing</u> people.
It won't hold.
What would do that...?
What in the <u>world</u> would do that?
Lookit, don't worry about it.  It's not a New Concept. Wake me when we touch down, will...
...the... 
The American "people"?
Yes
...but...
Why?
...<u>nothing</u>...
What did they ever do <u>for</u> us...?  You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber.
...can we see the Kitten...?
...got to be <u>something</u>.  She gives him the sacred...  And tells him:  this is the Traditional Harvest Offering, given to the Man who Ties the First Sheaf, the last sheaf, whatever the fuck it is...
...but to the Old World; you are stilling the forces of hatred and of War which have, since I was a child...
...uh huh...
Now, the Old Lady starts to <u>Weep</u>, Big Bird shrugs off his secret <u>Service</u>, goes to her, and covers her with his own coat.
Knock on wood.
How long you been up, you need a nap.
<u>Nashville</u>...?
No.  No...Pentagon says, Army's got'em, they got'm in ..."Custody"... 
How's your wife?
And I take this <u>opportunity</u> to suggest that, equally, I admit to <u>nothing</u>, and that I would like my lawyer present.
As are we all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the Security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any...
Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
"...where's my pill..."
AS WE LOOK UP, WE SEE THE PRESIDENT BITING HIS LIP, AND CONTINUING WITH THE SPEECH.
CAIN LOOKS DOWN AT HER SCRIPT.  SHRUGS, AND LOOKS UP.
Whaddaya think?
S'all very well, but when the Fit hits the Shan, somebody's going to have to Stay After School, and who do you 'spose that might be.
What <u>are</u> you interested in? 
"They Got To Know?"  <u>Stan</u>...?  Get with it.  Who Killed Kennedy...?  I read the first draft of the Warren Report, said he was killed by a Drunk <u>Driver</u>.  You watched the Gulf War.  What did you see?  Day after day, the one "Smart Bomb" falling into a building. The <u>truth</u>, I was in the building when they <u>shot</u> that shot, they shot it in a studio, Falls Church Virginia, 1/10th scale model of a building.
Hell, I'd just do it for the <u>hell</u> of having <u>done</u> it, for a story to tell...
Because.
"Freedom."
W...what?
President's speech.
What?
The War ain't over. 
In the Folk Music Section.
...this the Guy.
What's the thing with Morse Code...
Mmm...
Mmm.
Just for the Symmetry of the thing...?
Inaugural Speech, press corp's gonna be jealous of giving up that one...
Guy says he'll respect her tomorrow, he <u>might</u>, but why take a chance?  Hold out til after you're married. That's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em Schumann, make em <u>vote</u> for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain.  Make them pay for him.  Make... that's right, the price is their vote. Now, we bring him home, the President announces he is flying <u>home</u>, he's <u>here</u>, he's <u>there</u>... f'there the election, TA DA, here he is.  Have him say it like I wrote it, It'll be fine. Thanks.  Labor, five bucks an hour.  If you <u>watch</u>, <u>ten</u> bucks an hour.  If you <u>help</u> ... if you <u>help</u>, a <u>hundred</u> bucks an hour.
We pick up Schumann.  Sneak him back inside the Beltway. And we plan his homecoming.  Zt's gone be Neil Armstrong, Dr. Livingston, and <u>Lindy</u>...They're gonna forget, they're gonna forget, they're gonna forget that there <u>is</u> an election...The Pres's gonna have to say, one of his speeches, "Don't forget to Vote..."
He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
Mmm.
I think we were experiencing a Little Technical Difficulty.
What the hell do <u>we</u> care?
Uh huh...why?
What he went through in <u>Albania</u>...
"...unsure whether or not Enemy Action..."
You see?  What's the lesson here?  <u>Never</u> give up. <u>Never</u> give up.
Watch me.
<u>Money</u>?  You think I did this for money...?  I did this for <u>Credit</u>.  <u>Credit</u>, paalll...
It's too clean.
Going to make a little stop back home, pick up my shirts, show him a little treat.
Uh...uh... Mounties.  The Mounties Guard The Border. uh... those Mountie Hats.
I didn't ask for a dog.
Someone's bringing in a kitten...?
No, no, no.... we'll punch <u>in</u> a kitten.  Um... <u>Later</u>.
That's right, we'll take a nap.  We'll get you to Washington, we'll get you Back to your Buddies, and...
Oh, hell...
Gordon, the insurance people are balking on the logging trucks...
Please, no thanks... 
Oh really.
Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!
Thank you, Janet...thank you, Mr. Lynch.
...if I had your looks, better.
Buddy boy, how ya doing?
Buddy, buddy, some buddy; why didn't you tell me to buy Bluestar.
You know what you need, buddy buddy--an optorectomy. That's when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectum--to change that shitty attitude of yours.
you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now, 'stead of going off and bein' a salesman.
I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?
...Got a 100 on me, you...
Don't start, alright.
Don't worry about the loans. I'm doing good Dad and it's gonna stay that way now... least buy yourself a new suit.
Whatever night you like.
Another cup of coffee?
What if he asks where I got the money?
Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in?
Want some?  Gordon tells me you're a very talented broker. What do you like?
What was that?
Yeah, right...
Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor.
...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office. It might spin up to 25 by the bell...
Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...
My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow.
"All warfare is based on deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate.
Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.
What makes you think you can?
And I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Gekko, and his lawyer, Mr. Salt.
Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
Where is it?
Upper West Side.
Sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's. I never had it like you when I was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side.
Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...
Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing.
Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours.
I thought this was an informal meeting. What's he doing here?
What do you say we go get a suite at the Carlyle? Caviar? Champagne? Celebrate, just like the old times Sunshine.
Oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob.  He doesn't even know how to spell  `lady' let alone treat me like one.  You know the last time we went out he  actually made me pay for a drink?
No Jonathan.
No Mark. MARK Why not?
Come on.
This time I really don't see anyone man.
Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.  They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.
Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
They're all human beings
Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
Do you have a scarf?
I know that.
What?
Are you humoring me?
Almost.
I'm sorry?
Uh-huh.  What can be?
Yes?
Well maybe your wife...
Um...yes.
I wanted to apologize.
Your house is so beautiful.
No.  No, I don't.
No, I don't.
Just plain old coffee.  None of that mocha nonsense.
I didn't sleep with him.
Oh my god.  You bought it.
It's niiice.
Wow.  I'm losing it.
Oh...
What?
No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
Adamant?
Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened this door.  There's got to be a way that you can close it.
Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.
It's okay if you're not.
Not the focus.
Maybe we should just...
Of what?
Why?
I'd never be able to live with mysel--
Norman, you have to look at this!
I've got the conference next week.  I want you to feel safe.
Well, that's nice.
That's...
What?  No.  No.
It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered and turned on the music.  She's trying to contact me!
Where is she then?
She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--
Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
Norman...
This is the Feur thing?
Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...
Do I have everything?
I felt you...looking through me...
It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.
Claire, please don't...
And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive...
I tried to break it off!
What?
She can't be here without me.
Huh.
Don't think so.
I'm cooking you dinner.
:What, you're doing Darcy? Since when?
:No, I said, I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true.
But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.
I - r saw him as a child.  Lots of times...  But no one else did.
Michael, Rowan should -
Rowan...
I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in this town, you're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life.
Down here. darling, we figure: If you're taking a trip to God knows where - might as well have one hell of a going-away party.
A Mayfair it ever I saw one.
Better than most, I suppose.
Antha...your grandmother...her life ended there, on the stones. Head split open like a melon.
He's shown himself to you... on the deck.  In the storm.
Stop it!
Go back, MICHAEL... Go Back
- and he seemed okay.  Just banged his -
Explain this to me --- violated...?
you crave what I might show you.  What you can learn.  What I can give you.  So much more than Michael can.
Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...
I do not understand...
Rowan...
What do you see...?
Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?!
It's unbelievable that you can do that.
Really...?  Your family there...?
Too much... too fast...?
All I meant was -
I called Dr. Styles at the Neurological Institute  In L.A., remember...?  He said he'd see you.  He was intrigned.

Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -
Rowan...?
You're just afraid I'll drop dead before I finish the damn house.
Aren't we supposed to love somebody for their moral rectitude or their courage or their beneficence -
Remember the first time we made love - and then ---
Michael - why would he want to hurt Stu...?
That's not good enough.  Why not...?!
Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.
'Leave bees be - and the bees be nice.' Didn't your father ever teach you that...?
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
No tax shelters.  No funding.  I want to fund the clinic - exclusively.  The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic.  I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction.
I'm sorry - I didn't think
Yes, I'm sure you could - but I can't risk you loosing your job
Oh - Tell me ELLEN, I can call you ELLEN?
If you want any - there's some left in the kitchen
So what do you do?
The press think that the WHITE ANGEL is a woman - why is that? Do you dress up LESLIE?
Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE?
You think I killed my MOTHER don't you?
STEPHANIE?
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
I don't like sugar
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
No he had to - he's just - he's out...
It's been what, three years?
It did give me a chance to meet you again ELLEN - It's all routine you understand...So where were you?
I thought it was you - how are you?
Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism.
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
Let me get this straight...
We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.
You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
Ladies first.  I insist.
And I was wondering.
But that smile.
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you.
You have to understand. This was a big shock, for all of us. One minute you're our little boy, of whom we could not be more proud. The next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire.
We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes.
You do know how to drive?
Who exactly ARE you?
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
But we did want you. It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom and dad.
You mean they knew who I was?
I understand.
That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.
That's a crappy thing to say.
Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?
Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
Why can't you be nice to me?
Where are we going?
Not "whatever."  It's two different things.
I mean my father.
It's all so complicated.
You're amazing.
I know.
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
Wearing them?  Or humping them?
Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
Come on.
Only the best for my mother.
I like you, Ted. You know that. I liked you before you were filthy rich.
I'm warning you.
Of course I like girls.
It's not like I didn't have ideas, I had plenty of ideas. But I never even shared them with your father. Never had the guts.
That's right. And guess who's the new King of the Unemployment Line.
How quaint.
She's going to wash your Jeep?
You look pretty.
Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind.  His fingers... his fingers...
Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you?
No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless...
Which she might have saved, if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life.
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away.  And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal.
Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need you...
About a year ago.
That doesn't make him a child rapist.  There's something else.  This girl's had some problems.  Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars.  Ran away...
And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash.
Kelly.  What is it?
Look, he forgot.  I knew it.
That's not your line.
Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...
In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.
But she ran away.
But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her.  Isn't that against the rules?
Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
Are you mad at me?
Why don't you come in, have a drink?
Grab a clue, Sam.  You're a hired hand around here.  Enjoy it while it lasts.
A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
You need that real often?
Aha!
Prepare what?
Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.
Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew it.  He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine.  I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man.
Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
All that jumping and kicking.
Garrison...?  Then the President was right.  Except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again.
At least I tried something.
Thank you.
Excellent detective work, sir.  You should have the honor of going first.
Oh, thank you.
I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
There's only seventy-eight.
Pull the balloon right in front of him!  We'll board the damn thing!
All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
Yes, me!
You didn't tell us you had this on!
Time for you to get off, Ma'am.
... well, of course you can.  Mr. President, what a surprise.  What brings you here?
Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno.
I've even printed my own currency.
He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?
You're not going to use it, are you?
You left me to die, friend.
Yes...?
No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life.
Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers.
Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow.
You!  Are you the mother of that child?
I do what I'm told.
Who is that girl, anyway?
Don't make me angry, Peck.
Hey!  Somebody's coming!
Thanks for your help, Peck.
As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!
Smells like a battle.
You hear trouble.
Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why?  Nobody cares...  Except me.  You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own.
These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
She's in love.
She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
It's not a Nelwyn baby.
Who are you!  Who are you!
What do you want!
No.
What'd you bit me for!!
Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!
Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold.
Obviously.
Amish.
What have you got?
When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
Who else knows?
You made a mistake, Paul. You shouldn't have taken Elton out.
No you're not   You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
They kid a lot.
Does anybody know I'm here?
What?
I should tell you these do not have buttons.  See? Hooks and eyes.
Now hold on. There's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job.
There was.
I know.
Where's my baggy pants?
I got there late, John.
Yeah... I can put it all together when I get back, 'Til then, you know nothing, understand? Business as usual...
Johnny! Where the hell have you been?
You'd lie to protect him.
You're the first one he'll contact.
Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
God, Fred...
No? Why not?
You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way.  But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night.
Get back in there.
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
Seventy --  Dorothy, please!
Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto?  She said she was gonna --
No --
If she...
Uhhhh -- yes...
Ohhh!
Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
Are you ready now?
No, no --  now don't tell me.  They -- they don't understand you at home.  They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
...her face is careworn.
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
...room --
...you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away!
Oil can.....Oil can....
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
Oh! They're - they're gone now.
Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!
And him a brain.
Oh, my!
It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
They're coming back!
...yes.
Ohhhh --
Oh -- does it hurt you?
Ohhh --
You're going to see a Wizard?
I don't like this forest!  It's -- it's dark and creepy!
Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.
Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
The ruby slippers!  What have you done with them? Give them back to me, or I'll ---
...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.
Would...would it do any good if I roared?
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
Sneaking up on me, eh?  Why! 
Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.
No, her dog!
Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and --
That's right.
Did you hear that?  He'll announce us at once!  I've as good as got my brain!
Oh, dear, dear.
Oh --
What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.
You new?
What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!
Whos she?
Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
Hes sealed himself in.
Old friend?
I took the initiative.
Im well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty.
Revenge isnt so hard to fathom. Whats clever is getting someone else to pay for it.
A word? Im sure by now hes engineered a hostile takeover.
Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
Who is he?
Always wanted to see the upper lines.
All this, because you fell for Renard?
Was this all about the oil?
See?  Youre upsetting my customers. What do you want?
A rope!
And the payoff on the tables?
This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
Weve been pawns in someones game. They tricked us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate.  Cock-sure.
What?!
Had a lot of blood in him.
No idea who's behind this?
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --
Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is "stalking" the Watchmen.
Blake?  Dead?
Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
I could stay and go.
Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
Because --
I won't do that.
What -- am I --
No.  I just wanted you to --
Adrian -- you've lost it.
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
. . . That was quick.
What caused it?
. . . And they call me a fucking nut.
I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.
Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
New information.
Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.
Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.
You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.
If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.
I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?
Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?
My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...
Thanks.
Yes it does.
Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this time.
Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
Ten is hardly worth the effort. We're talking a lousy million five U.S.
Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.
Go to hell.
We hung out last night, remember?
Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets.
What are you?
Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
That's alright, I'll figure something out.
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
When can I see you again?
What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.
Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?
Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
This is your standard dart gun.
It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.
This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
Dude, what are you doing here?
I don't believe it! You can't shoot a cop in the middle of the street!
It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.
It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.
And here I thought "anarchy" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt.
Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.
You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.
What's wrong with him?
Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.
The mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change.
I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.
How?
It does indeed, Max.
Yes, my dear, he is.
Oh, shit.
They say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the God-fearing people of this village.  What say you to that?
Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!
Love me oodles and oodles?
Darling!?!
I suppose you're right.
There seem to be quite a few books.
Oh, at least, sir.  The land alone is worth a small fortune.
Well... if you're sure that I could accomplish everything in a week... I suppose I could manage it.
No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!
But wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the re-animation of component parts?
Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
But your grandfather's work, sir...
Are you putting me on?
Yes, that's right.  My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together.  You and I should have a lot of laughs.
Why are you talking like that?
The wockers with the knockers.
Very little decay.  With this magnificent specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain.  You know what to do!
I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?
It's always been one of my favorite names.
If you like -- just hurry!
Yes!  It's all written down in the notes.  Tie off the kites and come down!
It's not enough.  More!  More, do you hear me?
I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
Yes.
You don't understand, Master. The big fellow's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee.
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
There's only one way.
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
Nice!  Nice little balance to it.
Inga!
And look at this, Doctor!
I thought it was wonderful.
Did you do it?
Nor to Elizabeth.
Yes, I have mine.
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
Three minutes to go!
Igor -- are you sure the monster has a good brain?  Are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of Hans Delbruck that night?
An historical moment, Gentlemen.
Tell what you see. Write it well, Sir, and make sure you get it right
Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42
Splendid horsemanship  Who are they?
You intended to bring your reserves across the river?
Are you dictating the strategy of this war, Sir?
The only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.
Yes?
Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
And I assure you, you do not In fact I'd be obliged for your best advice. What have your scouts seen?
